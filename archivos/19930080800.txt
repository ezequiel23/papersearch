~A.%fJkT:
OF ‘MPEHED WINGS;
Each elementof a taperedwing shouldbe treatedas if the

winghad a constantchord eqyal to the chord at that element. That
is the whg shouldbe dividedinto stripsby lineswhich are everywhere a distancefrom the leading edge equ&l to a certain fixed
proportion (.35, .60, etc.) of the chord at that point.

In making

the reduction of load for one-half chord length at the tips the
chord length should be taken as that at the inner end of ~he strip
on which the loading is reduced. The area of reduced loading should
therefore be trapezoidal inform

if the wing-tips are sq~re, and

should have an altitude equal to half the length of its kk@r

base.

TR@lTl@NT OF MULTI~ENGINED MACHINES OR THOSE WITH
MORE THAN ONE FUSEMGE OR NMEILE .
Wherever there is a concentrated weight outside the fuse18ge, as at an engine nacelle, an qyvard load, proportional in meg-

nitude to the product of this concentrated weight by the load fac-

tor, must be applied by passing a rope from the point of ap@ication of the concentrated load q

over a pulley and attaching
weights

at the end of the rope. These weightsmust, of course,be increasedby a properlyproportioned
