AIRPLANE PERFORMANCES AS INFLUENCED BY THE USE
OF A SUPERCHARGED ENGINE.

By George de Bothezat,
Aerodynamical Expert,
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.

The question of the influence of the use of a supercharged
engine on airplane performance will be treated here in a first
approximation, but one which gives an exact idea of the advantage
of supercharging.

The method used may be directly extended to

treat this problem wi +I:r 1 any of the simplifying assumptions made.
1t
These assumptions are made exclusively to allow an easier survey
of the problem.
Let us consider an airplane which climbs first with an ordinary engine, not supercharged, (called in the following case I),
and afterwards climbs with a supercharged

e~ine

(case II), and

let us find the difference of the ceilings reached in the two cases.
We will assume in both cases the power
sea level to be the same and the efficiency
to be maintained constant all the time.

This is quite possible,

to a certain extent for a propeller with an adjustable pitch, a
concluSion reached by theory and experimentally verified.
In case I, we can consider in a first approximation the power

the motor to be proportional to the density, that is, to

be expressed in the form

The fact to be noted is that even in

In the case of cur figure the ceiHng from 25,000 ft. is
increased to 37,000 ft., the supex'cha:('ging maintaining the power
only up to 20,000 ft.

This makes, in comparison wi~h case I of an

engine without supe~cr~~ging, an increase of the ceiling of

about 50 per cent ..
