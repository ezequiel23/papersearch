D. C., December 9, 1915.

PRESIDENT:

In compliance with the provisions of the act of Congress approved
March 3, 1915 (naval appropriation
act, Public, No. 273, 63d-Cong.),
the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics
has the honor to
submit herewith its annual report for the period from March 3, 1915,
to June 30, 1915, includin_ certain recommendations
for future work
and a statement
of expenditures
to June 30, 1915.
The committee
was appointed
by the President
on April 2, 1915,
and held its first meeting for organization
on April 23, 1915. On
June 14 the President
approved
rules and regulations
which had
been formulated
by the committee for the conduct of its operations.
By the act establishing
the committee an appropriation
of $5,000
a year for five years was made immediately
available.
Of the appropriation
for the first year, ending June 30, 1915, there was expended a total of $3,938.94, as shown by the itemized statement
in
the accompanying
report, and the unobligated
balance of $1,061.06
as covered into the Treasury as required-by
law.
In order to carry out its purposes and objects, as defined in the
act of March 3, 1915, the committee submits herewith certain recommendations
and an estimate
of expenses for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1917. The estimates
in detail were submitted
through the
Secretary of the Navy.
Attention
is invited to the appendixes
of the committee's
report,
and it is requested
that they be published
with the report of the
committee
as a public document.
It is apparent
to the committee
that there is a large amount of
important
work to be done to place aeronautics
on a satisfactory
foundation in this country.
Competent engineers and limited facilities are already available
and can be employed by the committee
to advantage,
1)rovided sufficient funds be placed at its disposal, as
estimated
for the fiscal year 1917.
What has been already accomplished
by the committee has shown
that although its members have devoted as much personal attention
as practicable
to its operations, yet in order to do all that should be
done technical assistance should be provided which can be continuously employed.
There are many practical problems in aeronautics
now in too indefinite a form to enable their solution to be undertaken.
The committee is of the opinion that one of the first and most important steps to be taken in connection
with the committee's
work is
the provision and equipment of a flying field together with aeroplanes
and suitable testing gear for determining
the forces acting on fullo

sized machines
in constrained
and in free flight, and to this end the
estimates
submitted
contemplate
the development',
•
of such a te('hnical and operating
staff, with the proper
cqmpment
for the conduct
of full-sizedexpcriments.
It is evident,, thatthere
will ultimately
be required
a well-equipped
laborator_
speciall3
suited
to the solving
of those problems
which
are sure i o develop,
but since the eguipment
of such a laboratory
as couhl be laid down at this time might we_ prove mlsuitcd
to the
needs of the early future,
it is believed
that sucil provision
shouhl be
the result of gradual
development.
The investigations
which the committee
proposes
in its prepare
for the coming
year"o can only-be
carried
out to a satisfactory
degree,
with made limited
the
funds
are
available.facilities
The already
estimates existing,th(, provided
of
committee sufficient
are based on
such line of action,
and on the assumption
that a flying fichl can be
placed
at its
disposal
on
facilities
be not practicable
made
by the utilization
of
nautic
stations
at Pensacola
The estimate
of expenses
is as follows:

If, however,
such
at this time, some progress
may still be

aeroand San Diego.
for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1917,

For carrying
into effect
the provisions
of the act approved
March
third,
nineteen
hundred
and
fifteen,
establishing
a national
advisory
committee
f,gr aer_,nauti,,s,
there
is hereby
appropriated,
out of any money
in the Treasury
not otherwise
appropriated,

institutions,
and among
manufacturers
and various
aeronavtic
societies,
for the
carrying

investigations.
It was found that limil('d
facilities
were available
for attacking
various
problems
of aeronautic
desig-n, and that
same couht be made aw61,fl)!e
to the committee,
provided
funds were available
to carry out the m eessary experiments,
or to engage

As a result
of the investigations
of the facilities

in this
country,
and of the problems
requiring
solution,
it is found
that

covers
lines of development
and investigation

PROBLEMS.
Of the many problems
now engaging
general
attention,
the following are considered
of immediate
importance
and will be considered
by the committee
as rapidly
as funds can be secured
for the purpose:
A. Stability
as determined
by mathematical
investigations.--The
reduction
to practical
form of the analytical
methods
of determining
the stability
of aeroplanes
from
design
data,
without
necessarily
requiring
wind-tunnel
tests or full-sized
tests of same.
ta-1) This
will require
first a thorough
investigation
by competent mathematicians
and ]physicists
of the work so far accomplished
by different
authorities
olprominence
in this country
and abroad.
The publication
of many valuable
treatises
which have already
been
prepared
is not sufficient,
as many
of these treatises
are presented
in such highly
technical
manner
that they
are not in for'm to be
comprehended
by designers
and manufacturers
who are otherwise
fitted for practical
accomplishments
in aeronautical
work.
(a-2)
Another
phase
of these investigations
is the natural
tendencv on the part of designers
and constructors
to assume
that mathematio_,l
theories
are of use only to those who are mathematically
inclined;
and there is objection,
frequently
based on good ground,
that
in order
to arrive
at solutions
of the complicated
equations
involved,
mathematicians
necessarily
make
certain
assumptions
which
are not always
based
on actual
conditions,
and though
the

conclusions
drawnarelogical,based the assumptions
on
made,there
is reasonableoubtif the resultingconclusions
d
app!yto a complete
machine. Until suchdistrustis overcome, englneerin__
true
progress
in the design air craftwill behampered
of
andprogress i_ depend,
w
muchas in the past,on "cut and try" methods.
However,
when
the mathematician
can explain
by a correct
application
of mathematical
analysis
why certain
things
occur in practice,
for which
no
satisfactory
solution
has been found,
a start will be made toward
the
removal
of the distrust
of mathematical
formulae, and real progress
begin.
As an instance
of such application
attention
is invited
to
the report
of Hunsaker
and Wilson,
of the Massachusetts
Institute
of Technology
(Report
No. 1), in which
it is shown
that
although
an aeroplancJ[s
designed
so that statically
it is stable to a satisfactory
degree, it does not necessarily
follow that the machine
is dynamically
stable;
and in fact in the case investigated
it was found'that
while
within
certain
limits the machine
was dynamically
stable,
the limits
of dynamic
stability
were much
smaller
than supposed,
and at low
speeds
dynamic
instability
existed
to such
a de_ee
as to require
correction
in the design.
Such instability
has probably
been the
cause
of a large
num_ber
of accidents,
and yet constructors
and
designers
were at a loss to explain
the cause until demonstrated
by
the test of a model of an actual machine
in a wind tunnel.
B. Air-speed
mefers.--An
important
problem
to
aviation
in
general
is the devising
of accurate,
reliable,
and durable
air-speed
meters
and other
aeronautic
instruments
for the navigation
and
control
of air craft.
(b-l)
The most important
of these problems
is that
of the prevention
of "stalling"
of aeroplanes.
The
committee
considers
"stalling"
responsib'_e
for a veery high
percenta_e.,.of
aeroplane
accidents.
It is believed
that
at present
the possibility
oi stamng
exists in all machines,
except a few which have been specially
designed
to have a high degree of inherent
long!tudinal
stability;
but it appears
desirable
and necessary
to use machines
of a normal type,
because
of certain
considerations
affecting
the methods
of using these machines
in warfare
and also because
of certain
restrictions
_nvolved
in the
performances
of machines
of the inherently
stable type.
The best
means
of preventing
stalling
is the development
of a reliable
airspeed meter, which by its in&cations
will give warning
of the approach
to those
conditions
which
produce
stalling.
A number
of such
meters
already
exist in different
forms,
but none so far developed
or brought
to the attention
of the committee
is considered
to be
satisfactory
or reliable.
(b-2) The Bureau
of Standards
is now epgaged
in investigation
of such meters,
and attention
is invited
to the report of Prof. Herschel
and
Dr.
Buckingham
of the
bureau
on Pitot
tubes.
(Report
No. 2.)
In addition
to the investigation
by the Bureau
of Standards
referred
to, a number
of manufacturers
and individuals
are already
engaged
in the development
of air-speed
meters.
The development
of other forms of aeronautical
instruments
is in a more satisfactory
condition
and is progressing
steadily.
C. Wing sections.--The
evolution
of more efficient
of practical
form, embodying
suitable
dimensions
for
structure,
affording
action.

with moderate
a large
range

_ing
sections
an economical

travel

*_RO_*VXICS.

15

D. Motors.--The
development
of high powered
aeronautic
motors
of the lightest
possible
construction
consistent
with reliable
operation and the maximum
economy
of fuel and oil consumption.
(d-l)
The committee
is of the opinion
that with proper
encouragement,
satisfactory
types of aeroplane
motors
can be de-ycleped
wtu_ch
will rival
in efficiency
and certainty
of operation
the automobile
motors
of to-day
and the best aeronautic
motors
which have been
developed
abroad.
This will require
that
manufacturers
having
capable
organizations
at their
disposal
shall become
interested
in
aeronautic
development
and see a market
for their products.
In the
meantime,
both the War and Navy Departments
are already
engaged
on this problem
and may be expected
to contribute
valuable
information in the near future.
By employing
some of the most competent
engineers
of this country
on investigations
of the many complicated
details
of design of gas engines,
the committee
should be able to make
substantial
progress
on these lines.
(d-2) An efficient
form of radiator
is needed,
which will provide
satisfactory
cooling
for water
cooled motors,
without
involw_n_
too
much
weight
or resistance,
and it is desirable
that the principl_es
of
design
should
be carefully
investigated
with a view to the., :,development
of a type which will embody
the different
quali_ies
required
in
such a manner
as to have _he least unfavorable
effect on the aerodynamic
efficiency
of aircraft.
(d-3)
Ah efficient
form of muffler
for internal
combustion
engines
is necessary
for military
aircraft.
An attempt
by the committee
to
obtain
a report on this subject
has so far been unl_ruitful,
though
it is
hoped
that
satisfactory
progress
can be made in the near future.
The problem
is not a simple one on account
of the high power of the
motors
used.
E. Propellers.--The
development
of more efficient
air propellers,
which will hold their efficiency
a_ high values
over a large range of
speed of advance.
Also improvements
in design of propellers
relative
to materials
and details
of construction,
leading
toward
reduced
weight
and greater
permanence
of form, together
with provision
for
ready
repairs
and moderate
cos_ of construction.
(e-l)
It is considered
that this country
has available
a number
of
competent
authorities
on propellers
for water
craft,
who are thoroughly
equipped
to place
the design
of aeronautic
propellers
on a
satisfactory
basis,
and it is advisable
that the committee
should have
at its disposal
funds
to engage
such talent
on the development
of
propeller
design.
A great deal of work has already
been accomplished
abroad
and is available
for use, and though
high efficiency,
of design
has be_n attained
abroad,
the pro_ess
on these lines in this country
has been limited.
F. Form of aeroplane.--Improvements
in the form
of aeroplane
leading
toward
natural
inherent
stability
to such
a degree
as to
relieve largely the attention
of the pilot while still retaining
sufficient
flexibility
and control
to maintain
any desired
path,
without
seriously impairing
the efficiency
of the design.
G. Radio-telegraphy.--It
is exceeding_ly
desirable
that
the committee
should
investigate
the ques$ion
of apparatus
to be used in
sending
messages
from aeroplanes
in order that
there may be sure
means
of communication
between
the aeroplane
and
fixed base
stations.

PHYSICAL PROBLEMS.

Beside
tile more general
problems,
the following
problems
of a
physical
rather
than aeronautical
natur_
are of particular
inWresi :
2_-. No_worrosive
materiaIs.--The
availability
of non(orrosive
materials
for construction
details
and fittings;
such materials
to have
qualiti(,s
comparable
with thost
atl, ainable
in different
gra(h's
of
steel, both as to physical
properties
and as to rcliabilit.y.
(a2-1) Work or£ tills lineis
already
well in hand
at the Bureau
of
Standards.
B. Flat aT_d cambered
su_faces.--A
complete
investigation
of the
effects of combinations
of flat and cambered
surfaces
joined by hinges,
as is usual in the construction
of rudders.
(b-l) No extended
work on these lines has yet been carried
out,
though
facilities
exist at, the Washington
Navy
Yard
and at the
Massachus('tts
Institute
of Technology.
C. Ttrmi_al
conn,ctions.--The
development
of reliable
te,n_ninal
eonneclio_s
for truss wires, wlfieh will dfvelop,
if practicable,
the
full strength
of t,he "_ire without,
involving,
too much bulk or weight,
and without
involving
danger
due to unusual
care being requirea
in
attaetfing
same;
that is, the solution
must be a practical
and not a
laboratory
one.
(c-1) X valuable
contribution
to this question
is submitted
in the
report
volunteered
by the John
A. Roebling
s Sons Co.
(Report
No. 3.)
D. Characteristics
of constructive
materials.--An
accurate
and authentic
determination
of the physical
characteristics
of all classes of
woods,
metals,
and fabrics
which enter into the present-day
types of
construct
ion.
(d-l)
Considerable
information
on these lines is undoubtedly
available in the laboratory
records
of various
technical
institutions,
but
is not uenerallv
accessible.
The Bureau
of Standards
is well equipped
for this line o_work.
E. Gel_eration of hgdroqen.--The
generating
of hydrogen
economically at sea on a ship rolling in a seaway
is a problem
to be solved.
(e-l)
There are many systems
of generating
hydrogen
on land, but
many
of th(se would be defective
ifinst_dledaboardship.
Any installation
for this purpose
aboard ship should combine
capacity,
compactness
and economy,
and certainty
of operation
to the }fighest
de_ree.
1_. Standardization,
of nomendature.--The
standardization
of aeronautical
nomenclature
is most desirable
for the whole comltry.
(f-l)
This question
has already
been attacked
by the Army
and
Navv, and the reports
of these branches
of the serwce
should form a
good ba._is for the work of the committee.
G St(_ml(mllzatiou
of speci_cations.--Standardization
of specifications for aeroplane
materials
for use of the Government
and people of
this country.
(g-l)
A proI)osition
on these lines from a prominent
manufacturer
has ah'eady been received,
and the committee
has taken steps toward
the development
of such specifications.
It. Bib_,_o_!raphy of aviation.--Revision
and continuation
bib[iograph_
of aviation.
I. _ ',,llcctto_, recision,

J. Limitation
of s/ze.--Determination
of the present
upper
limits
with regard
to size and carrying
capacity,
with special
reference
to
the means by which those limits may be extended,
it being very important
to know approximately
the present
limitations
in size and
carrying
capacity
and to what elements
these limitations
apply,

Causes of accidents.-----Securing
and carefully
compiling
of reports of causes of accidents
in aeronautics.
(k-l)
While conditions
have changed
decidedly
from the early days
of aeronautics
in this country,
thereis
still evidence
of carelessness
in
the desiun
and operation
of aeroplanes.
It would
appear
as coming
ithin tyro province
of this committee
that legislation
should
be enacted
toward
obtainin__
control
of this feature
at an early
date.
However,
any such legislation
should
be most carefully
considered
and the views of those interested
should
be obtained.
This is particularl:_
necessary,
as already
a number
of attempts
have been made
tox_ ard mgislatiou
in different
States,
with the result that in one State,
at least,
experimental
work is practically
prohibited,
not because
inventors
and constructors
can not comply
with the law, but because
the o_cra_ion
of the law requires
facilitms
which do not exist in the
State in which the laws have been passed.
With a view toward
determining
the rcouirements
of such legislation,
it is proposed
that a
beginning
be maple by requesting
that
all accidents
be reported
to
the advisory
committee
on forms to be published
by the committee,
embodvin_
a set of categorical
questions,
the answers
to which may
lead to _determinatio_
of the principal
causes
of accidents,
hi
cases where such accidents
result
in the maiming
or killing
of spectator_
or rivers, such questions
should
be answered
})y the investigating
auttiorities.
The word "request"
is used in view of the possible conflicts
of State and Federal
authority
and jurisdiction;
and
whereas
it is very probable
that both State
and Federal
authorities
would be willing and glad to cooperate
in this work in response
to a
request,
it is not clear that such cooperation
would follow legislation,
unless carefully
worked
out.
STANDARDS

OF

WORK.

While the functions
of the committee
are not considered
directly
to be concerned
with the question
of preparations
for defense,
in the
opinion
of the committee
it is of greatest
importance
that th_ manufacturers
of aircraft
and the War and Navy Departments,
at present
the principal
consumers,
should
come to a definite
agreement
as to
the standards
of work necessary
to facilitate
production
and repairs.
Of the most importance
in tMs line is the preparation
of standard
specifications
for materials
and tests.
In this manner
the _)roducers
and consumers
will have a clear understanding
on which tobase
contracts,
and under the stress of war conditions
the multiplication
of
aircraft
would be greatly
facilitated.

IMPORTANCE OF WORK TO ARMY AND NAVY.

The importance
of aircraft
to the War and Navy Departments,
in
view of the utilization
of such craft in the present
war in Europe,
is
so evident
that
no further
comment
is offered.
It is, however,
strongly
recommended
that
every
consideration
should
be given
toward
the provision
of adequate
facilities
for initiating
and conducting
the
development

important
of both

experimental
work necessary
for the
branches
of the service on aei:onautical
QUARTERS

eificient
lines.

FOR COMMITTEE.

By courtesy
of the Secretary
of War,
the first meetings
of the
advisory
committee
and the executive
committee
were held in the
reception
room in the office of the Secretary
of War, and the annual
meeting
was also held in that room.
In accordance
with the instructions of the advisory
committee,
the executive
committee
attempted
to obtain
quarters
in the State,
War, and Navy Department
Building,
but found
that each of these departments
was so crowded
for space
that none was available.
However,
through
the courtesy
of the Secretary of War, the meetings
of the executive
committee
have been held
in the private
office of the officer in charge
of the Aviation
Section,
War Department,
and the office work of the committee
has been temporarily
conducted
and tile flies have been kept in a portion
of a room
adjoining
the same office.
While such improvised
quarters
for the
committee
served
their purpose,
such temporary
quartel_s are not satisfactory
or suited to the needs of the committee.
Suitable
quarters
can be obtained
at moderate
cost in one of the several
office buildings
centrally
located
in the city of Washington.
It is for this reason the
committee
recommends
that provision
for suitable
quarters
be made
in the next appropriation
act.
EXISTING FACILITIES FOR AERONAUTIC INVESTIGATION
MENT DEPARTMENTS.
For the conduct

of the work

outlined,

limited

facilities

IN GOVERN"
already

exist

in different
Government
departments
about
as described
in general
terms
in the following.
These faciliti(s
can be augmented
by the
facilities
described
as existing
in the different
teclmlcal
institutions,
etc., previously
referred
to:
A. The Bureau
of Standards
is well equipped
for carrying
on all
investigations
involving
the determination
of the _)hyslcal
factors
entering
into aeronautic
design, and is prepared
to taKe up such matters as are of sufficient
general interest
to warrant
same.
B. The Navy Department
is equipped
with a model basin and wind
t umml at the Washington
Navy Yard,
with adequate
shop facilities
for carrying
on the work in a limited
way, and is also constructing
at
the V_ashmgton
Navy
$ ard a plant
for the testing,
of acronautm
motors
and devices
involved
in their operation,
which will be in commission
at an early date.
Also, under the Navy Departnlent
steady
progress
is being
made in attacking
practical
problems
involved
in
the development
of the Navy
aeronautic
service
at its station
at
Pensacola,
and theoretical
and practical
designs
are in hand in the
Bureaus
of Construction
and Repair
and Steam
Engineering.

C. The War Department
has limited
facilities
at the flying school
at San Diego, for investigations
of interest
to that branch
of the service, and is able to carry out in a limited
way experiments
of interest
to the service on full-sized
machines,
for whmh work it has the assistance of technical
experts.
D. Fhe Weather
J_ureau is well equipped
for the determination
of
the problems
of the atmosphere
in relati_on to aeronautics,
and Prof.
Marvin,
a member
of the advisory
committee,
is the chairman
of a
subcommittee
engaged
on this problem.
The work,
however,
will
necessarily
be limited
until
the necessary
funds
for more extensive
work become
available.
There is already
available
in the records
of
the bureau
much information
of value which requires
compilation
in
a form
suited
to aeronautic
requirements,
and
this work
is the
subject
of a preliminary
report
included
in the annual
report of the
committee.
E. The Smithsonian
Institution
has been engaged
for a number
of
years on the compilation
of the bibliography
of aeronautics,
and is
]_)repared to continue
this work for at least two years more with the
Iunds
at its disposal.
The institution
has also contributed
funds
toward
the development
of the work of the subcommittee
of the
Weather
Bureau
in its investigation
of the problem
of the atmosphere
in relation
to aeronautics.

INTRODUCTION.

A model
of span 18 inches, representing
a typical
military,
tractor
b_lane,
was tested in the wind tunnel
of the Massachusetts
institute
orIechnology.
The lift, drift, and pitching
moment
were measured
for a series of angles
of incidence
corresponding
to the maximum
possible
changes
of flight
attitude.
Only
the discussion
of symmetrical
or longitudinal
changes
is given
here.
A report
on the
lateral
stability
of the same model is reserved
for a later date.
From

of the forces and pitching

The damping

was also (|etennined
experimentally.
he method
followed
is that
of L. Bakrstow
in his extension
of
Bryan's
theory.
Notation
also
follows
Bairstow.
The
value
of
Routh's
discriminant,
which
Bryan
has shown
to be a measure
of
dynamical
longitudinal
stability,
has been calculated
for six speeds,
ranging
Irom the maximum
to the minimum
possible
speeds for the
aeroplane
type
selected.
The principal
point
of interest
brou
ht
O
.......
g
ut in this connection
is that
stability
]_alls off rapidly
as speed
decreases
or angle of attack
increases,
and that while this aeroplane
appears
to be very stable
at high speeds, it is frankly
unstable
at
speeds below 47 miles per hour.
This instability
at low speeds
takes
the form of an oscillation
in
pitch
combined
with changing
in forward
speed
and a rising
and
sinking of the whole aeroplane,
which, therefore,
follows an undulatory
flight path.
The _aeriod of the undulation
is about
12 seconds,
and
the amplitude
doubles
itself in less than 20 seconds.
Obviously,
the
pilot can not safely abandon
his controls
at slow speed.
Fhe importance
of this demonstrated
instability
at low speeds
should
be a_)preciated
in view
of recent
accidents
with
military
aeroplanes
when operated
at slow speeds.
The entire investigation
of inherent
longitudinal
stability
was preliminary
to the discussion
of the effect of windgusts.
Naturall:y,
it
was first ncc(,ssary

of the "range" of stability. It now appears that a typical aeroplane
is inherently stable in the sense defined at high speeds only. The
effect of gusts on the uncontrolled aeroplane will, therefore, be
investigated only for the high-s_eed condition. At low speeds the
aeroplane can not be leftto itself still
in
air. Consequently, a discusslon of itscertain destruction if abandoned in gusty air appears
unprofitable.

The general
features
are shown
in the
drawings
of the model.
(Figs. 1 a, b, c.)
The model was an exact
copy of the aeroplane
except
for the propeller
and wing
wiring,
which
features
were omitted.
Also wing struts
were made
round
instead
of "stream-line"
in section.
Since it is well known
that
the resistance
of a series of similar
aeroplanes
varies somewhat
less
rapidly
than
the square
of the speed and square
of a linear dimension, due to skin friction,
it is believed
that
the prediction
of the
resistance
of the full size aeroplane
from the observed
model resistance
will still be a fair estimate
in spite of omissions
on the model.
For simplicity,
the model was made with the trailing
ailerons
or
win__ flaps integral
with the wings.
This somewhat
increases
the
effective-supporting
area.
Also the fixed tail and elevator
were
made in one, corresponding
to the elevator
held fast in its neutral
position.
These points are made clear on the drawings
of the model.

London,

1912-13,

In general,
it may be stated
that the wind tunnel
provides
a wind
constant
in velocity
within
1 per cent, which
velocit3
is further
constant
across
/.he working
cross section
of the tunnel
within
1¼ per
cent.
Velocity
is measured
by a suction
plate calibrated
against
a
standard
Pitot
tube
with
a precision
of one-half
per cent.
The
model is mounted
oll the balance
in various
'_ttitudes
of pitch or yaw,
and in such positions
are Incasured
tile three forces and three couples
p reduced, b y _he wind alon,_ and about
three: nmtually.
I)erl)endieular
axes m space.
From a knowledge
of the variation
of these forces and
couples with change of attitude,
the so-called
"resistance
derivatives"
of Bryan's
1 theory of dynamical
stability
may be computed.
The theory of stahility
also requires
the determination
of tile damping of oscillations
about
the center
of gravity
of the acroplane.
A
special oscillating
apparatus
was built
_or these tests which will be
described
below.
By oscillating
the model in the wind and observing
the decrement
of amplitude
wit_l time, it was possible to estimate
the
"rotary
derivatives."
ARTICLE 4.
LONGITUDINAL

TESTS.

The model was mounted
on the balance
with its win_
in a vertical
plane by means of a vertical
rod driven
into tim body at. the j)oint
shown
on figure lb.
By swinging
the model about
the verticaiaxis
passing
through
the spindle,
the angle of wind to the wing chord was
varied
from + 20 ° to - 8 °. At each attitude
the force across the wind
or "Lift,"
force do'_ul wind
or "Drift,"
and the pitching
moment
about
the spindle
were measured.
The signs were taken
an actual lift, actual head resistance,
and a stalling
moment
tive.
The wind velocitywas
30 miles per hour of standard

so that
are posidry air

at 15 ° C. and 776 mm. Hg.
The experimental
points
are sho_:n on
figure 2, where forces are in pounds
and moments
in inch-pounds.
The precision
of measurement
is within
1 per cent.
For a g_vcn attitude,
the resultant
force, on the model in pounds
at 30 miles
per hour .is R=_+I)".
This
resultant
makes
an

the wind

is observed
to have a pitching

The vector

The vectors
are drawn
relative

The center
of gravity
was assumed
to lie as shown near the intersection
of the propeller

At this attitude,
then,
the pitching

For our calculations
a maximum

corresponding
to angles of wing

The curve of E.H.P.
on figure 3, indicates
that 87 propeller
horsepower
is necessary
for a speed of 79 miles.
If the propeller
has an
efficiency
of 80 _)er cent, the motor must develop
at least 110 brake
horsepower.
Tile original

contemplated
as maximum

of about 80 miles perhour
for a 120 brake horsepower

appears
very reasonable.
As actually

a

a speed of 73 miles per hour is indicated

CHOICE OF AXES--NOTATION--UNITS.
Axes for reference
are assumed
fixed in the aeroplane
and moving
with it in space.
The origin is at the center of gravity.
For steady
horizontal
flight at a given attitude
the axis of Z is vertical,
the axis
of X Horizontal
and directed
to the rear in the plane of symmetry,
and the axis of Y is horizontal
and directed
toward
the left-wing
tip.
Forces along these axes are denoted
by X, Y, Z and are expressed
in
pounds per unit mass.
Moments
are L, M, N and are given in poundsfeet per unit mass.'
A_gles of roll, pitch and yaw from the normal
flying attitude
are
denoted
by _, 0 and ¢.
Angular
velocities
of roll, p_tch and yaw are
p, q, r in radius per second.
The signs of moments,
angles and angular

Moments
of inertia
referred
to axes X,

CONDITIONS.

In normal
horizontal
flight in still air a state
of equilibrium
is
assumed
such that
the power
available
maintains
the aeroplane
at
such a speed that the weight
is just sustained.
Since the lift of an
aeroplane

of its attitude
or angle of attack,
it is further
assumed
that
the attitude
is proper
for the speed.

to the apparent

and is hence horizontal.
Let 0 be the angle of pitch of the

Then normally

At hlgh speed, for example
79 miles, the axis of N is horizontal

At low speed, new axes
are chosen such that the axis of X is still horizontal
but nmkes
an
angle
of 15.5 ° with
the wing
chord.
The axes are fixed by the
equilibrium
conditions
for flight and differ for each normal

The effect
is to move the pitching

TRANSFORMATION

OF

AXES.

It is convenient
to measure
in the wind tunnel
the lift and drift
about
axes always vertical
and horizontal
in space.
For the oscillations of the aeroplane
it is convenient
to consider
the forces referred
to axes fixed in the aeroplane
as described
above.
The transformation is effected
in the usual way by means of the formul_:
m Z'=LcosO+DsinO,
m X'=D
cos O-L

sin O,

where 0 is the angle of pitch of the aeroplane
awa_ from its normal
attitude,
considered
positive
for stalling
angles,
nero L and D are
lift and drift on the model in pounds,
and m X' andre
Z' corresponding forces in pounds
along the axes X and Z.
]?he model
forces
Z', X'
are converted
to Z, 92, full size, by multiplying
by the
square
of the speed and linear dimension
ratios.
The followfng
tables
carry out the required
transformation.
The pitching
moment
M is independent
of the longitudinal
shitt of
axes and varies onlyas
the squareof
the speed.
Curves of 92, Z and M
for the different
fllght attitudes
are plotted
on figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
and 9.
The transformation
of the moment
about the spindle to the
corresponding
moment
about
the c. g. of the full-size
aeroplane
is
given below.

The coefficient

to vary approximately

Similar
tests were made with the model for no wind to determine

wholly
to friction

slightly
to the damping

Likewise

The numerical
results

Note that the damping

RADIUS OF GYRATION.
For the radii of gyration
of the fully loaded
aeroplane
we are indebted
to Dr. A. F. Zahm.
The actual
aeroplane,
complete
with
gasoline,
water,
pilot, passenger,
and other
weights
in place,
was
suspended
from a beam by a chain.
The center
of gravity
was flint
located
by an inclining
method.
The machine
was then made
to
oscillate
in pitch about
the point of attachment
of the upper
end of
the chain.
Light _lys were run to tail and _ing tips to insure
that
the chain and aeroplane
moved
as a rigid body.
Let the distance
from center
of gravity
to point of suspension
be
denoted
by h, y the natural
period
of os_cillation

ARTICLE 13.
BAIRSTOW'S

APPROXIMATE

SOLUTION.

From consideration of the usual relative numerical values of the
coefficients of the biquadratic,
Bairstow has shown that the equation
may bo factored to a first approximation
and put into ti_e following
form:

in which the first factor represents
a very short oscillation,
which
in most aeroplanes
rapidly dies out and is of no importance.
The
second factor represents
a relatively
long oscillation
involving
an
undulatory
flight path with changes in p-itch, forward speed,-and
altitude.
The long oscillations
should diminish in amplitude
with
time, in which case the motion is stable and the aeroplane will return
to its original normal flight attitude
if temporarily
deviated therefrom by accidental cause.
The motion is unstable if the long oscillation increases in amplitude with time.
It will be shown that the
aeroplane under investigation
is stable at high speeds and unstable
at very low speeds.
It is believed that this is truo of all aeroplanes.

LONGITUDINAL

STABILITY

SPEED.

Preliminary
to consideration
of the action of gusts on an inherently
stable
aeroplane,
it _ as desired to analyze
the motion
in still air of a
machine
which could be called inherently
stable
longitudinally.
It
has been found
above that
a typical
aeroi)lane
becomes
less stable
at low speeds until real instability
results.
This result is somewhat
unexpected
in view of the curves
of pitchin_
moment
M, which indicated
static
stability
at all possible
attitufles
up to and including
horizontal
flight at + 15°.5.
In other words,
_3I_ is positive
for all
cases.
The instability
comes about
on account
of the rapid rate of
increase
of drift at large angles causing
X_ to change
sign, and on
account
of the less rapid
rate of increase
of lift, callsing
Zw to become small at high angles of pitch,
burt hermore,
Mq dmnmshes
at
low speed.
From
the speed power curves on figure 3, it a ppeal,s that for angles
greater
than
10 °, we are on the part of the power curve
which requires more power to go slower, "region
of reversed
controls."
This
region
is now found
to be dynamically
unstable
so that
controlled
flight
on]y is possible
here.
But
with
reversed
controls
this
is
doubly
dangerous.
The

The critical

INTRODUCTION.
The notation
here used will be in the main
that
of Balrstow.
(Teetmical
Report
of the Committee
for Aeronautics
for the Year
1912-13,
p. 143.)
As, however,
Bairstow
changes
his notation
in
the first few pages of his report,
we shall begin at the start with some
departures
from him.
If x, y, z are moving
axes directed,
respectively,
b._ckward,
to the
left, and upward
relative
to the driver; if u', v', w' be linear velocities,
and p', q', r _ be angular
velocities,
resolved
along these axes; and if
X', -Y', Z' be forces, and L', M', N' be moments
of forces (measured
per unit mass of the aeroplane);
then tile d3alamical

are the components
of angular
momentum,--the
c_uantities
A, B, U
being the moments
and D, E, F the products
of inertia
relative
to
the moving
axes fixed in the body.
Tile symmetric
aeroplane
will alone be considered
here;
D E F= 0.

(4)

If the machine
is in uniform
horizontal
flight,
all the forces,
moments,
linear
velocities
and angular
velocities
except
u' vanish,
and u'= U, a negative
quantity
in magnitude
equal to the uniform
velocity.
(The precise
backward
direction
of the x-axis
is that
whi,'h is horizontal
in uniform
flight, 'rod h_nce_ b_- this definition
the
direction
of this axis, and of the z-axis, varies in'the
aeroplane
with
the specd.)
If the motion
is slightly
disturbed,
the velocities
take the values
u' = U + u, v' =v,
where

u, v, w, p, q, r are small.

(7)

In uniform
motion
the forces and moments
all vanish.
For the
disturbed
motion
they are small and may be expressed
linearly
in
terms of u, v, w, p, q, r.
3"tie forces are due to three sources:
1 ° the
propeller
thrust,
2 ° gravity,
3 ° the air.
We shah assume
that
the
propeller
thrust
(and moment,
if any, arising from it) is constant;
i. e.,
the motor is supposed
to speed up or slow down under changed
conditions so as to deliver
a constant
thrust.
If t_ and ¢ are the small
tch and roll, the components
of gravity
are gO, -g_,
-g
(see
airstow,
144, _u-w),
and its moments
are zero because
the C. G. is
taken
as origin.
The air forces and moments
may be written
as
X,
Y, Z, L, M, N and developed
as
X = Xo + X,u

+ X_v + X_w

+ Xpp

+ Xqq + X_r,

(8)

where
Xu, X,,, .....
are the "resistance
derivatives"
taken
for
the relative
velocity
of machine
and wind.
(X o and the propeller
thrust
cancel, so do Z0 and g; Yo, Lo, Me, No vanish.)
In the symmetric
aeroplane
half the resistance
derivatives
vanish
and the six equations
of motion
separate
into two sets of ttn-ee each,
one set for the longitudinal,
the other
for the transverse
motion.

LONGITUDINAL MOTION IN SMALL GUSTS.
A gust if not too severe may be treated
by the method
of forced
oscillations.
If the aeroplane
is traveling
on aJl irregular
wind, we
may regard the average
wind velocity
relative
to the machine
as that
which should
be used in the computation
of the resistance
derivatives, and we may regard the departures
of the actual relative
velocity
from the mean
as small quantities
inducing
additional
forces
into
the equations
of motion.
Suppose
first a head-on
gustiness.
This would introduce
an extra
term
of the form
X,u
into the first equation,
Z_,u in the second,
and so on.
If, as a result of the gust, the machine
tilted appreciabl_,
the originally
head-on
gust would no longer be head-on,
but would
have components
ul, wl and give rise to the term Xt,u 1 + X_wl in the
first equation.
It is clear, however,
that under
the hypothesis
of
small oscillations,
w, would remain small of the second order relative
to Ul.
The term
Xww_ could then be neglected
relative
to Xuu_,
unless X_ much exceeded
X,.
We should in eneral allow a gust to have components
u_, %, w_, p_,
q,, rl relative
to gthe axes.
This would take into account
an_ possible rotational
motion
in the gust.
The rotational
motion
oia
gust
may be quite small.
In the discussion
by Glazebrook
(Aeronautical
Journal,
July,
1914, pp. 272-301)
nothing
is accomplished
relative
to rotational
gusts.
Yet it may well be that the rotatmnal
element
is of great
importance.
For the rotary
derivatives,
in the case of
the machine
whose derivatives
are tabulated
by Bairstow
(loc. cir.,
159), are large.
Thus
a term
Mqq_=-210q_
would
be comparable
with X,_u_= -0.14u_if
q_wero 1/700 of u_; i. e., if the gust were a uniform whirl of radius
_00 feet.
In the same way Lv is large.
In the
machine
that
will be discussed
in what
follows
Mq is also large,
viz., - 150.

Possible
methods
of treati_g
gusts.--The
_nly treatment
of gusts
which I have seen is that
described
some_hat
popularly
by Glazebrook
(lee. cit.).
He seems to state,
as the main method
or attack,
that
of small differences
whereby
it is assumed
that
the involved
time over which the motion is to be studied
is divided
into small parts,
and that the atmospher!e
conditions
ren)ain
constant
during
each of
these parts.
By then r(garding

of motion

etc.,

q'h3)At , [,tc.,

it is possible
to compute,
through
a series of intervals
5t, the approximat.e
positions
of the aeroplane.
This method
is, as Glazebrook
states,
exe.ecdingly
tedious,
for At must be taken very small, indeed
only a snmll part of a second in the ease of a sharp gust, in order that
the solution
may be even approximately
satisfactory
for the differential
equations.

to be done from the beginning
for each new type of gust whici1 one
desires
to study.
The method,
however,
is a'pplieable
in all generality irrespective
of the stability
of the aerophme.
'l_he reason
that
I have chosen
to operate
on the basis of small
oscillations
is that after a certain
amount
of preliminary
calculation
has been accomplished
my formulas
will enable
me t'o treat
very
rapidly
a series of very different
types of gusts.
My method
is nut
applie_tble
of course, to machines
which are not stable, for the oseillatl%ns eoul(1 not remain
small with such machines,
but it is probably
doubtful
whether
the motion
of the unstable
aeroplane
in a gusty
wind is of very great importance,
as the instability
of the machine
l"s
not unlikely
to eause indeterminately
violent
motions
on relatively
small gusts.
I have tried to devise methods
which would enable
me
to use graphical
apparatus
for obtaining
the solutions
here desired,
but have been unable
to throw the equations
into a form which lends
itself to such methods.
Moreover,
the coefficients
which enter into the equations
and into
the solutions
at all stages of the work are of such varying
magnitudes
that it is difficult to obtain
any reasonably
accurate
results,
it seems
impossible--I
have not vet succeeded
in avoiding
the _!itIicultv--to
eliminate
the oeeasional_neeessity
of subtracting
numbers
whie'h are
nearly
equal in mamfitu(lo;
thus the accuracy
of the figures is, after
subtraction,
seriousJy
impaired.
As I was aware t.ha.t the data furnishod me were probably
not accurate
to three figures,
I first made
the calculations
with sli}le-rule
accuracy,
only to find that
the final
results beeame wholly illusory,
owing t.o_the difficulty
just mentioned.
I have therefore
had to reeompute
everything
with 4-place logarithm
tables.
Most of the figures which occur
in the work are therefore
4-place numbers.
Those which appear
t.o have only three significant
figures
generally
have
the fourtfl
figure
zero w'hen
oecurrin_
in
fornmlas
eontainin__, 4-nlaee numbers.
In the calculations
towarcYthe
end of the researe"h
t_ho 4-figure
accuracy
has become
reduced
to
three or t_ o figure accuracy,
but it did not seem best systematically
to reduce
the numbers
by the omission
of two figures, although
this
reduction
has occasionally
been made in final calculations.

From these equations
we see that the heavily
damped
short period
oscillation
(roots a, b) is about
34½ times as strong
in w as m u;
whereas
the mildly
damped
long period
oscillation
(roots
c, d) is
about 9½ times as effective
in u as in w.
Moreover,
the short period
motions
in u and w are about quartered;
but the long period motions
are in opposite
phase.
The ampfitude
of the shortperiod
motion
in
0 is about _
that of w; hence for each foot-second
of short oscillation
in w there is about ¼° in 0. The amplitude
of the long period motion
in 0 is about
.006 of that
in u; hence for each foot-second
of long
oscillation
in u there
is about
½o in 0. The damping
of the short
oscillation
is so strong
that the amplitude
is reduced
to about
one-

ninetieth
in one second
where
in the case of the long oscillation
the reduction
is only to about nine-tenths
of its original
value in one
second;
the relative
amplitudes
in the cases of u, w, 0 are more
important
in the case of the long than in that
of the short
period
oscillation
because
the latter
is so quickly
damped
out that
the
swing may not get well started.
However,
the extreme
maunitude
of
the short
period
oscillation
in w as compared
with u in&_cates
the
possibility
of relatively
violent
accelerations
in w; indeed,
it is the
short
period
oscillation
which
may
account
for initial
difficulties
whereas
the long period
oscillation
accounts
for the progressive
troubles,
due to gusts.

The value

if r _1, the two-thirds

It appears
from these equations
that the effect of a mild head-on
gust of magnitude
J is as follows:
(1) The machine
takes up an easy
slowly damped
oscillation
in u of amplitude
about 89 per cent of J;
after the oscillation
dies out the machine
is making
a speed J less relative to the ground
and hence the original
speed relative
to the wind.
(2) There is a rapidly
damped
oscillation
in w of rather
small magnitude and a slowly damped
one of about
10 per cent of J, the final
condition
being that of horizontal
flight.
(3) There is a slow oscillation ill pitch of about
.0058 J radians
or about
.32 J°.
If the magnitude
J is great,
tile pitching
becomes
so marked
that the approximate method
of sohtion
can no longer
be considered
valid'-a
gust
of 20 foot,-seeonds
causing
a pitch of some 6 °. As the period is long
(about
one-half
minute)
the pilot should have ample time to eorrec_
the trouble
before it produces
serious
consequences.
The result
of a tail-on
gust is the opposit5
of that of the head-on
gust and therefore
need not be treatcdseparately.
For the head-on
gust J is negative;
for a rear gust, positive.
To calculate
the stresses
on the machine
or operator
caused
by the
gust we have merely to find the accelerations
du/dt and dw/dt of which
the first is (approximately)-du/dt

= Je--°_a4t(.08

cos .187t-.

16 sin .187t)

- .05Je-.:*.

This acceleration
reaches
a maximum
of something
of the order of
J/10;
and if J should be 20 foot-seconds,
the acceleration
would be
only about
2, or 6 per cent of g--not
a large amount.
The acceleration dw/dt is likewise
small.
(N. B.--The
initial
accelerations
du/dt
and dw/dt should
vanish,
because
the gust starts
from zero.
That
the initial
values are not exactly
zero in the above formulas
is due to
the roughness
of the final calculations
for u and w.)

The effect of the up gust is to set up a small lon_ oscillation
in u
of magnitude
about
0.3 J, a very small oscillation
_'n w, and a long
oscillation
of intensity
.0018 J radians
or .11 J° in 0. The comI)arative effects on the velocity
and angle in the case of head-on
aml up
gusts show that
the up gust is only about one-third
as effective
as the
head-on
gust.
The accelerations
in the case of the up gust are all
small.

It is scarcely
necessary
to trouble
with
the trigonometric
terms
partly
because
the motmn
is less pronounced
than in Case 1, partly
because there is here the secular
term Jt, which will carry the machine
up with the gust and will be the chief effect after the lapse of a short
time.
A down gust is in every way the opposite
of an up gust and need
not be separately
treated.

The effect of the rotary
gust is a long oscillation
in u (the short
one is negligible)
of magnitude
about
670 J, a short
oscillation
in w
of about
17 J and a long one of about
71 J, a long oscillation
in _ of
about
4.1 J.
The comparison
with former
cases may be made by
supposing
first that
the oscillation
in u may reach
some 20 footseconds.
Then
J= 1/33=.03.
The
amplitude
of the oscillation
in t_ is then some 0.12 radians,
which is an amount
comparable
with'
the 6 ° of Case 1.
To get an idea of what J=.03
means,
we may
note that if a gust of 20 foot-seconds
is due to a whirl of the air as
a solid body
with (1=.03,
the radius
of the whirl is 660 feet.
We
may therefore
say that the effect of a whirl of radius
660 generating
velocity
of 20 foot-seconds
is of itself about equal to that of a head-on
velocity
of that
amount.
If, however,
a machine
ran into such a
whirl,
it would
experience
both the effect of the whirl
and of the
linear veloci.t)z generated
by it and would
be disturbed
considerably
more
than
iIit
had encountered
a pure head-on
gust.
We may
therefore
say that if the head-on
gust arises from a whirl of materially less than 660-foot
radius,
the effect of the whirl is quite considerablv
larger
than
that
due to a straight
head-on
gust of equal
ma_,nitude.
The conditions
after enough
time has elapsed
to allow the exponential
term to become
small is
lu=

-610.6

J.

I_--86.2

J.

I0=2.865

J.

It is therefore
seen that the machine
takes up the head-on
velocity,
acquires
a small upward
velocity,
and is inchned
at an angle 2.865J
radians
to the horizontal,
these
effects
being
due exclusively
to
t e rotary motmn
of the air.
The path m space could be obtained
by integration,
but
(like the effects
previously
mentioned)
would
not be the true path
if the rotary
motion
were accompanied
by
horizontal
or vertical
linear
gusts.
It
seems
therefore
scarcely
worth while to find the path.
The value
that
I attach
to this theory
of rotary
gusts does not
arise so much from the fact that
such gusts seem nowhere
to have
been treated
as from the revelation
of the powerful
effects of such
gusts.
When
a machine
is flying low it must
expect
to meet
air
which has been set in rotation
by the friction
of the wind against
the ground,
against
buildings,
or against
trees.
It seems
certain
that very material
angular
velocities
might be set up and that these
might
(owing
to their
short
radius)
induce
only moderate
lincar
gusts.
In such cases,
if they can arise as assumed,

to find

-.0654

the acceleration.
Thus
dw/dl=

The short
oscillation
is negligible
in u as far as concerns
u itself.
In calculating
the
accelerahon
du/dt
the short
oscillation
is not
negligible
relative
to the long; but the acceleration
is small any way.
The effect of an up gust J on u is about
one-third
the effect of an
equal head-on
gust (see Case 2).
The short oscillation
is the main thing in w--its
amplitude
is about
J/4, wherea._ the amplitude
of the long oscillation
is about
J/40,
or
one-tenth
as much.
The acceleration
dw/dt may
therefore
be calculated
exclusively
from the short
oscillation;
it is

If J should
be 20 foot-seconds,
the maximum
acceleration

even a gust of 10 foot-seconds

Such accelerations
coming
upon the pilot in one-half

surprise
and disturb
him.
An addition
of 25 to 50 per cent in the a]_arent
weight
of the machine
could
hardly
strain
it to an appreciable
extent
in view of the large factor
of safety used in the design.
(N. B.--For
an up gust J is negative.
For a down gust the operator
would
lose 25 to 50 per oent of his
weight.)
The path
of the machine
in space is not of great
importance
in
this case.
The chief feature
is the general
drift of the machine

SUMMARY.
I have indicated
the general
method,
based on the theory
of small
oscillations,
whereby
the equations
of motion
of a stable
aeroplane,
whether
free or constrained
to fly without
pitch,
whether
in steady
or gusts
air, may be completely
integrated
in such form that,
after
a certain
amount
of prehminarv
calculation,
the effects upon
the
motion
of a large number
of different
gusts may be determined
with
relative
ease.
_o far as I am aware, n() actual method
of inte__ration
nor any quantitative
results
of such an integration
has previousl_v been
published
with the exception
of the descriptive
popular
lecture
of
Glazcbrook
cited above.
I have carried
through
the actual
deterruination
of the effects of gusts in the following
cases:
Head-on
gusts rising from 0 to J feet per second with various
degrees of sharpness.
Up gust otthe
same type.
Rotary
gusts of the same type.
Rear gusts and down gusts are included
by merely
changing
the
sign of J.
For convenience,
it has been assumed
that the machine

for the gustiness;
as a matter
of fact gusts are

upon a general
steady
wind of other

average
velocity;
but the conditions
of flight in still air and ill steady
air are nearly
identical,
the only difference
being that
in the equations of motion
the resistance
derivatives
are calculated
from the
relative
wind, whereas
U is the actual velocity
over the ground.
It has bccn found that a stable machine,
with controls
untouched,
running
into a head gust of various
sharpness
and of total intensity
J foot-second
will swoop up, with some oscillation
of no serious charactor,
to a new level about
3.5 J feet higher
than its pre_ ious level.
The constrained
machine
will rise without
oscillation
to a new level
only J feet, or a trifle less, higher
than before.
The path ill a vortical plane is indicated
in the diagrams
drawn
for me by Mr. T. H.
Huff.
The accellerations
arising in the motion
are not serious
for
either
the machine
or the pilot.
It has been found
further
that
a
rotary
gust may have considerable
effect--though
in the absence
of
data as to the intensity
and regularity
of rotation
in the air IlO definite
results
can be formulated.
Furthermore
we find
that
up gusts
operate
chiefly
in liftinz
the machine,
whether
free or constrained,
with the gust.
The pat]l in space is _iven in the diagram.
There is
here. in the case of sharp gusts a consiaerablo
momentary
acceleration
in the vertical
which
may reach
a magnitude
of about
1.5 J footseconds. 2 This would
not seriously
stress
the machine,
which
is
designed
to stand
accelerations
of 6 g to 8 g in maneuvering,
but
owing
to its sudden
and unexpected
appearance
this acceleration
might incommode
the pilot--it
is indeed the familiar
phenomen(m
of a
"bump."
It follows,
therefore,
that
the introduction
of the constraint,
whether
by gyroseopic
or other means,
serves only to eliminate
tho
natural
oscillation
in pitch and to diminish,
in the ease of the head
or rear gusts only, the final change
of level.
As _ real" _ust of 20
foot-seconds
is found
to drop the uncontrolled
machine
by nmre than
80 feet in 15 seconds,
flight at low altitudes
is more dangerous
in the
unconstrained
than
in the
constrained
machine.
However,
the
elapsed
time is suiIielcntly
great to enable/he
pilot to check the dip
by a suitable
movement
of his elevator.
To offset any advantages
derived
from the constraint,
we find that
this _particular
machine,
when constrained,
becomes
unstable
at a
speed betwecn
4 t and 51 mile-hours,
whereas
the free machine
remains
stable
down to a speed between
45 and 47 mile-hours.

1. INTRODUCTION.

The air pressures
on the wings of an seroplane,
and therefore
the
sustaining
power
of the wings and the stresses
to which
the whole
structure
is subject,
depend
on the speed of the machine
relative
to
the air through
which it is moving.
The measurement
of thi._ speed-particularly
near the lower limit where the sustaining
power becomes
deficient
and there is danger
of stalling,
or at very high spec(ls where
an
movement
of the controls
may give rise to dangerously
large
stresses--IS
evidently
a matter
of Importance,
and the use of a rehable anemometer
or speedometer
is highly desirable.
The aim of the
following
paper
is to describe
the principles
of operation
of some of
the instrlmlents
which
have been devised
or used for this purpose
and to discuss their characteristics,

GENERAL

REMARKS

ON

THE

PITOT

TUBE.

The
speed-measuring
device
known,
after
its inventor,
_ as the
Pitot tube contains
two essential
elements.
The first is the dynamic
opening,
or mouth
of the i_apact tube, which points
directly
against
the current
of liquid or gas of which the speed is to be measured,
and
receives
the impact
of the current.
The second is the static opening
for obtaining
the so-called
static
pressure
of the moving
fluid, i. e.,
the pressure
which would
be indicated
by a pressure gauge
moving
with the current
and not subject
to impact.
To avoidthe
influence
of impact,
the static
opening
points
at right angles to the dynamic
opening.
If the two openings
are connected
to the two sides of a
differential
pressure
gauge, the gauge shows a head which depends
on

and

It' the fluid is a liquid

the gauge shows a head h and the

According
to the elementary
theory

C should
be

it is in fact" in the neighborhood
of unity,
when _the instrument
is properly
designed

precautions.

it may be said that

These
assumptions
are never
exactly
fulfilled
in ordinary
practice
and accordingly found with results instrum(ntnot be obtaimd,
exact
may
even when no
fault is to be
the
itself.
In the first place, it is impossible
to read the gauge instantaneously;
furthermore,
there
is always
a tune la_, between
the openings
and
the gauge.
Accordingly,
even when the current
does not change
in
direction,
if its speed varies rapidly
all that can be observed
is the
mean value of t_ over a certain
time interval,
and this value does not
correspond
to the arithmetical
mean value of S over the same interval, even if the interval
is lone compared
with the time lag, as has
bec'n shown
experimentally
bv_i_{ateau. _
Disregarding
the time lag, the value of S computed
by equation
(3)
will be the root-mean-square
speed, which is aIways larger
than the
arithmetical
mean speed.
Hence
if, for example,
the Pitot
tube is
being used to detm-mine
the discharge
through
a steam
main feeding
a reciprocating
engine,
the computed
discharge
will be greater
tha_
the true discharge.
This error is not likely to be very large.
If, for
'ustanee,
the speed varies sinusoi(lally
witt{ time from'0.5
to l.o times
ts arilhmetical
mean value, the linear speed computed
by equation
(3) will t)e 1.0607
times the arithmetical
mean speed wilieh
doto:'minas the total flow, or a trifle over 6 per cent. too large.
A sec._m,! cause of error is rapid variability
in direction
of the current,
w),.ieh makes
it impossible
to keep tl{o tube pointed
correctly
even when mount('d
on a vane.

the case, it is de•

are small,
the error is _dne almost
en-

tir.e,}v to the cff('et on the static
opening
and not to change
of the
dir( etion of impact
on the dynamic
opening?
This source of error is much reduced
in _thc Dines tube, a foizn of
Pit(_t tube in which the static
opening
centrists of a number
of round
holes or longitudinal
slits in a-hollow
cylinder
placed
with its axis
perpendicular
to the direction
of the impaet
tube and to the plane
in which the variations
of direction
are expected
to occur.
When
this instrument
is employed
a_ an anemometer,
its principal
use, the
cylinder
is of course v-er(_eal.
The heads
given by the Dine:_ tube are sensibly
independent
of
errors

ing through
a quiescent
medium,
as with a whirling
arm in air, may
not give correct
results
when used to determine
the velocity
of a
fluid past a fLxed point.
It is difficult
to see how the Pitot tube can
respond
to anything
but velocity
relative
to itself.
At all events,
ex.periments
by Fry. and Tvndall_ ' have shown
that while, there was
some
apparent
dlsa_oTeement
at speeds
below
11 miles per hour
(17.7
kilometers)
"_;_ere the exl_erimental
errors
were
large,
for
higher speeds,
up to 36 miles pernour
(58 kilometers)
both methods
of standardization
gave the same result.
_Vhich method
of standardization
should
be adopted--motion
of
tile tube or motion
of the fluid--may,
nevertheless,
depend
on the
purpose
for which the instrument
is intended.
It is impossible
in
practice
to set up an artificial
current
of fluid which shall have a high
speed and not be turbulent
and full of eddies;
and the only conditions
to which equations
(1) and (2) refer are, in strictness,
th_{se of steady
stream-line
flow or steady
motion
of the tube in a quiescent
fluid.
If

ft

.D ;_e5

a.et.o_.re_er.

the tube is to be used in averv
turbulent
medium,
as, for example,
in
measuring
the discharge
from" a fan, it should
be standardized
in a
stream
of fluid in which the turbulence
is about
the same as it will
be under the working
conditions.
It might
very well happen
that a
given tube when tested
on the whirling
arm or by moving
through
still water
gave a coefficient
C= 1, while if the tube were tested in a
turbulent
current
some other value of C was obtained.
If the tube
were to be used to measure
the average
speed of a similarly
turbulent
current,
this second coefficient
should be used and not the value C= 1.
Apparent
errors
arid inconsistencies
in the results
obtained
bv
equations
(1) and (2) have probably
been due in part to disregardin_g
the foregoing
obvious
consMerations.

GENERAL

REMARKS

ON

RESISTANCE

ANEMOMETERS.

When a fixed obstruction
is placed
in a current
of fluid, it experiences a force in the direction
of tlow which d,,pen, ts upon and may be
used a._ a measure
of the speed of the current.
The force depends
ca
the :',,l:_ive
mo_iml and is the same, at the same relative
speed, when
the tluid is at rest and the body
moves
thr(,u_h
it, the force then
appearing
as a resistance
to the x}mtion.
It is hie rcsMtant
of forces
exerted
on the el(,ments
of the surface
of the b,dv

by skin

fluid

moving

85

along

the

surface.

Since

we are

now interested
only in devices
wh}_h l_,_ay be used as anemometers,
we may as well, for the future, say ' air ' instead
of fluid, and "wind"
instead
of current.
As regards
the pressure,
there
is always,
on the windward
or
upstream
side, a region of increased
pressure,
i. e., of excess above the
general
static pressure
of tile air; while on the leeward
or do_mstream
side there is a defi_iiency.
In the Pitot tube, the obstruction
coizsists
of the impact
tub(, with its open mouth
at the upstream
end.
This
receives
the excess
pressure
and transmits
it to the gauge.
The
instrument
deals solely with the excess
pressure
on the upstream
side, of an obstruction
of particularly
simple
form, the drag due to
skin friction
and the suction
on the downstream
side having
no
effect on the reading
of what we have called a perfect Pitot tube.
The next simplest
case is that of a thin flat plate of regular
outline
set. normal
to the wind.
_Ihe skin friction
forces balance
one another
and the whole normal
force on the plate is the surface integral
of the
excess of pressure
on tile front, over that on the back.
If the plate
is mounted
so th._t the f_)ree of the wind on it can be measured,
it
constitutes
a "pressure-I)late
anemon_eter."
Various
devices
which
are in practical
use may
be regarded
as
intermediate
between
tile Pitot tube and the pressure
plate anemometer.
Among
these are the Dines tube (see p. 82), the "Stauscheibc,"
and the Pneumometer.
The Stauscheibe
is a metal
disk about
1
cm. in diameter
with holes in the centers
of its two faces from which
the pressures
are led to the two arms of the U gauge, through
the disk
and through
the support
by which the disk is held prependieular
to
the current.
'lhe Pneumometer
differs
from the Stauscheibe
only
in details
of construction.
For both these
instruments
the coefficient
of equation
(1) has the value
0.854,
the observed
pressure
difference
being influenced
by the suction
at the downstream
face as
well as by the impact
pressure
on the upstream
face?
In the case of pressure
plate anemometers,
it is usually
the total
force acting on the ohstruction
in the wind that is measured,
rather
than
a manometric
pressure,
although
Stanton
2 used a diaphragm
and air pressure
to transmit
the force acting on a plate to a manometer
50 feet away.
If the sohd obstruction
is anything
else than a thin flat plate normal
to the wind, skin friction
as well as pressure
contributes
to the resultant force;
and if the body is not symmetrical
about an axis parallel
to
the wind,
the resultant
force will not in general
be parallel
to the
wind, but the body will receive a side thrust
in addition
to tile resistance in the direction
of the wind, as, for example,
when the wing of an
aeroplane
has both lift and drift.
Any body mounted
so that the
force on it can be measured,
provides
a means of measuring
the speed
of the wind and may be used as an anemometer;
but if the body is
to be held in a fixed orientation
with respect
to the wind, it is evidently
simplest,
mechanically,
to avoid
side thrust
by making
the
body symmetrical
about
the wind
direction,preferably
a figure of
revolutmn
about
that axis.
The resistance
offered to the wind by a
symmetrical
body
of given maximum
section
normal
to the wind

depends
greatly
on its shape,
being less for a sphere
than for a flat
plate normal
to the wind,
and still less for a somewhat
elongated
spindle-shaped
body.
Whatever
the shape of the body may be, unless it is a sphere
its
resistance
to a given wind depeuds
on its presentation,
and by a
suitable
choice of shape this variation
of the force with the orientation may be made quite large.
The operation
of the Robinson,
or
cup anemometer,
depends
on the fact that
tile resistance
of a hemispherical
cup is greatest
whcu the concave
side is pointed
to windward,
so that
a wind blowing
in the plane of rotation
of the cups
always
produces
a torque.
In the so-called
bridled
form of this
anemometer,
the torque
is measured
statically
and the instrument
is
then merely a rather
complicated
form of pressure-plate
anemometer.
In tile ordimLry form of the instrument,
in which the cups are allowed
to revolv(_ freely,
the speed of the wind is measured
indirectly
by
observing
the speed of rotation,
the action
of the wind on the cups
being theu still more complicated•
From
the fact
that
the r)ressure
recorded
by the Pitot
tube
is
proportional
to the square
o'f the speed,
it mig[Lt be surmised
that
the total force observed
with a pressure-plate
or other static resistance
anemometer
would probably
also be nearly proportional
to the square
of the speed;
and this is confirmed
by experiment.
The analogy
between
these anemometers
and the P_tot_ tube is a very close one,
the Pitot
tube being in principle
only a particularly
simple kind of
resistance
anemometer.
We have next to speak somewhat
more in detail
of some special
types of resistance
anemometer.

_ he coefficient

is approximately
proportional
t.o the density

with the size and shape of the plate.
The independence
of Pitot tube
readings
of the size and nature
of the dynamic
opening
would
lead
us to expect
that
the pressure
at the center of the front of the plate
would be independent
of the size and shape of the plate, and Stanton's
_
experiments
confirm
this expectation.
But the suction
on the back
depends
on size as well as speed, thus accounting
for the variability
of K and showing
that P is only a fictitious
pressure
with no physical
significance.

A. Square plates.--According
to Eiffel _ the value of the coefficient
K of equation
(7) in English
units varies from 0.00266
for plates
4

square
to K=0.00326
for plates

or larger.
The temperature
and pressure
of the air (luring

The correspon(Iing

values
are 0.065 and 0.08.

F is the total force in pounds,
S is the speed in feet per

The equation
refers to air

If S is measured

becomes

it may be written

B. Circular
disks.--For
a circular
disk 30 centimeters,
or 11.8
inches, in diameter,
Eiffel gives the value
K=0.00276
English,
or
0.0675 metric.
Stanton
_ found the values
K= 0.0027 English
(0.066
metric)
by using a 2-inch
disk.
On the whole,
Eiffel's
results
seem
preferable,
because
the size of disk used by him is more nearly
the
desirable
size for an anemometer.
As regards
the relative
importance
of the front
and back of the
plate,
it ma) be noted that in a wind of 10 meters per second or 22.4
miles per hour, Eiffel found that the front of his 12-inch disk accounted
for 72 per cent of the whole resistance.
Zahm * has pointed
out that
if a plate be surrounded
by a sufficiently
broad guard ring there will
be no suction
on the back, while the p_essure
on the front
will be
uniform

AND

HEMISPHERES.

Next to thin plates
and hemispherical
cups the sphere
has been
most frequently
employed
in static
resistance
anemometers
as the
obstruction
opposedto
the wind.
In addition
to the fact that
a
sphere
is symmetrical
about
all diameters,
so that
the indications
of a sphere
anemometer
may be made independent
of changes
in
wind direction,
the sphere
has the further
advantage
of simplicity
of form so that it may readily
be duplicated.
A disadvantage
of the
sphere,
as compared
with thin plates,
is the lower value of the coefficient K of equation
(7).
According
to W. H. Dines,
as quoted
by Lanchester,
1 K has a
value of 0.00154
English
for a sphere
6 inches in diameter,
or 0.0378
metric
for one 153 millimeters
in diameter.
Dines's
tests were
made with a velocity
of 21 miles an hour
(34 kilometers).
Eiffel 2
ves K as 0.00045
(0.011 metric)
and explains
the difference
between
s value and that
of 0.00112
(0.0275
metric)
found
at Gettingen,
as follows:
K decreases
with an increase
of velocity
until a certain
critical
velocity
is reached,
after which
K remains
nearly
constant
at 0.00045
for the thre_, spheres
experimented
upon.
This critical
velocity
was found to be about 27 miles an hour for a 6-inch sphere,
16 miles for a 10-inch
sphere,
and 9 miles for a 13-inch sphere

7, and 4 meters per second, respectively,
for the 16, 24, and 33 centimeter
spheres).
The high value
of the GSttingen
coefficient
is,
according
to Eiffel, due to the fact that velocities
of over 23 miles
an hour
(36 kilometers)
can not be obtained
at that
laboratory.
It will be noted that even for a 6-inch sphere
the critical
velocity
is
well below the lowest
flying speeds
used in practice.

It appears that with a cup there would he little if any reduction

with a plate giving an equal force, though
the cup
would have the advantage
of greater

for a given force and

The difference
in the force acting
on the cup in its two

which
is the driving
force of the Robinson
anemometer,
is clearly

PRACTICAL

FORMS

OF

RESISTANCE

ANEMOMETER.

Maxim'
used
a pressureplate
anemometer
consisting
of a disk
with a spring
resistance.
His arrangement
had the advantage
of
fairly urn'form
graduations
of the scale, the spring
acting indirectly,
with variable
leverage
on the pressure
plate.
In the pressure-plate
anemometer
of Dines 2 the variable
resistance
is furnished
by a float partly
immersed
in water,
the pressure
on the
plate being equal to the weight
of a volume
of water
equal to that
of the part of the float raised above the water level.
The
1914
catalogue
of Aera,
Paris,
shows
a pressure
plate
anemometer
which is merely
a speed indicator.
It is supplied
with
three disks, so that it may be set for any speed between
50 and 75
miles an hour (80 and 120 kilometers).
The pointer
will then show
whether
the actual
speed is above or below the normal.
Aera also
make
an anemometer
using a sphere,
in the form of a pendulum.
This instrument
reads onl_ to 45 milesan
hour (72 kilometers)
and
has _oTaduations
coming
closer together
at higher
speeds.
It would
be very inaccurate
without
some means for holding
it vertical.

THE

ANEMO-TACHOMETER.

When anemometers
of the screw type are used for high velocities,
there
is danger
that
the vanes will be deformed
and the velocity
indications
become
um.?liable,
and for this reason
cup anemometers
are more
suitable
for out-door
work.
Wilhehn
l_Iorell, of Leipzig,
has placed
on the market
an anemo-tachometer
illustrated
in the
Deutsche
Luftfahrer2
This is a Robinson
anemometer
with tachometer
attached
for aeronautical
purposes,
the tachometer
being
an
instrument,
usually
actuated
by centrifugal
force like a steam
engine flyball
governor,
so that "velocities
may be read
at a glance
from the position
of a pointer.
It will be noted
that with a tachometer, in contrast,
to a revolution
counter,
no measurement
of a time
interval
is required.
The anemo-tachometer
also has the advantage
of all Robinson
anemometers
that
the wind vane may be dispensed
with.
According
to a communication
from Morell, his anemometers
are
calibrated
m a wind
tunnel,
built
in accordance
with designs
of
Prof. Pramltl
of the University
of GSttingen,
in which
air currents
up to 78 miles per hour
(125 kilometers),
can be obtained.
It is
stated
that some of these instruments
have been in constant
use for
two years without
needing
recalibration.
The anemo-tachometer,
as well as other anemometers,
should
be
attached
to the aeroplane
in such a manner
that its indications
are
not influenced
by the irregular
and indeterminate
wash
of the
machine
and proI_eller.
It has been proposed
to lengthen
the distance between
the cups and the casing, so as to brhzg
the cups above
the upper
supporting
plane_, while keeping
the dial on a level with
the pilots
line of vision.
'Ihe objection
to this lengthening
is that
it might
change
the friction
and hence the indications
of the instrumerit, and necessitate
a special calibration.
What appears
at first sight to be a solution
of the difficulty,
would
be to prowde
the anemometer
axis with a small electric
generator,
and use the electric
voltage,
thus
generated
to indicate
speed
of
rotation
by means of a voltmeter.
We should
anticipate,
however,
that
elect'tic
indicathlg
instruments,
as at present
constructed,
would not long retain
their accuracy
when exposed
to the vibrations
on an aeroplane.

THE

BOURDON-VENTURI

91

ANEMOMETER.

The Venturi tube consists of a short converging
inlet followed by
a long diverging cone, the entrance and exit diameters bein_ usually
e(_ual so t} at the tube may be inserted as a section of a pipe line.
Tncre is generally a short cylindrical
throat.
The converging
part
has sonlewhat the shape of arena
contracta, but its exact (orm is of
littm importance.
'l_e exit cone has a total angle of about 5 °, this
beit_g f()u,_d to give the mininmm frictional loss for a given increase
of diameter.

When a current of fluid passes through the tube, the pressure in
the throat is less than at entrance
to the converging
inlet, by an
amount which depends on the ratio of entrance
to throat area, the
density of the fluid, and the speed of flow. If the tube is provided
with side holes and connections to a differential gauge by which this
p,_essure difference may be observed, it constitutes
a Venturi meter.
1he area ratio is a known constant for a given tube, so that when the
density of the fluid is known the observed pressure difference may be
used as a measure of the speed of flow. When the pressure difference
is expressed as the height of a water column, it is known technically
as the "head on Venturi."
Such an instrument
may be used as an anemometer
by pointing
it so that the wind blows directly through it, and the observed hea_
may then serve as a measure of the wind speed.
Bourdon ' emoloved
the Venturi tube for this purpose in 1881, and it has been used r_en_tly
as an aeroplane anemometer.
At a given speed, the observed head increases with the ratio a of
entrance to throat area and the instrument
may be made to give a
much larger head than a Pitot tube.
This is illustrated by the figures
given in Table 5 for a tube in which a =4, the throat having half the
diameter
of the entrance.
The data are for air at atmospheric
pressure and 70 ° F. Column (2) gives the head which would be observed
with a Pitot tube; column (3) that observed by Bourdon;
and column
(4) the ratio of (3) to (2).

In figure 1 the line H G represents
Bourdon's
observations
and the
starred
values in column
(3) of Table 5 were read from the dotted
extension
of this curve.
While this extrapolation
can make no claim
to accuracy,
it appears
from column
(4) of Table 5 that
a Venturi
tube with a 2 to 1 diameter
ratio would probably
give at least'five
times as much head as a Pitot
tube at ordinary
aeroplane
speeds.
The curve F E of figure 1 and the numbers
in column
(5) of Table
5 were found
from equation
(27) of Part 2, which is known
exI_'rimentally
to agree closely
with the facts when the Yenturi
meter
is inserted
in a pipe line instead
of being used as an anemometer
with
both ends free.
Upon
introducing
the known
values of k and p for
air at one atmosphere
and 70 ° F., equation
(27) reduces
to
/_o
S=

1720_/r7_(1

-- 7)
_2 _

miles

per hour.

r7

If the 1720 is replaced
by 769, the result will be in meters
per second.
What
part of the great discrepancy
between
columns
(3) and (5)
of Table 5, or between/_
F and G H of figure 1, is to be ascribed
to
friction
or other circumstances
which make the Venturi
tube act differently
as an anemometer
and as a flow meter,
and what part
to
Bourdon's
experimental
arrangements
and possible errors of observation, can not-be
decided
without
further
investigation;
but in any
event, it is obvious
that with the Venturi
tube a much larger head is
available
than with a Pitot tube.
Since Bourdon
wanted
an anemometer
for very low speeds,
he
increased
the available
head still farther
by using
two concentric
tubes,
the exit end of the inner one being at the throat
of the outer,
so that the suction
there increased
the speed through
the inner tube
and the fall of pressure
at its throat.
The proportions
of the tubes
which
were adopted
as giving
the best results
were as shown
in
Table 6.

No cylindrical

cones being connected
directly.
Bour(|on
also used a similar arrangement
of three concentric
tubes.

with this, at various

are shown oil

The proportions
of single-tube
anemometers
as used in modern
French
practice
seem to tie somewhat
like those of Bourdon's
inner
tube.
(See Table 6.)
The length
of tul)e in the anemometer
made
by Aera, of Paris,
is 6.3 inches
(160 ram.) or nearly
the same as the
length
of the diverging
cone of Bourdon's
immr tube.

a s,,ction

The

proposed
by Toussaint
and Lcpt_re 3 as a result of recent

B. Robustness.--The
very severe
conditions
of vibration
preclude
the possibility
of using
instrmnents
which
are not m(chanically
strong
or which can not be made so without
too great weight.
Both
the anemometer
head proper,
and the tn_nsmitting
and b_dicating
parts must be simple, light, strong,
and fre( from the need of delicate
adjustment
or frequent
testing.
C. Position.--The
head must, so far as practicable,
be out of reach
of irregular
currents
and eddies and therefore
at some distance
from
the indicator
or dial in front of the pilot.
The available
positions
are (a) in front of the center of the machine,
(b) well above the upper
planes
over the pilot's
head,
(c) near one wing tip.
Posit}on
(a)
might
be practicable
and satisfactory
in some cases t)ut th(re is a
possibility,
unless
the head were very far in front,
that the readings
might not he the same, at a given speed, during normal
flighI_ as when
planing
with the motor stopped.
We have no information
o_ this
point.
The influence
of the body extends

what is needed in aviation
is primarily
the relative
wind speed along a
direction
fixed with re_ard
{o the axis of the machine.
The undesirable
complication
otmounting
the anemometer
head on a wind
vane is therefore
unnecessary
and the head may be fixed.
If information is required
about
motion
perpendicular
to this direction,
it may
begot
from a wind vane.
E. Independence
of gravity.--On
account
of the very considerable
angles of heeling and pitching,
it seems useless to consi(ter
any instrument which depends
for its action
on weights
or liquid man'0meters.
Any required
forces must be applied by springs;
or l_fpressures
are to
be registered,
it must be by spring
gauges.
Furthermore,
all parts of
the hastrument
must be so balanced
that the readings
are not affected
at all by gravit) ". This remark
applies
to the transmission
and the
indicator
as well as to th( head.
F. Vertical acceleration
and centrifugal
force.--Vertical
acceleration
acts merely as a change of the intensity
of gravity.
It will, therefore,
have no effect on an instrument
which
is properly
constructed
in
accordance
with E, above.
Centrifugal
force must be allowed
for in a similar
way by careful
balancing
of all movable
parts so that the lateral
acceleration
of the
whole machine
during
curved
flight shall not influence
the readings.
This balancing
in the transmission
is equally
necessary,
whether
forces are transmitted
by rods or wires or pressures
by fluids in tubes.'

DENSITY

CORRECTIONS.

Before
considering
the effects
of changes
of air densit):
on the
indications
of particular
types
of anemometer
it will be _:cll to see
how great these variations
are likely to be under working
conditions.
For this purpose
we consult

the relative

(H = 1.0 for saturated

The ranges
we shall assume
are: B=30

to a rise from sea level to about
10,000
feet altitude;
t=0 ° to 90 _
F.; H=0.0
to 1.0, i. e., from complete

We may first consider
the term
0.376 PH.

if we assume
a constant

H= 0.5, while in fact
the humidity

we can make in the value of 0.376 PH is 0.376 P>,'0.5, of which the

To find the pcrceutage

these errors witlt the value of E.
The following table shows the maxinmm

If the purpose
of reading
the anemometer
is not, primarily,
to
ascertain
the speed, but to judge of the wind pressures
on the machine
which determine
the lift and the stresses,
then the density
correction
should
not be applied.
For at any given angle of attack,
the wind
forces are very nearly
proportional
to the Pitot pressure;
when the
gauge
shows
a given reading,
the wind
forces are always the same;
and from
the standpoint
of sustaining
power
and strength
it is
immaterial
how the forces arise.
Hence

speed
readings
of the Pitot-tube
anemometer
correct
themselves
automatically--if
the machine
flies safely at a given
speed and in
air of a given density,
it will be equ%lly safe in air of any other density, regardless
of pressure,
tem])erature,
and humidity
if the Pitottube gauge gives the same reading.
B. Pres,_ure-plate
ane_ometers'.--It
would
naturally
be supposed
that
the readings
of pressure
plate
anemometers
wouhl
be affected
by variations
of air densit 5 in the same way as those of Pitot tubes.
The theory
of the subject,
however,
is not entirely
clear, and it is
difficult
to interpret
some of the experimental
results
which
have
been obtained?
In the absence
of _further
investigation
it. would
seem safest to make the density
correction,
when necessary,
exactly
as is done for the Pitot tube.
:if the readings
are taken o_1_" for th-c
sake of estimating
the wind forces on the machine,
the del;sity
correction
is to be omitted,
just as with the Pitot tube.
C. The Bourdon-Ventur_
ant.nwmcter.--If
the results
of Bourdon's
experiments
agreed
closely
with computations
from the theoretical
equation
of the Venturi
meter, we shouhl
feel justified
in using that
equation
to compute
density
corrections
to be applied
to the readings of an instrament
which had been tested at a standard
air density.
But the discrepancies
sho_n
by curves
GH and EF of figure 1 are
so large
that
we can not trust
the theoretical
equation
at all for a
Venturi
tube
used
as an anemometer.
It appeal_s
that
further
experimental
investigations
of this instrument
are needed.

It seems likely, however,
that
this independence

The ratio of cup or vane speed to wind
speed depends
on the value of the least wmd speed which will just
keep the anemometer
turning
against
friction.
And since each vane
or cup when moving
very slowly acts as a pressure
plate,
it seems
that the wind speed required
in order to furnish
the torque
for very
low speeds
of rotation
must
depend
on the air density:
Hence
it
seems probable
that at higher speeds the action of instruments
of the
Robinson
or of the screw type is somewhat
influenced
by air density.
Exact
information
on this is lacking.

COMPARISON

OF

TYPES

OF

ANEMOMETER.

Anemometers
in general
might
be compared
from various
po'mts
of view;
but since our purpose
is strictly
practical,
we shall at once
exclude
from the discussion
any instrument
which can not be made
satisfactory
on the score of (a) robustness
combined
with lightness,
(b) independence
of gravity,
and (c) flexibility
of transmission,
permitting
the head
to be placed
at a distance
from the indicator
in
front of the pilot's
seat.
There seem then to remain
for discussion
the Pitot tube, the pressure
plate, the Venturi
tube, and the Robinson
anemometer.
A. The Pitot tube.--This
has been the most studied,
and we can
speak
of it with more certainty
than
of the others.
The head is

simple and may be placed in any position; and the transmission
of
the-pressure
through
tubes presents
no obvious difficulties.
The
prime defect of the instrument
is the smallness of the pressure available for actuating
the indicator.
_31ile sensitive liquid ganges may
be used under some circumstances,
anything but a spring gauge seems
•
S
"
"
out of the questton for all-round u_e. •the problem with the Pltot
tube is to make a satisfactory
spring gauge which shall at the same
time be sufficiently sensitive and so robust as to be reliable.
The
problem looks difficult, but nmy not be insoluble.
B; The pressure 1,1ate.--Bv an increase of size, the pressure plate
ma_ be made to give as laruo a force as is desired, the _nit being set
by "the amount of head resl_tance which it is considered permissible
to devote to an anemometer.
Transmission
by wires under tension
mizht be practicable
but would be liable to get out of order and to be
serl_ously disturbed
by vibration.
Transmission
by means of liquid
pressure might bc managed but wouht introduce complications,
and
the development
of the instrument
in this form would demand a
great deal of experimentation.
In spite of its attractiveness
and
apparent
simplicity at first sight, the pressure plate does not, on the
w_h-ole,seem very promising as a practical aeroplane instrument.
C. The Bourdon-Ventu_4_ anemo'meter.--The
Venturi tube furnishes
a pressure difference and the transmission
problem is simple, as it is
whh the Pitot tube.
But the pressure difference may lie made so
large that the problem of making, a satisfactory
spring gauge is vastly
simpler than With the Pitot tube, and shouldnot
present any insuperable difficulties.
A more important
doubt arises in colmection
with the density correction.
Since it is impracticable
to test. an
anemometer
at low-air densities by the ordinary methods, and since
Bourdon's
results differed greatly from what might have been expected on theoretical
grounds, the instrument
should be used with
caution, if high altitude flights are in question, until we kno,_ more
about its practical behavior.
On the other hand, it appears to be
satisfactory
at ordinary air densities, _ and it seems to lie an instrument of great promise and one of which the practical development
should be pushed along.
D. The Robinson anemameter.--The
weak point of the Robinson
anemometer
is lack of flexibility in the transmission.
In the form
of Morell's anemo-tachometer
it indicates speed through the air nearly
independently
of the air density.
But gmce the main purpose of
knowing this speed is for finding the total distance traveled, it would
seem as if the ordinary
method of registering
the total number of
turns wouhl, in. practice, be more useful than the attachment
of a
tachometer
to give instantaneous
speeds.
tIaving now disclLssed some of the mechanical
characteristics
of
the four types of instrument
we may take another standpoint
and,
assuming that a mechanically
satisfactory
instrument
of each type
can be constructed,
ask whether one presents any advantages
over
another.
The answer to this question depends on why we want to
know the speed.
If what is wanted is to estimate the distance traveled through the
air, some form of Robinson anemometer
seems to be the thing to use,
because it is independent
of air density, to a first approximation,
at

"all events.
The other
t}u'ce types
of i_lstvuinent
will all require
to
have a density
correction
apt)lied to their readings,
if the air density
is f_r different
from that during
standardization,
and they are thus
at _ disadvantage.
But it appeai_s that
the speed tln.ough
the air is, in general,
not
itself the important
quantity
sought;
for at best it does not tell us
the speed over the ground
t_ntil it is compounded
with the speed of
the wind which may happen'" to be blowing.
A more important
use
of the anemometer'is
not properly
as a speedometer
but as a dynamometer,
i. e., as an h_strument
for indicating
the air forces on the
machine.
For this purpose,
any instrume_tt
such
as the anemotachometer
which gives the speed without
reference
to the density
will require
a density
correction
to its readings,
whereas
the Pitot
tub_ gives just
what
is wanted,
the allowance
for density
being
already
present
in its uncorrected
mean equal pressures,
whatever

the

readings,
density

so that
equal
may be. The

readings
pressure

ph_te f_lls in the same class as the Pitot
tube.
Of the BourdonVe_turi
anemometer
we can say very little until the hlstrument
has
been further
studied,
but it seems l_kely that it _so will act rather
as a dynamometer
than as a speedometer,
if its readings
are not corrected
for variations
of air density.
Still another
question
which may be asked is, What
sort of mean
speed
does a given anemometer
indicate
when exposed
to a gusty
wind ? In regard
to this question,
the four types under
consideration fall into the same grouping
as before.
With the Pitot tube, the
pressure
plate,
or the Ventur[tube,
the pressure
difference
or the
force depends
on the square
of the wind speed, and the mean reading
of any of these instruments
in a wind of varying
speed will therefore
give not the arithmetical
mean speed but the root-mean-square
speed,
which
is what
determines
the mean wind forces
on the aeroplane.
The anemo-tachometer,
on the other hand,
will probably
in_ticato
something
between
the arithmetical
mean and the root-mean-square
speed.
If it had no inertia
it might
be made to indicate
the arithmetical
mean, but the effects of inertia
in causing
lag or lead will
probably
make
the mean reading
of the instrument
in a wind
of
variable
strength
somewhat
higher
than it would be in the absence
of inertia.
The fact that
this might
result
in a slight
overestimate
of the total travel will hardly
be of any moment,
in vmw of the imt_ossibility,
for the aviator,
of measuring
and allowhlg
for the true veracity of the wind with respect
to the earth's
surface.

THE THEORY

OF THE PITOT AND VENTURI

TUBES.

By E. _UCKINGHAM.

1. THE

ENERGY

EQUATION

FOR

STEADY

ADIABATIC

FLOW

OF A FLUID.

Let a fluid be flowing steadil_ _ along a channel with impervious and
nonconducting
walls, from a section A to a section A1, the areas of the
sections perpendicular
to the direction of flow being also denoted by
A and A1. By saying that the flow is "steady"
we do not mean that
it occurs in stream lines and without turbulence.
We mean merely
that it is "sensiblv"
steady;
i. e., that such variations
of speed,
direction of motio_i', pressure, etc., as may occur at anv point in the
stream as a result of turbulence are so rapid that our me_.suring instruments do not respond to them, but indicate only time averages;
and
that these time averages are constant at any fixed point within the
channel.
Values of a property of the fluid, or of an_ other quantity
such as speed, "at a point," are therefore to be un[lerstood
as time
averages over a time which is lonz compared _ ith the sDeed of variation of the quantity to be measured,
though it may ap'pear short in
the ordinary sense.
Let O, p, v, _, T, respectively,
be the absolute
temperature,
static
pressure,
specific
volume,
internal
energy
per
unit
mass, aml kinetic
energy
per un{t mass, at the entrance
section A.
By the "static pressure"
is meant the pressure which would
be indicated by a gauge moving with the current.
Let O, p, v, _,
T_ be the correst_onding quantities
at the exit section A,
Both sets
o_ values are to _e understood
as averazes over the whole section, as
well as time averages in the sense exp3ained above.
The two sections shall be at the same level, so that the passage of fluid from A
to A_ does not involve any gravitational
work.
As a unit mass of fluid crosses A, the work pv is done on it by the
fluid following; and as it crosses A_ it does th_work p_vl on the fluid
ahead.
Since the walls of the channel are noncomtucting,
no heat
enters or leavens the fluid between A and A_ ; hence the total energy,
internal phls kinetic, increases (or decreases) by an amount equal to
the work done oa (or by) the fluid, and we have

to substitute
this expression

in equation.(1).
_[his substitution
is indis0cnsable
to further
progress,
but it involves
an assumption
which
desh'ovs
the rigor of all further
deductions.
The deductions
are, nevertheless,
very approximately
confirmed
by
experiment,
and it is therefore
worth
while to examine
the assumption.
If there
were no turbulence
and if the speed were uniform
over
each section,
we should have the two separate
equations

(3)

and equation
(2) would
be exact.
If there is no turbulence
but the
speed of flo_ is nonuniform,
approaching,,
zero at the walls, as it must
where the channel
has material
_ alls, equations
(3) will not be satisfied, but we shall
have T>½S:
and T_ >½St 2, because
the mean
square
speed, which determines
the kinetic
cnerg2", is always greater
than
the arithmetical
mean speed S when the distribution
over the
section
is not uniform.
With
a round
pipe and nonturbulent
flow
T= _S: instead
of _S 2.
In nearly
all practical
cases the flow of fluids is turhulent
and the
relation
of'the whole kinetic
energy,
including
that of the turbulence,
to the arithmetical
mean normal
component
of the speed at the given
section
will depend
on the amount
of turbulencc.
It is impossible
to say what the relation
will be further
than that
the kinetic
energy
of cd'dies and cross currents
tends
to increase
the error which would
be hlvolvcd
in assuming
equations
(3), while, on the other hand,
the
fact that with increasing
tul'bulence
the speed becomes
more nearly
uniform
over a cross sectio_l tends to decrease
the difference
between
the mean s.quare and the arithmetical
mean of the component
normal
to any section.

103

The assumption
involved in using equation (2) is not, however, so
violent as that which would be involved
in using equations
(3)
separately.
For equations
(3) are equivalent
to

T- ½S T_- ½S,2= 0
2=
whereas

equation

(2) is satisfied

if

T- ½S T,- ½S1

(4)

no matter what the value is. Equation
(4) and its equivalent
(2)
are satisfied if the error in assuming equations
(3) to hold is the
same at both sections without vazfishing or oven being small.
This
will occur if the kinetic energy of turbulence
is the same at both
sections and if also the speed distributions
over the two sections are
such that the arithmetical
mean normal speed is the same fraction
of the mean-square
normal speed at both.
While therefore
it is
evident that the use of equations
(3) separately
might lead to conclusions at variance
with facts, equation
(2) may nevertheless
be
nearly fulfilled in practice.
The _greement
with observation
of
deductions
from equations
(2) and (1) shows that in many ordinary
cases the error committed
by treating
equation
(2) as exact is in
reality quite insignificant.
For geometrically
similar channels, the percentage error of equation

fluid and D a linear dimension of the channel.

At a given mean axial speed g we must therefore be prepared to find greater discrepancies
between experiment
and results
deduced
from equation
(2) for large channels
and fluids of low
kinematic
viscosity than for the opposite conditions.
We shall now proceed as if equation (2) were rigorously exact, and
by combining it with equation (1) we obtain

½(S' - S, _)= (_, + p,v,) - (_+ pv)

(5)

an equation which serves as the point of departure
for the theory of
the Pitot tube, the Venturi meter, the steam-turbine
nozzle, and
various other devices in which a stream of fluid is retarded or accelerated adiabatically.

degree

permitted

which have
been discussed
above.
A process
sore(what
of this nature
is pursued in the design
of steam-turbine

(¢+pv)
being then the
quantity
known
as the total heat of steam.
But when the fluid is a gas, it is usual to proceed
with deductions
from
equation
(5) by the aid of two further
assumptions
which
enable
us to compute
variations
of _ and v from observations
of p
alone.
The first of these assumptions
is that the fluid behaves
sensibly as an ideal gas defined
by the equations

of

gases,
such as air, carbon

are nearly
in confornfitv
with equations
(6) and
(7), and for such fluids no serious
error is involved
in making
the
assumption
mentioned,
unless very great
variations
of pressure
and
temperature
are under consideration.

also the relation

This
assumption
is, of
course, not exact,
for wliile we have stipulated
that the flow shall be
adiabatic,
the internal
heating,

causes
an increas(_
of entropy.
The assumption
amounts,
therefore,
to assuming
that

to cause an,)" sensible

equation

us to find the speed at the other

while equation

information
in terms of the pressures
at A and

and the ratio

We shall apply
this
equation
to both the Pitot tube and the Venturi
meter.
4. THE THEORY OF THE PITOT TUBE.

the fluid which is approaching
the dynamic
opening.

at a point so far upstream
that the
presence
of the Pitot tube proauces
no sensible
disturbance
there,
a
particle
of fluid approaches

slows down,
and
mixes
with the permanent
high-pressure
cap oi nearly
stationary
fluid, which
covers
the dynamic
opening
and communicates
with
the differential
gauge through
the impact
tube.
The same particle,
or another
indistinguishable
from
it, emerges
from
the cap and,
being
accelerated
by the now positive
pressure
gradient,
flows on
along
the impact
tube, finally
acquiring
a sensibly
constant
speed
•_hen
it has reached
a region
of sensibly
constant
pressure.
We
wish to apply
equation
(5) to this motion
if we can find a plausible
way of doing so.
Starting
with the contour
of a small plane area, in the undisturbed
current
and perpendicular
to its general
direction,
we construct,
in
ima_,ination,
a tubular
surface
of which the sides are at every point
para_Uel to the mean direction
of motion
of the fluid past that point,
as found
by. .averagin. g with regard
to time.
If. the motion.
{s not
turbulent,
this tube is a tube of flow and no fluid passes
in or out
through
its sides.
If the motion
is turbulent,
as it nearly
alwa_ s is
in practice,
the same fluid does not flow continuously
along the tube
as it would if the walls were impervious.
On the contrary,
particles
of fluid are continually
leaving
the tube in consequence
of the turbulent
time-changes
of the direction
of motion
at any fixed point;
and these particles
are continually
replaced
by others,
of the same
total mass, which enter from without
the tube.
But on the whole,
the particles
which enter have the same average
component
velocity
along
the tube as those
which leave;
for unless
this were true we
could,
merely by imagining
the tubular
surface,
generate
within
the
fluid a particular
filament
which
was moving,
on the whole,
faster
or slower
than
the surrounding
fluid.
We conclude
that
the net
effect of turbulence
is the same as if the imaginary
tube walls were
made rigid and perfectly
reflecting
for mechanical
impact
without
exerting
any skin friction
on the fluid flowing
along them.
If the whole current
of fluid is at a sensib]_
uniform
temperature
across
its general
direction,
no heat passes
m or out through
the
tubular
surface,
and equation
(5) may be applied
as though
we had
an impervious
nonconducting
channel
to deal with.
Furthermore,
if the tube is of small section,
the axial speed, averaged

the application equation(5),involvingtheassumptionf equation

Let us suppose,
for example,
that the Pitot tube is to bc used for
measuring
the speed of an aeroplane
and that an accuracy
of 0.5 per

Then we have A = 0.028 and p,-p=
0.028 p.

find what speed would
give this head on the differential

set p= 1 atmosphere=

Since an accuracy

it is evident
that
for all ordinary
speeds
of flight, no colTection
for compressibility
is needed
and equations
(13) and (14) may be used.
It is of course a simple matter
to compute
values of the correction

speeds;
but in view of the uncertainties
and
assumptions
involved
ill the theory,
the results
would have a misleading
appearance
of accuracy
and would

What
has been shown
is sufficient,
namely,
that if a Pitot tube does not measure
the speed of an aerot)lane
correctly the error is not due to neglecting

In d_)ing so, we shall let A be the entrance

Evidently,
the Venturi
pressure
difference
may easily be made much
larger
than
the Pitot pressure
difference
at the entrance
speed and
the gauge reading be made much more sensitive.
If the fluid is a gas instead
of a liquid,
compressibility
will still be
negligible
at sufficiently
low speeds,
as for the Pitot
tube, and equation (22) may be used;
but in general
the compressibility
must be
allowed
for.
To treat
the flow of a gas, we have to make the same
assumpUons
as in section
3, namely,
that
the gas is sensibly
ideal
and that
the flow from the entrance
section
A to the throat
AI is
sensibly
isentropic,
the combined
effect
of heat
conduction
to or
from the walls of the meter, and of internal
heating
in the gas itself,
being
insignificant.
We then have to apply
equation

case in hand,
and if for simplicity
we represent
the pressure

Figure 2.

The standard
terminal in Europe is shown in figure 2. This consists of an oval spring wire ferrule applied in almost the same manner
as the flat wire fen'Me in figure 1. Farticular
emphtsis is placed on
the method of forming ,the eye in the stay before applying the ferrule.
Radius of curve at "A ' and"B,"
figure 2, must be exactly the same
as radius at "C."
This is called a perfect eye.
No solder is used.
The ferrule is made of wire of the same raze as wire in stay and is
"spring"
quality.
Nine convolutions
constitute
the standard length
of terrule.
The hole in the ferrule is oval and a snug fit for the two
wires forming
the eye of stay.
Both wire and ferrule are tin
coated.
The free end of the wire is bent back over the ferrule and is
not fastened in any wa:_. This holds the ferrule firmly against the
shoulder at "A" and "B."
Tests made on stays having this type of terminal did not show
very satisfactory
results.
Eighty per cent of the tests showed an
efficiency of less than 65 per cent, the free end of the wire slipping
through the ferrule at failure of the stay.
In the remaining
20 per
cent of the tests the wire broke at "A," the stays having an average
efficiency of 68 per cent of the total strength of the wire.

Figure _.
In order to determine whether the direction of pitch of the spiral
spring ferrule had any influence in determining
the efficiency of the
stay, sample terminals
having left-hand ferrules as in figure 2 and
right-hand
ferrules as in figure 4 were made with a perfect eye in both
cases, tested, and compared.
The left-hand
fer,'ule clearly showed
an efficiency of about 5 per cent more than the right-hand
ferrule.
In testing the latter the free end of the wire slipped in every case.
Figure 5.
In figure 5 an effort was made so secure the free end of the wire
against slipping when strain was applied to the stay by wrapping
this end around the main stay wire.
Tests on this construction
showed an average efficiency of 72 per cent, fracture
taking place
at " B."
Figure 6.
Another
method of securing
the loose end consisted
of tying
the end down on the ferrule with fine annealed wire as shown in
figure 6. Tests made on this construction
showed an average efficiency of 70 per cent, fracture taking place at "A."
CONCLUSIONS

BASED

ON

ABOVE

TESTS.

Observations
made during tests of terminals 5 and 6 showed clearly
that the weak points of this construction
existed at "B" and "A,"
respectively,
and that it was necessary to increase the friction between
the walls of ferrule and the wire of the stay under strain to increase
efficiency.
Reliable information
at hand showed that the same con-

clusions
had been aimed at by foreign engineers
stationed
in America
and that they had solved
the problem
by soldering
the spring
ferrule
terminal
in the same manner
that Americans
had adopted
with the
flat wire terminal.
HORN'S

IMPROVED

TERMINAL

CONNECTION.

In an effort to avoid the use of solder with its many objectionable
features
types of construction
as shown
in figures 7 to 15, inclusive,
were originated
and tested.
In every
case the spring
ferrule
with
left-hand
pitch
was adopted.
The loose end of wire was secured
with a tie or simple wire loop or clip as shown.
Numerous
tests made
at intervals
throughout
the entire
series of tests with wires having
strengths
of 1,600, 1,800, and 2,300 pounds
showed
conclusively
that
there is no difference
in efficiency
of stays using wire of any of the
above strengths.
Figure 7.
Figure
7 shows a wedge between
the ferrule and free end of wire
so placed
that as strain

STAYS

FOR

AEROPLANES.

The ori__inal object
in the manufacture
of this material,
was the
securing
o[ the wire as strong
as possible in order to reduce the weight
as much as possible.
This resulted
eventually
in the manufactur_of
a_ wire so haul and strong
that difficulty
was experienced
in forming
the eye and bend over tile ferrule
w?thout
breaking
the wire.
The
result
of this was a lack of confidence
in high-strength
wire, and in
some cases the reaction
extended
to the use of a wire which
could
prope.rly
be classed as a soft wire•
The process of soldering
terminals
on wire stays
un<loubtedlv
helped
to a great extent
in buihling
up
this prejudice.
Nevertheless
it is still true, as at first, that a strong
wire which is serviceat)le
permits
the Dossibilitv
of reducine
weic, ht
and is therefore
desirable.
The great:number
%f tests on wire and
stays, which were necessary
to determine
the properties
of different
types
of terminals
as described
above, afforded
a ver_" excellent
opportunity
to note conclusively
the effect of usin_ various
gr,_des
and strengths
of wire•
We determined
that it was al_ importan_t
that
the wire should
be tough
and ductile
as well as strong.
All bends
shouhl
be made without
danger
of fracture.
In addition
to requirement
for tensile
strength,
we found
i_ necessary
to recommend
requirements
for torsion
and bend.
As the per cent efficiency
of the
stay due to loss of strength
at terminal
is as great with a strong
wire
as with a weaker
wire, as ,_ as clearly
demonstrated
in our tests, it
followed
conclusively
that as high a strength
as can be secured
commercially
under
the conditions
of torsion
and bend
test required
was desirable.
The following
specification
is therefore
recommended
as representing
suitable
high-grade
material
for the purpose.

etc., but we do not believe
that any of these
metals

practicable

"Maximum

appears
to be too all-important.
In none of these can

reliability

as with steel
when it is well protected
from mechanical
injury and corrosion.
For
exceptional
purposes,
the nonmagnetic
properties
of these
metals
may outweigh
their lack of strength
and durability
in fatigue,
making
their use imperative,
but in the final design
the amount
thus used
will undoubtedly
be the least possible
amount
permissible
under the
circumstances.
For constructxon
of this kind we would
not recommend,
without
many
qualifications,
a natural

This

appears
to possess
excellent

but
there appears
to be considerable
doubt
as to its absolute

only, are more "fool-proof" and consequently
morereliable and
desirable.
An attemptto give the elasticlimit andtensilestrengthof each
sizeof wire,strand,andcable
usedin aeroplaneonstruction, same
c
if

metalsmentionedabove,would
involvethe publicationof quitean extensive
report. Confining
ourselves th_ most suitable of these metals or alhiys, phosphor bronze,
to
aluminuln
bronze,
etc., it is a safe and reliable
rule to assume
that
the ultimate
strength
of such wire or cable or stay will be 50 per cent
of the ultimate
strength
of the extra high-strength
steel listed by us
for standard
aeroplane
use.
The elastic limit for nonferrous
me_tals
could not safely be assumed
at more than 50 per cent of the ultimate
breaking
strain.
The use of vanadium,
titanium,
ana other
special
deoxidizers
or
cleansers
in the manufacture
of steel has undoubtedly
resulted
in
very much improving
homogeneity
and density
of structure
in cast,
forged,
and other hot-worked
masses
of the metal
especially
in the
harder
alloyed
varieties.
It is not so certain,
however,
that the use
of these
metals
has proven
necessary
or even desirable
in making
steels of the higher grade
for wire manufacture
where the enormous
amount
of cold working
and exact heat treatment
absolutely
inherent
to the process
of wire manufacture
produces
eventually
a structure
finer and more homogeneous
than has ever been possible
by any
other
method.
The increased
resistance
to corrosion
which
the
special
steels, referred
to above, afford, because
of their density
and
uniformity,
is more than
duplicated
by any drawn
high-grade
wire
of the ordinary
carbon
steels of sufficient
degree of manufacture.
Vanadium
steels
and other steels
of their
kind have not as yet
become established
as desirable
wire steels.
Although
strongly
urged
upon
the industry
and tried time and again, they have not demonstrated
their superiority.
Carefully
made
high-grade
carbon
steel affords
to-day
the most
reliable
and flexible
material
for wire, cable,
and stays,
possessing
the "greatest
strength
for the least weight"
known
in the wire industry.
We know its advantages
and we know its disadvantages.
The
fact that the mechanical
properties
of steel wire and cable are seriously
affected
by corrosion
is so well known that it must be guarded
against.
As the damage
done is a function
of time as well as intensity
of chemical or electro-chemical
action
on the unprotected
steel,
we have
investigated
the question
of retarding
corrosion
in the steel itself to
as great a degree as possible.
We have found that pure iron retards
corrosion
to a greater
degree than the more impure steel--but
we have
also found
that in highly
extenuated
filaments
of these two metals,
as in wire, the difference
in rate of corrosion
is practically
negligible,
espccially
when the total life of the wire protected
by an external
coating
such as galvanizing
is taken
into consideration.
We have
found
the use of special
deoxidizers
and cleansers
questionable
and
have not adopted
them.
The use of protective
coatings
on steel wire or cable is a very broad
subject.
Hot galvanized
unwiped
wire is undoubtedly
the best protected
wire for the purpose.
Very hard wires and very fine sizes of
hard
wire are likely to become
brittle
at the temperature
of hot
galvanizing,
and the next
best coating
available
is, therefore,
a tin
coating.
_oth

o

As a protection
to the galvanizing, a coat of red-lead
paint should be applied
after the stay is assemble_! anti the red lead protected
by a coat. of graphite
pain't.
'lhe care with which inspections
are made from time to time and
the efficient maintenance
of the paint on the wires really ctetermines
the life of the combination.
This has been pr.ven
absoiutclv
by the
very extensive
use and treatment
of galvanized
steel on bo_mf ship
for many
years.
Nickel plating
is out of the question
for wires to be bent or twisted
into cable.
I_urthermore,
nickel
is absolutely
injurious
where
the
initial
purely chemical
action
on the intact
nickel surface
ceases and
electro-chemical
action between
steel, and nickel begins at such spots
when steel is exposed.
We believe,
therefore,
that tinning
and galvanizing
are to-day
the
most satisfactory
coatings
for steel wire that can be employed.

GENTLEMEN:
The particular
work comprising
the subject
of this
report
has been undertaken
pursuant
to an allotment
by Dr. Charles
D. Walcott,
Secretary
of the Smithsonian
Institution,
of $2,500, made
available
through
the Secretary
of Agriculture
to the Chief of the
Weather
Bureau.
At the meeting
of the executive
committee
held
June 11, 1915, the chairman,
Dr. Charles D. Walcott,
was authorized
to
designate
Charles F. Marvin, Chief of the Weather
Bureau,
as chairman
of a subcommittee
to investigate
and report
upon the problem
of the
atmosphere
in relation
to aeronautics.
He was requested
to select
other members
of the subcommittee,
not to exceed four, and Profs.
William
J. ttumphreys
and William
R. Blair,
of the United
States
Weather
Bureau,
subsequently
consented
to act as members
of the
subcommittee.
At the meeting
of the executive
committee
held August
5, 1915, a
proposal
of work to be undertaken
was outlined
by the chairman
of
the subcommittee
on the atmosphere
in relation
to aeronautics,
the
substance
of which is briefly quoted
as follows:
The Weather
t{ureau
is already
in possession
of an immense
amount
of data concerning atmospheric
conditions,
including
wind
movements
at the earth's
surface.
This
information
is no doubt
of distinct
value
to aeronautical
operations,
but
it needs
to
be collated
and put in form to meet
the requirements
of aviation.
The bureau
alse
has a considerable
amount
of determinations
of atmospheric
conditions
in the free air.
Most of these observations
were made
at Mount
Weather,
but others
have been made
at
a few points
in the West,
such as tIuron,
S. Dak. ; Fort Omaha,
Nebr.;
Avalon,
Cal. ;
and a few aboard
the ('east
Guard
cutter
Seneca,
during
the past summer
while
this
vessel
was engaged
on ice
patrol
off the ]_ewfoundland
coast.
Portions
of these
data
also are undoubtedly
valuable
to aviation,
but it is quite
apparent
that
but a
small fraction
of the material
needed
to meet
the requirements
of aeronautical
work
throughout
the United
States
is available,
and that
therefore
much additional
observation
_ ork is necessary.
In considering
the work that
should
be done along these
lines,
further
cooperation
is needed
by the Weather
Bureau
with those
actually
engaged
in aeronautical
operations,
and with
this need
in view
Prof.
Blair,
a member
of the subcommittee,
has
already
been
in conference
with
Mr. F. R. l_{cCmry,
acting
director
of naval
aeronautics.
It is proposed
to utilize
the fund made available
by the Smithsonian
Institution to undertake
a careful
compilation
of the data
already
available
in the Weather
Bureau
records,
this compilation
to be along lines that
will make

If one seeks to determine
the qualities
which offer the best chance
for improvement,
without knowing as yet the exact means for effecting
such improvement,
the procedure
is as follows:
Assume
that in a theoretically
perfect fabric each of the following
qualities
would be reduced to zero:
Weight
(per unit strength).
Diffusion.
Rate of depreciation
(dollars per year).
Heating
coefficient.
Interest
and insurance.
Moisture
absorption.
It may be admitted
that, in practice,
certain of the above qualities
can not possibly
be reduced
below the well-recognized
minimum
of
terrestrial
materials,
but this minimum
is in every case so near zero,
compared
to the figures for ordinary balloon fabric, that the point is
of no practical
importance.
Applying
the results
to a dirigible
and taking the items one at a
time: If the weight
of fabric is reduced
to the assumed
minimum
it
W
will save -_ of the total running expense
of the dirigible;
where
W is
the total weight of fabric saved and U is the useful load carried.
If diffusion is entirely eliminated
it will save the entire cost of gas
(including
labor and overhead)
except
that which escapes
through
the valves,
the interest
on the original inflation,
and liability
to accidental deflation.
If the fabric is made infinitely
durable it will save all the depreciation of the gas hag except that due to accidental
injury.
If the heating coefficient
is reduced to zero it will save the running
expense
of that part of the control system which serves to correct the

and speed of 40 miles per hour.
Other data could be reasonably expected
as follows:

For proportional

the most

it will be seen that lightness
is by
while mere
cheapness
of fabric
is

almost the last thing to be sought.
The table also furnishes
means of determining
whether
a proposed
change in the design of a fabric is worth while.
In effecting
a certain'improvement
other qualities
are generally
affected
at the same time, sometimes
adversely.
To determine
the
degree of net improvement
multiply
the per cent improvement
in each

by its quality
gauge number,
and add up the products.
If
the result is oositive
a net improvement
has been effectedprouortional
to the magnl'tude
of "the figure.
For instance
a 5 per cent s'aving in
weight
would he worth while even if accompanied
by a 20 per cent
increase
in cost, other things remaining
the same.
It should be carefully
noted that this particular

It has been arguea
Dy some that the economic

NOTE.--Although usually associated, for obvious reasons, balloon and aeroplane fabrics have actually become so dissimilar in many respects, such as materials of construction and requirements for satisfactory results, that for the most part the two
will be discussed separately.
The tearing and surface friction tests, being common
to both, are exceptions to tiffs rule. The plan followed as far as possible in this
report has 1)een to give first the results of the various parts of the investigation,
with such descriptive matter, data and plates as are necessary to make the results
clear. The data and other details are given in the appendix.
For convenience
the data is groulaed somewhat differently in the appendix, without, it is thought,
causing any contusion.

MATERIALS

FABRIC.
USED.

By far the greater part
of the aeroplanes
in use to-day
have wings
made of a textile
falSric, usually
linen,
coated
with a more or less
waterproof,
practically
nonelastm
varnish.
This is ordinarily
some
form of ce]lfilose
acetate,
or less frequently
cellulose
nitrate,
with
more or less softening
material
added,
and some suitable
solvent.
It is ordinarily
the practice
to apply
three
or more coats of this
varnish,
rubbing
down with
sandpaper
after
the
coatin_
is dry,
after which one or two coats of high-grade
linseed
oil varnisn,
preferbly a spar varnish,
are applied.
1.

COATINGS.

The cellulose
acetate
or nitrate
lacquer
is chiefly useful because
it
acts as a sort of waterproof
sizing, which shrinks
the cloth more or
less, and prevents
it from chan_ng
in tension
with the hv__roscopic
conditions
of the atmosphere.
1he spar varnish
protects
_t_is layer,
which
often shows
a tendency
to peel, and makes
the wing more
waterproof.
This form
of treatment
is convenient,
and the materials
fairly
easy to obtain.
On the other hand it could hardly
be called permanent;
the varnish
or dope, as it is commonly
called, must be applied
to the wings of a machine
every few weeks, if the machine
sees much
service.
Another
defect noted
probably
more by the United
States military
branches
than abroad,
is-that
due to deterioration
of the underside
of
the fabric from moisture
and bacteria.
Tile dopes owe their shrinkin_
action
to the fact that they are colloids,
and as such, when applieu
to the cloth, do not penetrate
but remain on one side.
As the solvent
evaporates,
the gel decreases
in volume.
The most evident
decrease
is oicourso
in the thickness
of the layer, but there is naturally
a tendency for the other
two dimensions
of the layer of drying
varnish

AERONAUTICS.

141

to decrease,
causing
the well known
shrinking
effect.
Other colloids
produce
the same effect;
for example,
glue.
Another
example
is
the common
gummed
label, which being unable
to shrink,
curls up.
At Vcra Cruz it was found that
there was considerable
tendency
for
the uncoated
side of the win__s to rot, owing to this lack of penetration.
On the other hand,
t_ose
varnishes
which
penetrate
do not
produce
the shrinking
effect.

linen is the most satisfactory.
Ramie
and cotton
been used to some extent,
but the former
is difficult
to obtain
the latter
does not take
the varnish
so well as the linen and
much easier.

Practically
all of the linen suited
for this purpose
comes from
abroad,
chiefly
from
Ireland.
An investigation
of the
relative
weights
and strengths
obtainable
is, particularly
at the present
time,
rather
difficult
to make complete.
Added
to this there is the difficulty
of obtaining
material
of exactly
the same grade from time to
time
The fabrics
in general

tested
at about
65 per cent q humidity,
of from 60 to 70 pounds
per inch for the lighter
weight
to
100 pounds
per inch for the heavier
weight.
In the following
experiments
we have used two grades
of linen,
No. 1, called high grade,
being about
the best material
immediately
obtainable
in sufficient
quantities
for our work, and No. 2, medium
grade.
The No. 1 weighs
4.6 ounces
per square

and has a
tensile strength
of about 90-95 pounds per inch warp and 60 pounds

The
No. 2 medium

weighs
about
3.8 ounces
per
square
yard and has a strength
of about
65 pounds
warp, 50 pounds
_iller.
DOPES.

The varnishes
or dopes used were three
representative
products
obtained
in this country.
The cellulose
acetate
varnishes
are probably far from perfect,
owing
to the difficulty
of obtaining
a satisfactory
product
in this country.
We understand
that
the latest
European
material
of this sort is a vast
improvement
on anything
heretofore
produced.
The solvents
for cenulose
acetate
commonly
used are acetone
or
tetrachlorethane.
The latter
is said
to be rather
dangerous
on
account
of its poisonous
properties,
and care should
be used
to
allow the vapors,
which
are heavier
than
air, to pass through
yen°
tilating
openings
ill the floor.
Mention
must
a|so be made
of a material,
the use of which
in
Europe
has been mentioned
in news reports.
This is a transparent
celluloid
made
of cellulose
acetate
compounded
with
a camphor
substitute
and used in the form of a thin, transparent,
noninflammable sheet.
These are used for wings instead
of cloth,
and are said
to be very difficult
to see at a height of a few thousand
feet.

TESTS.

STRENGTH.

The samples
on which these tests are b_sed_iere
made in two ways:
(1) The method
used in most cases, excerpt s_hen others_ise
specified:
The linen was stretched
moderately
on a frame about 3 by 4 feet, and
fastened
by tacking.
The dopes, etc., were applied
to this.
(2) The
second way (used only in special cases) : The linen was doped without
first being stretched
on a frame.
(1) In general
there is a gain in tensile
strength
due to the dope.
No added effect was observed
from the varnish.
(2) With a high-grade
linen 5To. 1, the increase in strength
amounted
to about
10 to 15 per cent.
With a medium
grade, the increase,
particularly
in the filler, was much higher,
about 40 to 60 per cent.
(3) Tests
made on high-grade
linen No. 1, coated
without
being
stretched
on a frame,
showed
a much higher tensile
increase--in
the
neighborhood
of 40 per cent in some cases.
In the first samples,
stretched
fairly tight before
co_ting,
there was evidently
not much
shrinkage,
in the latter
samples
the cloth shrunk
at will, in some
cases 3 or 4 per cent.
In specifying
the increase
in strength
due to
dopes, the method
of coating
is therefore
of importance.
The first
tests ,probably
approach
more nearly
the conditions
of use on the
aeroplane.
(4) Linen
coated
with rubber,
with or without
dopes,
is stronger
than uncoated
linen.
(5) Medium-grade
linen
shows a greater
increase
in tensile
than
high-grade
linen, in some cases about twice as great an increase being
observed.
2.

STRETCH.

The stretch
at different
loads was measured
for several
different
samples and curves
plotted.
The following
points
were noted:
(1) The stretch
isless up to a certain
load with coated fabrics
than
with the same fabric uncoated.
(2) There
is no decided
difference
between
cellulose
acetate
and
cellulose
nitrate
dopes.
The latter
is usually
supposed
to give less
shrinking
than
the acetate.
It is possible
that
this view arises to
some extent
at least from
the fact
that
fabrics

While

to have

EFFICIENCY.

a wing

material

which

will not

easily

sag, at the same time !t is also important
to have
a fabric
yield
rather
than
break
under
load.
A material
which
has this ability
will often
by yielding
reduce
the stress,
and so stand
usage which
would otherwise
be disastrous.
A convenient
index
of this, which
for want
of a better
term we
call the efficiency
of the fabric,
is the work required
to break a piece
say 1 inch wide and 12 inches long.
This is represented
by the area
included
by the stress-stretch
curve.
We have calculated
this value
for the various
materials
examined.
The details
and data are given
elsewhere,
but the following
points
may be mentioned
here, observations being based on breaking
in the direction
of the warp, since the
fillers do not show such marked
differences.
(1) When the linen is fastened
to a frame under fairly strong
tension, as would ordinarily
be done in covering
a wing surface,
and_ then
coated,
the work required
to break
a piece of given
dimensions
is
not sensibly
greater
than
that
to break
the uncoated
material,
in
spite of the fact that
the actual
tensile
strength
of the linen seems
to be higher
after coating.
This holds for high and medium
grade
linens.
(2) Linen
coated
under no tension
required
about
two and onehalf times as much work to break
as uncoated
linen.
The greater
stretch
and increased
tensile
strength
are both responsible
for this.
In view of this the suggestion
is made that there is probably
some
advantage
in not using any more tension
than is necessary
in fastening the fabric
to the frames
before
coating.
The dopes have considerable
shrinking
power,
measured
linear]y,
and by allowing
the
cloth to shrink
a certain
amount
the slack will be taken
up and at
the same time a greater
efficiency
obtained.
A stress from collision,
etc., will then have a chance
to exhaust
itself without
breaking
the

144

A_aO_AUTmS.

cloth,
since the cloth can "_ve"
and thus adjust
itself to decrease
the amount
of the stress.
We understand
that
one manufacturer
of the varnish
at least
recommends
this.
We have also been told that
in some cases, as
when a wing collides
with an obstruction
in landing,
a dent may be
formed in the fabric without
breaking,
this dent later disappearing.
Since the varnish
coating
is noncrystalline,
and can really be considered in a sense a supercooled
liquid, it seems quite likely that there
ma)- be some flowing
action
permitting
a slow readjustment
of this
sort.
(3) The use of spar varnish
seems to have no decided
effect on the
efficiency.
(4) Rubber
on one side of the ]inen with various
coatings
showed
an efficiency
about
75 per cent higher
than
that
of linen
without
rubber, coaled on frames.
This is of course partly
due to the greater
stretch
of such a fabric,
as already
noted.
It would
be interesting
to find by practical
experiment
whether
a fabric with rubber
on one
side can be made to shrink sufficiently
for use on a wing.
From our
small experiments
it seems likely that it would
be satisfactory.
If
so, it would
have the advantage
of being protected
on the under
side, a matter
of consequence
in certain
localities,
as already
shown.
4.

AGEING.

Samples
subjected
to continuous
exposure
for three
weeks
in a
location
such that the material
felt the full effect of sun and weather
throughout
the day gave the following
results
on tests:
(1) The tensile
strength
was 66 to 75 per cent of the original.
(2) In all cases samples
had been greatly
affected
by the weather,
in appearance
and feeling.
Spar varnish
coatings
cracked
and pealed;
samples
doped but not coated
with spar were more or less scrubbed
off by the weather
and had evidently
deteriorated.
(3) In several
cases samples
doped
and varnished
with spar varnish showed
a smaller
decrease
in tensile
than
those
unvarnished,
but the effect was not so pronounced
as would be expected.
(4) Cellulose
acetate
coatings
seemed
more affected
by the ageing
than
cellulose
nitrate.
This is probably
due to the hygroscopic
character
of the former
material,
and to the ease with
which
oils
are blended
with the latter,
making
it more waterproof.
III.

FIREPROOFING.

Tests on fire resisting
properties
of various
fabrics
were made,
to
find the effect of the different
coatings,
and to investigate
the Oossibilit_r of impregnation
of fabric with_fireproofing
materials.
-_:f(_t]_oc! )Ctest.--A
o
strip of the fabric
¼ inch wide, was held horizontally,
coated
side up, and the end touched
to a Bunsen
flame for
a distance
just sufficient
to ignite.
The time required
to burn back
for _ distance
of 3½ inches was observed;
in cases where the flaluo
was extiuguished
before
this point was reached,
the actual distance
was noted.
Care was taken to avoid drafts.
(1) All coated
fabrics
not otherwise
treated
were inflammable;
that
is, the piece
continued
to burn
after
the source
of heat was
removed.
(2) Spar varnish
seemed
to retard
the burning
of fabric
coated

Untilrecently
it was very d]fIienlt
to obtain

Labor and other conditions
in Eur@e
have
permitted
a greater
concentration
upon
the spinning

of such fabrics.
The results
have been that until recently
no cotton
fabrics
comparable
t.o those made in Europe
eould be ob}ained.
Recently
there have been produced
in this eountrx
fabrics
which
from the )tandpoint
of weight

It is to be hoped that the same'perfection

may also be obtained.
In the _ormcr operatmn

admit
the

in time'this
can be
met.

is important,
in order to get a fabric

The _,,_olumo loss is of course important,

it is found that there

If the values

it will be noted
(fig. 9,

that the curve rises more rapidly

Our results
show a temperature

It may be that the nature

ha.s considerable

This high temperature

is of peculiar
importance
ia this

where the aeronautic

of both Army and Navy are

LACQUERS.

It has been the practice
in Europe
for some time, apparently,
to
coat the outside
of balloons
with some sort of varnish.
These are
sold under
various
names,
but in general
are cellulose
acetate
lacers.
They
are used
to cut
down
wind
resistance,
to protect
e fabric,
and to render
it gas tight in cases where the rubber
has
deteriorated.
Samples
were given four coats
of cellulose
nitrate
and cehulose
acetate
lacquers
1876 and
1877,
respectively,
the lacquer
being
_pplied
to t_he cloth.
In both cases the iml_rovement
in _3ermeability was definite,
though small, amounting
to from 1 to 1½ hters per
square
meter per 24 hours.

The improvement was very marked
here, amounting
to 50 per cent or more of the

In one ease timre was a

Unfortu_ately
these lacquers
arc not suited for use on rubber

that
a marked

SURFACE

FRICTION

TESTS.

Tests on the resistance
of various
fabrics
were made in the wind
tunnel
at the Washington
Navy Yard.
The method
used was to suspend
vertically
a glass plate about 34
inches wide and 9 feet long so that its long edge is in the direction
of
the air floyd.
The following
edge of the plate is connected
with the
balance,
allowing
the horizontaJ
moment
about
one knife edge to be
measured.
Corrections
were found and used for the wires suspending
the plate.
The ends of the plate fitted into slots in struts
of stream
line form.
The wind passing
the slot into which the leading
edge fitted caused
a
diminution
in pressure,
giving
the effect of a thrust
on the plate
against
tim wind.
The wind caused a compression
in the slot in which
the followinc, edge fitted, likewise giving the effect of a thrust
against
the wind.
_he amount
of pressure
deveYoped in each slot was observed
with a hook gauge manometer,
and from this and the area of the edges
could be calculated
the correction
to be added for eachspeed.
The resistance
of the plate glass was taken as standard
and found at
30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 miles per hour.
_Tarious samples
of fabric were
then attached,
coverin_
both sides of the glass comnletelv
in each case
and the resistance
measured
at different

I. From these figures it will be seen that we may roughly
divide
surfaces
into groups as to wind resistance.
(1) Those which are what, might be called continuous;
in this case
the resistance
probabl_/increases
simply
as the surfaces
deviate
from
a true plane
due to lumps
and other
unevennesses.
Plate glass,
doped,
varnished,
and rubberized
fabrics
come in this class.
The
resistance
does not exceed 1.20, glass being 1.
(2) Those which have a discontinuous
surface,
i. e., such as would
be presented
bv a perfectly
smooth
woven material,
as a wire gauze;
linen
and
singed
cotton
approach
tiffs.
Here
the
resistance
is
between
1.35 and 1.7.
(3) Those which have a discontinuous
surface
to which
is added
other
rouglmesses,
such as arise from nap.
Unsigned
cotton
is in
this class, and the resistance
is 1.5 or more.
II. It is interesting
to note the great
improvement
produced
on
balloon
fabric by the use of one or more coats of some sort of varnish.
III.
The difference
in resistance
between
an uncoated
fabric
of
class (3) and plate
_,lass is very appreciable
at high speeds,
being
about 0.013 pound
per square foot at 70 miles per hour.
This would
mean a totalhead
resistance
in a large machine
of about 18 pounds,
or a decrease
in lifting power of 150-180
pounds.
However,
as can
be seen from the list, it is fairly simple
to cut down the resistance
until it approximates
that of glass.

In Great Britain
there has recently
been adopted
the method
of
testing
the sample
wet, after soaking
some time.
This is to avoid
error due to humidity
changes.
While this method
may seem somewhat
arbitrary,
it is convenient
and nearer
the conditions
of use
than a test on absolutely
dry material.
They figure that
this test
corresponds
to what could be expected
at a theoretical
humidity
of
111 per cent.

The strength
was measured
both ways on each sheet, since it was
thought
that the material
might show a grain,
such as often occurs
in materials
in sheet form which have been made by a calendering
process.
Except
ill the case of No. 2, there is no Derceptible
difference in strength.
The material
runs
fairly
unitorm
in strength
except
for the one sheet
No. 3.
Column
4 shows
the difference
between
the hi_ghest and lowest tests, compared
to the average.
The material
is quite flexible, in thin sheets,
and can be bent double
several
times in one place
without
cracking.
Oil the other hand,
it
tears very easily when once cut.
It is _loninflammable.
STRETCHING

TESTS.

Figures
1-4 show the relation
between
load and per cent stretch.
The numerical
values for the tests are given on page 155 and need
little comment.
The tests were made ou a Riehle fabric-testing
machine,
and measurements
were made
on an initial
distance
of 20 inches,
so the
results
are l)robably
quite
accurate.
The jaws moved
apart
at a
rate of 6 inches per minute.
It is interesting
to note that
the rate of stretch
is usually
low in
doped fabrics
up to 10 to 20 pounds
load, after which it rises more
rapidlv.
On the other
hand,
the uncoated
fabrics
tend to be just
the ot_posite
of this--that
is, there
is a considerable
stretch
at first
uudcr l_ght load, up to say 20 pounds,
then the "slack"
having
been
removed
from the fibcrs,
the stretch
is much
slower.
It will be
noticed
that this holds true even for samples
when the total stretch
of the coated
fabric great_
exceeds that of the uncoated,
as in figure
2, Curves \III,
IX, X, XI, when the fabric was not stretched
on a
frame
without
coating.
The stretch
of the coated
fabric
only becomes equal to th,_t o_'the uncoated
at loads of 12 to 20pounds.
The applicatio_l
of this seems to lie iu the fact that ordinarily
even
at high speeds
the loading
due to wind pressure
is very light.
According
to Austerweil
1 even at highest
speeds
the load would
not
amount
to more than 145.5 kilograms
per meter,
or about
8 pounds
per inch.
Ordinarily
it would
be much less.
It would seem therefore that
from
the standpoint
of keeping
the fabric
taut
against
stretching
just as good results
could be obtained
by putting
it on
loosely
enough
to allow shrinkage,
and get the benefit
of increased
tensile
strength
and
efficiency
shown
by the fabrics
iu Curves
VIII-X,
inclusive.

TESTS.

In these tests wooden jaws were used, fitted to a Riehle fabric testing machine.
The jaws moved apart at a speed of approximately
6 inches per minute.
The Plates I-VI were made by setting up the machine in a dark
room,, putting the sample under, tension, and holdin,,._, a dryplate
against the sample.
An electrm bulb on the other s_de of the sample
furnishes light for the exposure.
In the case of cotton fabrics the
small size o_ the yarn and its transparency
gave _)oor definition" this
difficulty was removed by first coloring'the
sa/nple with a veliow
naphtha
soluble dye.
T_ae photographs
are therefore

and show up the conditions of the threads quite clearly.
The factor obtained by dividing the breaking load fo_: a 1-inch cut
b_ that for the uncut fabric givessome
idea as to the relative tearing
resist_mce of various materials.
Illis, with the actual tensile, should
furnish a good basis for comparing fabrics as to suitability.

From the above fi__ures it will be seen that the lower grade of linen
is relatively
more d_ifficult to tear than the high grade.
This is
probably because the higher grade fabrics, both linen and cotton, owe
their greater strength
for a given weight to the greater number of
yarns :per inch.
These are of necessity smaller, and since tearing
depends to a considerable
extent on the strength
of the individual
threads, we find that strong, closely woven fabrics tear more easily
in proportion
than weaker ones.
A good example of this is the filler
of the cotton fabric, compared with filler of No. 2 linen.
The actual
tensile strength of the cotton is higher, but the effect of a cut much
greater, giving the factors as shown: 0.36 for the cotton and 0.57 for
the linen.

TESTS.

As already
stated
in the main body of the report,
the method
used
was similar
to that
of the National
Physical
Laboratory
of Great
Britain,
in which the hydrogen
diffusing
{hrough
the fabric is burned
to water
and weighed.
Owing to the limited
time at our disposal,
the tests were each two
hours
in length.
Several
tests were made
on each sample
at each
temperature,
and ordinarily
agreed w!thin a few per cent, when the
shght temperature
differences
were allowed
for.
(To save time the
thermostat
was not run always at the same temperature,
but simply
kept
constant
at one temperature
for each
run.
As the
room
temperature
varied
greatly
from day to day during
the period
in
which the tests were made,
this made the ol_eration
of the thermostat more simple,
and in addition
gave in many cases a further
check
on the temperature
effect.)
The diameter
of the cell was 220 millimeters.

(1) It will be noted thtlt gelatin conlpound gives very low per'
meabilitv.
The use of o"
_elatm on fabric for balloons was suggested
by Julhe.'
Austerweil tried this and found 2 that at first there was
practically no loss in volume, even a slight gain due to gases dissolved
in the w_ter.
After 35 hours the membrane
was apparently
saturated and los_ gas at practically
the same rate as the comparison
rubber membrane.
On the other hand, although each of our tests
was only two hours long, the total time in which the cell was filled
with h',/drogen, and the gelatin-rubber
fabric in place, was 48 hours,
yet at'the end of that time, when the tests were made at 40 ° C., the
_termeabilitv was only one-fourth that of the rubberized fabric alone.
is possibl'e that in coutact with dry rubber and dry gases, as in our
apparatus,
the membrane might act differently.
(2) Another point of interest is the test on fabrics 2 and 3 compared
with fabric 19. The ilrst two were experimental
samples, and for
convenience made parallel.
The fabric 19 was bias, yet showed practically no difference in permeability.
There has been some indication
in tests made at the National Physical Laboratory that parallel fabrics were much more permeable.
They state that probably
the
method of manufacture
has a considerable
effect.
This has ]tot been
noticed in our tests, and the reason for any such difference is not
apparent..

Agiug by cotttinuous
exposure
for one
month caused no increase in p(rmeability
; in fact, one of our samples
seemed improved.
The rubber layers were apparently
unaffected,
so this improvement
was not due to resinification
which has been
noted in Elxgland, bug was more likely due to a slight v_riatiou
in
samples.

INTRODUCTION.
The relation
of skin friction
or surface
friction,
to the relative
velocitv
of a surface
and the surrounding
medium,
and the variation
of thisrclation
with the nature
of the surface is of growing importance
to the science
of aeronautics.
Owing
to the greater
s_)eeds now
....
"
"
developed
m air craft of all kinds, it _ r as decided
to mvestlgate
these
relations
with particular
reference
to the sort of surfaces
which would
be used in aeronautic
work.
W. Froude'
measured
the resistance
for various
surfaces of various
lengths
in a water
channel,
and the results
of his experiments
lead
to the following
conclusions:
1. The force tangential
to the plane due to skiu friction,
ordinarily"
varies
according
to the 1.85-2
_ower
of the velocity
for sinooth
surfaces.
For rougher
surfaces,
it varies
practically
as the square
of the velocity.
2. The length
of the plane has a decided
effect on the average
resistance
per unit
area,
the resistance
decreasing
as the length
increases.
3. Smooth
surfaces
do not necessarily
increase
according
to a
lower
power
of the velocity
than
ro_lg.]_er surfaces,
although
the
numerical
value of the resistance
per umt area is less.
4. The index decreases
as the length
increases
for smooth
surfaces.
Zatim 2 measured
the resistance
due to surface friction
of planes in
a current
of air, and found that all smooth surfaces
showed an increase
in resistance
according
to the 1.85 power of the velocity.
Buckram
with 16 threads
per inch gave a high resistance
and an index of 2.05,
practically

He measured
the resistance
of planes
of various
lengths
and
obtained

of a plane
with its velocity
and surface

Through

the

kindness

of the

Bureau

of Construction

and

Repair

of the Navv
Department
the excellent
facilities
afforded
by the
wind-tunnel"
of the Washington
Nay 5 Yard
became
available
for
experiments
on the frictional
resistance
of various
surfaces.
These
experiments
were made for the purpose
of looking
into the matter
of surface
friction
with particular
reference
to surfaces
of the sort
which wouhl
be of most interest
from the standpoint
of aerommtics.
A glass plate about 9_ feet long and 34 inches wide was suspended
verticall,¢,
with its surface
tangent
to the direction
of the wiad,
by
two wires fastened
to the upper
edge of the plate.
The ends of
the.plate
were enclosed
in slots in ieaired struts,
which
were fixed
rigid to the floor and ceiling
of the tunnel,
and stayed
to prevent
vi_bration.
Smooth
steel rol_[ers attached
to each si¢le of the slots,
at the upper and lower ends, prevented
side movement
of the
They did not ordinarily
touch the latter,
being set t(l, alh_w a
ance of 0.01 inch.
Thus
the plate was free to move within
only in the line of the air current.
The trailing
edge of the plate was connected
by a steel rod

although
Tubes

were set in the slots and connected
with a hook gauge manolneter.
From the pressure
at each end, the force on the plate was In¢.asured
for different
velocities,
and by a faired curve, a set of corrections
at
different
velocities
was obtained.
Both of thcse corrections
are to
be added since the air rushing
past the slot in which the leading
edge
fits causes a diminution
in pressure,
and in the other slot, an increased
pressure.
Both
of these changes
in pressure
would
give a thrust
against
the wind.
The correction
for the wires was found
by adding
4 more suDportins
wires, makine
6 in all and measuring
the force on the platte
with
t_hese additiona']
supports,
then
removing
the original
wires
and measuring
the resistance
of the plate at different
velocities
with
four wires.
Subtraction
gave the effect of the two wires, which were
used as supports
in all regular
tests.
This correction
is of course
to be deducted
from the observed
force.
To 'tvoid masking
small
wedges were used
to hold the added wires away from the gl:a'ss, the
added wire passing
around
under the lower edge of the plate in each
case.
SURFACES.

Plate
glass was used as a standard,
or ideal surface,
since it is
probably
as smooth
as any surface,
and can be easily
duplicated.
the various
fabrics
were attached
to this by a nitrocclhflose
varnish,
bv which,
with a little
practice,
we were able to obtain
a surface
pract ics.llg smooth,
so far as unevennesses
from wrinkles,
etc., were
concerne(1.
The amount
of varnish
needed
was so small and its
colloidal
nature
such that
it was poss,!ble
to attach
linen
to the glass without
affecting
the outer
surface
appreciably.
The linen
surface
could
then be tested,

AEI_ONAUTICS.

When more than
two coats
of varnish
were applied,
the surface
was sand-papered
l)(_twe(;i, each coat.
Where
fabric_
were singed
between
tests,
the singeing
was done
with a blow-torch.
The surfaces
tes_d
may be grouped
as follows:
1. Plate _lass.
2. ; aerie sunaces
with nap.
3. Fabric
surfaces
without
nap (linen and cotton).
4. Varnished
fabrics
(cotton
and linen).
5. Rubber
coated
linen
(plain and aluminum
surface).
The experiments
were made at velocities
of 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70
miles per hour.
Owing to the large size of the plate
(area about
50
square
feet)
the forces
were large
enough
to enable
considerable
accuracy
to be obtained.
For example
m the case of plato glass,
the gross uncorrected
force is about
0.27 pound
at 30 miles per hour.
On this account
and also on account
of the greater
range of velocities we were able to detect
variations
in apparently
smooth
surfaces
which were not noticeable
in earlier
experiments
at low velocities.

Cotton
shows a higher resistance
than linen,
although
the cotton
surfaces
were finer weave than the linen.
The linen yarn, while of
more varying
thickness,
is smoother
than
cotton
yarn,
due to the
nature
of the ultimate
fiber and its greater
length.
The linen
yarn
is more like a wire.
The effect of varnishing
is very apparent,
although
no conclusion
can be drawn
as to the relative
merits of various
aeronautic
varnishes.
Probably
it is more a matter
of workmanship
in applying
and finishing the coat than any particular
merit in the varnish
itself.
The use
of a finishing
coat of spar varnish
gives some improvement.
The use of a varnish
seems particularly
advantageous
in the case
of cotton
fabrics.
This explains
the good results
obtained
in Europe
by varnishing
the gas bags of dirigibles
with cellulose
acetate
varnish, which both improves
the gas-holding
properties
of the bag and
decreases
the frictional
resistance.
In a weU-designed
balloon
most
of the resistance
offered by the air to the motion
of the balloon
is due
to fi'iction.
QUANTITATIVE.

If we plot the logarithms
of the velocity
(V) and frictional
resistance in pounds per square foot (F) we obtain practically
straight
lines.
From their slope we find the index n.
FigureII
shows the logarithmic
plots for the most interestHlg
cases.
It will be noted
that in many
cases the value for 70 miles per hour seems to lie above the line, possibly indicating
an increase
m the index as velocity
increases,
due to
greater
turbulence.
This has been predicted.
Using the slope obtained
by logarithmic
plots
and F= pounds
per
scjuare foot,
V= miles per hour, we may obtain
the constant
K, as
glven in Table I.
From these results
it will be noted that the smooth
surfaces
do not
necessarily
have lower indices.
When this was first noted it seemed
so anomalous
that it was thought
at first that there might
be some
experimental
error.
However,
we note that Froude
found a similar
result
(Table
III) in the case of tin foil, varnish,
and paraffin.
The high resistance
of fabrics
having
nap on the surface
is noteworthy.
Froude's
results
obtained
with an 8-foot plane in a water
channel
were reduced
to the same units, and to air conditions.
The values are
given
in Table
II.
Considering
the differences
in conditions
the
agreement
for smooth
surfaces
is close.
The resistance
of calico
was somewhat
higher
than
the cloth
resistance
found
in our tests.
from the photograph
accompanying
Froude's
paper I the fabric used
by him probably
had about
80 threads
per inch.
Those used by us
had about
120 threads
per inch, and on this account
presumably
a
smoother
surface.
VALUES

OF

K

AND

N.

As already
noted,
smooth
surfaces
may show a higher
index than
rougher
ones, while the coefficients
K vary in the opposite
direction.
To obtain
an idea as to the relative
values of these two quantities,
we
plotted
the values
of K and N as shown
in Figure
Ill.
It will be

noted that the results of our experiments
seem to show two distinct
types of surface:
1. Those having nap on the surface have high indices and high
exponents.
They act somewhat
similarly to ca|_co and sand-coated
surfaces investigated
by Froude,
and may be classed as rough,

are theroughest this class. At theother

and varnished fabrics, which may approach glass in smoothness under
good conditions.

smooth smgaeos lie remarkably
close to a straight line, the deviation

While

this expression
is purely
empirical,
in view of our results
it would
seem as if it might be possible,
within limits, to ex aluato the complete
equation
for a smooth
plane of fixed size, from the results
of one experiment.
To apply
this rigidly
would
of course
mean
that
the
curves for smooth
surfaces
must not cross, i. e., that one given value
of F and
V applies
to one curve
only.
While
our results
do no t
adhere
strictly
to this the deviations
occur generally
in the case of
curves
which
are so close together
as to almost
overlap,
and are
probably
due to experimental
error. A The value of K depends
on L,
but this can be figured as already
sh*bwn.
On the other hand,
Froude's
results
indicate
that
in the case of
water,
there is a fall in the index as the length
of the plane increases.
This change
seems to be in the opposite
sense to what would be expected.
The equation
R _ v9 L r V r
(2)
shows that L and V vary according
to the same power in every case.
We should expect
from this the same change
in r, whether
due to
change in L or V.
It is known, and our own experiments
indicate
that increase
in V tends to increase
r; in other words, at high speeds,
the resistance
would vary according
to a higher power of length
and
velocity.
It seems logical to assume
that this [nterchangea_)ility
of
V and L would give a similar
result as L increases,
namely,
that r
would also increase,
for both L and V.
These changes in index would
probably
be so small for ordinary
experimental
differences
as to be
negligible.

PREFACE,
In the preparation
of this report,
for which the time available
we9
limited
to alittle
less than three months,
all the literature
on nero
engines
that could
be obtained
in the libraries
of New York City,
or that could be secured
by loan or ]_urchase,
has been consulted.
Where valuable
material
was found in ioreign
languages,
translations
from the original
have been made and in many cases whole papers
or
illustrations
that seemed
worthy
of reproduction
have been photographed
for insertion.
The report is divided
into three parts, as indicated in the contents,
and at the end of the second part thecanclusions
and recommendations
will be found.
The third part includes
four
appendixes
consisting
of reproductions
of various
valuable
material
referred
to in the text, but separately
presented
so as not to break the
continuity
of thought
and argument.
In the very considerable
labor
involved
in colleetl_on,
translation,
and digestion
of the material,
my
colleague,
Prof. F. O. Willh6fft,
has rendered
most valuable
service,
which is gratefully
acknowledged.

Part I (a).--SERVICE
REQUIREMENTS
FOR AERONAUTIC ENGINES-POWER VERSUS WEIGHT, REIJABILITY, AND ADAPTABILITY FACTORS.
Transportation
over land and water has been revolutionized
by the
addition
of engine
motive
power
to vehicles
and boats
to a degTeo
that r(,quii'es
no study to appreciate
but the contribution
of the portable o_)wcr l)lant to aerial navigation
is evert greater.
It is fmulamc_t_dly
creative,
for without
the aeronautic
engine air flight would
be quite impossible.
Not only does an engine constitute
the essential
element
of the air craft, but the engine
must
be suitable
for the
purpose;
it must have certain
characteristics
never
before required
or produced
by engine designers.
Success in flight and improvements
in flying
nla(,l(finesrcsts
a_solutely
upon the success
with which the
entitle
and its accessories
that
make up the portable
power _lant
can be made
to fulfdl the new requirements
peculiar
to the hying
machine.
Before
someone
flew, no one could specify
just what
the
aeronautic
motor should be able to do, except that, of course, it should
be as light as possible
and not stop in the air.
Nor was there
ally
demand
for such an engine
that would
serve
as an inducement
to
engillc(.rs
familiar
with engine
production
to build one.
Ill short,
while those few experimenters
who were engaged
ia trials of balloons
and gliding
plan(s
felt they might
be helped
if they could secure
a
prop(,r light motor, no one felt sure it would be of service ff ]_roduced,
under
course no one could say how light it should be, or what other
characteristics
should
be incorporated,
except
that
of reliable
coRtinuous
rum_)ng during
a flight.
Formulation
of some of these specifications
ma) be said to date from about
the years
1901-2,
when the
Wrights,
on the one hand,
and Langley,
on the other,
found
that
existing
engines developed
for other classes of service were unsuitable,
the nearest
approach
being the automobile
enone , then pretty
uncertain in operation
and weighing
about 15 pounas
per horsepower
in the
lightest
Torms--a
weight
that would
not serve even if the operator
were willing
to risk his life on the possibility
of engine
stoppage
in
flight.
It was apparent
at once that redesign for reduced
weight
per
horsepower
was necessar),
and the Wrights
proceeded
to rebuild
the
automobile
engine, while Manly
boldly
departed
from any existing
189

190
practic_and
and _rights
automobile
make flight

AERO_AUTICSo
built his five fixed radial cylinder
engine,
both Manly
retaining
the water
cooling
of the most
successful
engines.
Both succeeded
in reducing
weight
enough
to
possible,
the Wright
engine producing
a horsepower
with

abou_ 7 pounds and the Manly with about2.4
pou_ds of engine weight,
the.former
with a 12-horsepower,
and the latter _ ith a 5O-homepower
engine.
Thus
was flight initiated
with engine
redesign
for weight
reduction, and so has flight improved
in range,
speed,
and saf(,ty,
with
further
redesign
of engine
m the 13 or 14 years
th.Lt have elapsed
since that time, but the end is not yet in sight.
The progress
that
has been
made
in engine
construction,
principally
i_l Europe,
is
truly amazing,
in view of the unique
charact(,r
of t_e probh,m
_nd
the _hort time that has elapsed;
but all this has only served t.o iucreas(_
the demand
of the aeronautic
engineer
on the e_gin(, (te_i,_ller and
mamffacturer,
so clearly
and firm_'y is the principle
ostablis_wd,
that

speeds,
power,
and
general
rehability,
that might
be classified
as adaptability
factors.
Any engine,
for whatever
service,
must be suitaMe,
aJl'(l its design
must_be
based as much on the sp(cifications
for suitability
involving
these
adaptability
factors,
as on the fundam(,nt,al
principles
of
thermodynamics,
stress resistance
and thc properties
of the materials
available,
and these adaptability
factors
must
be derived
from the
users or operators
of the machines
before
the engine
designer
can
interpret
them,
preparatory
to the incorporation
into the engine
proper
of those structural
elements
that will make it suitable.
At
t,he present
time there are available
some conclusions
along this line
of experience,
a few of which will be quoted
and summarized
before
undertaking
to analyze
the engine structure
proper.
After
nine
years'
use of engine-driven
aeroplanes
the
engine
structure
was summed
up in 1912 by Capt. II. B. Wild,
Paris,
as
from his own experience
_s follows :
The comparatively
crude
and unreliable
motor
that
we have
at our disp,osal
at the
present
time
is no doubt
the cause
of many
of the fatalities
and ac(:idems
befalling
the aeroplane.
If one will look over the accessories
atta_.hed
to the nero engine
of
to-day,
it will be noted
that it is stripped
clean
of everything
l_o_ible
whif.h
would
add head
resistance
or weigh1.
The
designer
of the nero engine
is t,)o a_xious
to
eliminate
what
he deems
unnecessary
parts
in order
to reduce
the weiuht
of the
engine,
and in doingso
he often
takes away
the paris
whi('h
help to strel,uthen
the
durability
and reliability
of the motor.
_
Few engine
designers
seem to appreciate
the importance
of eliminating
the least
tendency
toward
variation
of angtuar
velocity
or in the torque,
if the eu_dne is required
to drive
a propeller.
The effe(._ of continually
a('(',derating
aI_(t r(,tarding
a propeller
is most
detrimental
to its etlicienev.
_
_ _
In fr(mt
elevation
an ar_o engine
should
be as compact
as possible,
so "as to reduce
head
resistance.

generally
would also do well to visit aviation
grounds more frequently
and to take
more interest in the engines which have left their hands,
_ _ _ though in many
cases the aviator does not leave the engine alone when it is working right, but tinkers
with the different
adjustments
until they are all out of harmony
with one another
and places the blame where it does not belong.
_ _ _ The demand for a reliable
motor is still prominent.

Writing
quirements

in 1912, Awsbert Vorreiter, Berlin, gives the principal
which aviation engines have to meet, as--

re-

First. Small weight referred to horsepower.
Second.
Small consumption
of fuel, water, and oil, so as to obtain the maximum
possible radius of action with a given quantity.
Third.
Absolute reliability
since in the case of the dirigible
engine hardly any--in
the aeroplane engine absolutely
no--repairs
can be made during a flight.
In the demand
for low weight per horsepower
the requirement
of the low fuel and
oil consumption
per horsepower-hour
are included,
since to-day it is no longer a question of getUng a machine to fly for a short time only, but to construct flying machines
for practical
purposes,
we have to figure on a running time of several hours.
It may
easily" be shown by calculation
that an engine very light compared with output, but
reqmringan
excessive amount of fuel and oil, may weigh more per horse_)ower when
the weight of fuel and oil are included
than a heavy engine with low fuel and oil
consumption.
It is true that the oil consumption
cuts less of a figure bcJ.ause the
quantity
of oil as compared with the fuel is small and in a good engine amounts to not
more than one-tenth.
As a most favorable
value for fuel consumption
of an aviation
motor we may a_ume 0.536 pound per horsepower-hour,
which vame has been repeatedly reached in aeroplane
engines.
In dirigible
engines figures as low.as 0.514 pound
have been obtained.
Hand in hand with the reliability
goes the demand for durability
and continuous maintenance
of high capacity.
It is here that older constructions
of aviation
engines
sometimes
falldown
very badly.
Only the continuous
output which the engine is
able to give is to be seriously considered
in an aviation
engine as distinct
from the
automobile
engine.
While the latter is only very seldom required
to give its maximum output--and
then only for a short time--the
aviation engine almost always runs
under full load.

Additional

specific requirements

mentioned

include-

(a)

carburetor
action
and engine performance
must be independent
of barometer,
of temperature,
of dust, and of tiltingof
engine, (b) uniform turning
movement,
(c)
balance of engine parts, (d) high enough energy in rotating parts to produce fly-wheel
effect to resist variable propeller resistances
and maintain
engine speed, (e) propellers
give best efficiency at speeds lower than are feasible in engines--in
some cases as low
as half, (]) proper cooling of engine to insure lubrication,
minimum
distortion
of metal
parts, temporary
or permanent,
(g) locate exhaust discharge
away from operator,
(h)
least weight of engine by designing
for maximum
feasible speed, maximum
work
per cubic foot of displacement,
and least weight of metal of selected kind and cross
f_ction.

In a paper read before the institution
of automobile
engineers
(London) in 1912, Mr. A. Graham
Clark summarizes
the qualities
regarded
as essential
or desirable
in an aeronautical
engine,
as
follows:
(1) Reliability:
Failure
of the engine necessitates
the immediate
descent of the
machine,
if of the heavier-than-air
type, which, should it occur at an inopportune
moment, may be attended
with disastrous
consequences.
(2) High power weight ratio:
(3) Economy in fuel and oil:
Are desirable
because of the increased
radius of action.
wi(4) Low air resistance:
The importance
of air resistance
becomes
more marked
th increase in the speed, as the power absorbed m this_dlrec.tmn
vanes as the cube
of the velocity.
It may be remarked
in this connectmn
that the horsepower
reqmre(1
to propel a flat plate 3 feet in diameter
through the air is increased
from about 6 to
over 16 by increasing
the relative velocity of the plate to the air from 50 to 70miles
per hour.
(5) Controllability
or flexibility,
although
there is not the same need for it as with
engines employed
on automobiles,
is none the less a desirable
quality
since at low

192

AERONAU'rlCS.

speeds
of rotation
the propulsive
or tractive
effort
of the propeller
is inefficient
to
move the machine
along the ground,
and hence
the pilot will be able
to start up without assistance
should
circumstances
necessitate
his so doing.
Further,
as the engine
is not required
to develop
its full power
in horizontal
flight
and when
alighting,
the
ability
to vaw
the speed
during
descent
is certainly
preferable
to the crude
method
of s_itohing
the ignition
off and on.
(t;) Free(h,m
from
vibration
The necessity
f)r elimination
of vibration
as far as
PsOS_ible will be obvious
when
the slender
nature
of the supports
upon which
the engine
carried
is realized,
especiallyas
vibration
of a dangerous
character
may be set up
in the various
|)arts of the machine.
(7) Accessibility:
The question
of convenience
of access
is frequently
overlooked
or, at any rate, d_sregarded
on aeceunt
of the care and attention
which
is now given
to the clJzs of engine
before any extended
flight is made.
But it must be realized
that
from commercial
considerations
ahme,
apart
from the addition
to the time during
which
the machine
can be used
and which
mav,
under
some circumstances,
be of value,
it
would
be an advantage
to be able to readily
examine
or dismantle
any part,
especially
when
the applications
of the aeroplanas
are more widely
extended.
(8) Silence
is desirable
in any machine
used
for pleasure
or sporting
purposes,
but
when
it is intended
for empl,*yment
on nfilitary
reconnoissance
duties
at becomes
of
increasing
importance
to be able
to maneuver
without
giving
audible
warning
of
approach,
especially
at night.
• (9) Cleanliness
is in the nature
of a refinement,
but it is none
the less necessary
since
a dirty
appearance
is generally
caused
either
bv the oil splashed
about
during
hand
oiling
orby
the exhaust,
botli of which
are obj'ectionable--the
former
because
the part requiring
such at tenti.n
is apt at times to run dry owing to the irregularity
of
the supply
of lubricant,
and the latter
because
it indicates
an open exhaust.

Another
6ontribution
along similar
lines worthy
of reproduction
is that
of Granville
E. Bradshaw
before
the Scottish
Aeronautical
Society
(Glasgow),
December,
1913:
There
is probably
no form of prime
mover
in existence
that is more tfighlv
stressed
or that
has a more
strenuous
h'fe than
the aeroplane
and
there
is undout)tedly-no
engine
that
has greater
claims
on reliability.
The aeroplane,
manufacturers'
cry for
the extremel
li,,ht engine
is probably
greater
to-day
than
it ever has been
in the
history
of aviation.
The d(.mands
of'the
authorities
who purcha._e
aeroplanes
are
such that probably
as much as 90 i)or cent of the fa('tors
which
determine
the most successful
machine
are governed
directly
or indirectly
by the weight
efficiency
and fuel
efficiency
of the engine.
By the former
is meant,
of course,
the number
of pounds
of
weight
for every
horsepower
developed.
That
the engine
shall be extremely
reliable
is of course
taken
for granted.
Among
the essential
featur*,s
of all successful
aeroplanes
are the following:
(i)
It shall
climb
very
qui,.klv.
This depends
almost
entirely
on the weight
efficiency
of the engine.
The rate of climb
varies
directly
as the power
developed
and
indirectly
as the weight
to be lifted.
That
the aeroplane
shall
be very
efficient
in
this
particular
can easily
be umh_rstood
when
one. remembers
that
its capabilities
of
evading
destruction
fr(u_l projectiles
depend
to a great
extent
on how quickly
it can
get out of range of such pr@,(.tiles.
It must
also be efficient
in climbing
in order
to
successfully
rise from a small field surrounded
by tall trees which
may be necessitated
by a forcedlanding
during
a cross-country
flight over a populous
district.
(2) It shall have a good gliding
angle;
or, in other words,
that from any given
height
it shall be able to glide
for a great
distance,
is al_) governed
indirectly
by the weight
of 1he machine,
and consequ_ntly
by the weight
of the .power
plant,
because
a machine
with a heavy
power plant
must be designed
with a larger lifting
surface
and must
be stronger
in proportion.
With
the same
lifting
surface
and
head
resistance
the
angle
of descent
of the heavy-engined
machine
will be steeper
_ than that
of the liuht
ma(.hinc,
as higher
speed
is necessary
to support
increased
weight.
(3) It shall have a combination
of fast and slow flying speeds.
This is of paramount
importance
and
one ttmt
aeroplane
constructors
are paying
probably
the greatest
amount
of attention
to.
The capabilities
of a machine
to fly slowly
as well as fast
depend
almost
entirely
on the adoption
of an extremely
light and oowerful
enuine
If the machine
is designed
for very hioh
speed,
a slow speed
is only oossible
by the
mactline,
and
consequently
the
power
plant,
being
very
light.
Note.--The
"wing
characteristics
of lift and drift are also very
important.
(4) It shall
be safe to handle
in all win(Is
both
with
and without
the engine
in
operation.
Aeroplanes
have
been built
that
will
carry as much
as 15 to 20 pounds

er square
foot of supporting
surface,
but constructors
nowadays
agree that
the lightly
aded
machine
is the safer to handle
and the average
loading
on the planes
is to-day
generally
in the neighborhood
of 4 or 5 poundspcr
sguare
foot.
A hea_dly
loaded
machine
depends
to a great
extent
on high
speedof
flight in order to maintain
it in
the air.
Should
the speed
fall,
unconsciously
to the
pilot:
through
loss of engine
power
or from
any
ether
cause,
the control
becomes
sluggish
and
will not answer

the nose
is put
down

quickly
to increase
the
speed,

about
_ike a log in the sea and generally
ends
in a s_de slip and one
of these
terrible
nose dives
that
have deprived
us of so many
of our best pilot.s.
The
life of the pilot
of the heavily-loaded
machine
is more
dependent
upon
the good
behavior
of the engine
than is "the life of the pilot of the lightly-loaded
machine,
and
the latter
¢'ould
probably
go on flying
in search
of a good alighting
ground
with
two
or thr(_e cylinders
not firing at all.
(5
It shall
be able
to remain
in the air for long periods
This
depends
chiefly
on the oil and
gasoline
consumption
of the engine
and
without
efficiency
in thin
respect,
the extremely
light power
plane
is practically
useless,
as flights
of only
a
few minutes
duration
are not likely
to be of much
use in serious
warfare.
All the essentials
lust enumerated
and particularly
the last depend
of course
on
the engine
being absolutely
free from
any breakdow-a,
which
point has not been
dealt
with as it is not a debatable
one.
We are all without
doubt
of one mind on this matter.

Finally

tests the following
stipulation
wiil be noted:
"Motor
to be run'at
full power for one-hal'{ }io{lr under
conditions

rainstorm."
At the present
time many
of the important
conditions
that
an
aeronautic
engine must fulfill are pretty
wel! settled,
at least, in kind,
if not degree,
but every day sees some ne-_ attribute
announced
as
desirable,
so that while it can hardly
be said that acre service requirement s for engines are now reducible
to rigid specifications,
they can be
formulated
with enough
precision
to enable
an engine designer
and
manufacturer
to undertake
production
with some prospects
Of success
or acceptance.
In so proceeding,
however,
no designer
or manufacturer can afford to ignore past experience
in engine construction
nor,
on the other hand, may old constructions
be slavishly
reproduced,
for
what was acceptable
yesterday
may not be to-day,
and certainly
will
not be to-morrow.
All these service
requirements
can be classified
under
three headings for future more or less minute
analysis.
POWER-WEIGHT

RATIO,

RELIABILITY,

AND

ADAPTABILITY.

If the engine
complete
with full tank is light
enough
it can be
used--and
is most useful when most light., and this weight
involves
many factors,
each of which must be considered--some
indepeudent
of others
but many
interrelated.
_ihe longer
the contemplated
flight, the more change
there must be in the relation
between
specific
fuel and oil consumption
of the engine and the weight
of the engine
proper;
so in any consideration
of this item length
of flight must be
included.
Not yet, however,
ht_s the engine or flight art reached
the
point where it is prepared

195

and the minimum
possible
attainable
by only a few of the best--and
with increasing
flight lengths this is becoming
more and more a matter
of raising thermal
efficiency,
engine speed, arid cylinder
mean effective
pressure,
with correspon(ilng
re(tuction
of lubricating
oil.
On the
weight
question,
therefore,
it is not the service
conditions
that
specify what is wanted_, other than that it shall be as low as possible,"
....
but rather
the en.,lne (leslgner is put on h2s mettle
to say how far it is
possible
to go with due consideration
to the other
two elements-reliat)ility
and adaptability.
Reliability
is demantIed
always,
but how much?
Some writers
call for absolute
reli_/bility
an(t others
try to specify
in numerical
terms
a value
for one or another
of its elements.
For cx_mll)le ,
in the 1913 (lerman
te_ts, any engine that
dropped
to 85 per cent
of its normal
speed w_s rejecte(1,
and this stipulation
was reNtined
for the
1.914 competition.
Ag:dn,
in the British
conditi()n_,
the
only power
rating
allowed
was the least attained
at any time in six
hours.
Now at)solute
reliability
is impossible,
for this would
mean
continuous,
uninterrupted
operation
without
variation
in any respect,
except
at the operator
s will.
No such engine
has ever 1)een built
nor will it everbe
built.
Obviously
what_is
wanted
is as great
a
relial)ilitv
f.lctor
as the engine designer
and builder
can secure consistent
_'ittl other
factors,
so here again,
as with the unit wei__ht
factors,
the prot)lem
is one for the producer
to say how far the re]]at)ility can be assured,
rather
than for the user to specify
and reject,
especially
on laboratory
tests.
Itowever,
rejection
on such _roun(ls
is far more justifiable'than
acceptance,
for-the
engine
so _'cepte,d_
may fail on its first flight, due to some accident
or tofaulty
operator
s
adjustment.
_3aat is nee(led here is, first, analysis
of the reliability
factor
into its elements
an(l by cooperation
between
engine designer
and user, an aareement
on reasonable
values for each, so one will not
promise,
nor t]_e other expect
the impossible,
but each understand
clearly
the limits--and
more important,
the reason
for the limit-that xneans may be sought
to eliminate
the disturbing
cause.
About
the same situation
is true with the third factor,
adaptability,
and its elements--such
as shape,
vibration,
silence,
accessibility,
uniformity
of torque.
They may be specified
to-dav
only in
the qualitative
or comparative
way, though some of them ar_e capable
of formulation,
quantitatively,
such for example
as torque varitltions.
So far it has not seemed
feasible
to impose
any such limits but to
leave the field wide open to the designer
with an expression
of desire
for as high a degree of success
as is possible
with each.
The reason
for this state of affairs in the art is clearly
due to its
youth
and the necessity
at present,
and for some time to come, for
the maximum
possible
encouragement
of invention,
design,
research,
and manufacture,
until it becomes
clear to all just how far it is possible to go in any direction
after engaging
all available
resources
of
talent,
material,
money,
and plant.
When, after such a period,
one
or more standard
types of eng{ne or engine parts--or
even of air craft
itself--have
been established,
then will it be feasible
to specify more
particularly
and numerically
all the elements
of each of the factors
of unit weight,
reliability,
and adaptability.
In the meantime,
the problem
is one of review of engines produced
and an analysis
of their
construction
and performance
as a whole
and with it a similar
analysis
of fundamental
possibilities.
This must

include
a more or less standard
examination
of each of the essential
parts
of the engines
and the relation
of form and arrangement
to
the perfection
or imperfection
with which the part performs
its partial duty or function.
Even now, as Soreau,
reporting
the French
tests, points
out, the relative
importance
of low engine weight proper,
reliability
and life, and consumption
of fuel and oil, originally
considered
in this order, has been reversed,
experience
indicating
that
the last is now first and tlie first last.
Part 1 (b).--MEANS
EMPLOYED UP TO THE PRESENT TO PROMOTE
AERO-ENGINE
DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING POSSIBLE MEANS NOT
EMPLOYED.
Any new art develops
as fast as encouragement
is offered
or as
fast
_ts the necessary
means
are made
available
and intelligently
used, and, of course,
inversely
as the difIiculties
involved.
It would
be hard to find any class of machine
among those developed
in modern times that had to face the same inherent
difficulties
incident
to
the nature
of the problem,
or one that received,
at least for the first
few years,
so little real encouragement
and assistance
as this one,
the acre engine.
The initial
step is one of conception,
which must
be subsequently
checked
by construction
and trial.
This must
be
follo_edT_ by commercial
perfection,
which requires
endless
research
by test and computation--not
only on the machines
as a whole but
to a larger degree on each element
of the problem
that analysis
indicates to have separate
entity,
and on groups
of elements
that have
coordinate
functioning.
Construction
is here again necessary,
not
only of the complete
machine,
but also of variants
on each part, and
of instruments,
appliances,
models, and apt)aratus
that do not themselves enter into the result
but are essential
to its attainment.
Finally, with commercial
perfection,
further
construction
work is necessary to create the means
of rapid large scale reproduction
within
the
limits
of dimensions
needed
for interchangeability
of parts,
i. e.,
establishment
of the manufacturing
plant.
It must be understood,
however,
that
these
three
steps that
must
be undertaken
in this
order
on general
principles
may not be repeated
many
times over
even when concerned
with the same product,
such as the acre engine,
or that the earlier step ceases when the latter
is inaugurated,
for this
is not true.
These three stages or periods
of development
may, for
the _ ant of better
terms, be designated
as, first, the period of invention; second,
the period of design; and, third, the period of manufacture.
Design can not be undertaken
before invention,
whether
that
invention
be of the patentable
sort or not.
Yet invention
undoubtedly proceeds
long after design
has been firmly
established
and, of
course,
while manufacturing
may not be undertaken
until both invention
and design
have
accomplished
a reasonably
commercial
perfect product,
it goes without
saying that both inventmn
and design
will continue
during
the whole of the manufacturin_
period.
_ ith the exception
of invention,
which needs little encouragement
beyond
a stimulatmn
of the mm_,matlon,
the prnnary
factor
m successful development
is money, for, with sufficient
funds, the necessary
profcssional
s_:ill, l_tbor, mat (;rials, _nd plant may be secured for can'yl'ng out the steps of (lehigh and manufacture.
Of course, money may
t)(_,' and usu,flly
is, misspent
in these developments,

when

is in the hands

skill and

experience,
so there shouht be added the requirement
that organization be associated
with money.
No better iUustration
of this situation
can be given than that of the
steam turbine, whose period of development
practically
coincides
with
that of the aero engine, but which has been brought
to a state of commercial
perfection
that
the aero engine
has not even approached,
partly
by reason
of the better
understanding
of the service
requirements
that are not yet fully formulated
for the flying machine,
but
almost
entirely
because
of the differences
in the means employed
for
the development.
The steam
turbine
had its invention
stage,
and
while invention
still proceeds
it is largely
superse_!ed
by rational
design for manufacture,
under skillful
guidance,
under proper
organization, suitably
financed
and satisfying
an ample,
well-understood
market demand.
The aero engine is still largely undeveloped,
invention
is still more active than design, and the almost microscopic,
painstaking research
required
to establish
the data
necessary
for design
is
almost
wholly
lacking,
so naturally
manufacturing
in the true sense
of the term is correspondingly
nonexistant,
though
a few individual
models of engines
are being reproduced
in fair numbers.
The millions
of dollars
needed
for rational
perfection
for manufacture become
available
to the suitable
organization
ordinarily
only
when a permanent
market
is clearly
in sight and when the service
requirements
of the product
are reasonably
definite.
In the case of
the acre engine,
this market
has been absent
or at least very uncertain and the service
requirements
very hazy--both
so much so that
under
ordinary
conditions
the aero engine
could not have reached
even the degree of perfection
so far attained,
unsatisfactorv
as it may
be, without
other incentives
or different
sorts of encouragement
than
the ordinary
article
of commerce
receives
as, for example,
again the
steam
turbine.
This special element
in perfecting
the aero engine is
that of governmental
al(t based on military
necessity,
a comparatively
recent force in the situation
but now a _ ery strong
one in Europe,
but
almost
wholly
lacking
in America.
The military
establishment
can
purchase
what it needs in the market
only when there is a reasonat)ly
strong
civilian
demand
for the same article,
strong
enough
to warrant
the financial
investment
necessary
for its perfection--and
such is the
case with the automobile
and traction
engine.
On the other hand,
when there
is no such
demand,
however
active
invention
ma_" be
rational
design and manufacture
will be absent and must be sul)pliec[
by the Army and Navy tlwou_h
their o_m organization
and plants,
or, as an alternative,
reasonably
steady
annual
governmental
appropriations
for purchasin_sufficient
quantities
by the military
departments may be made the oasis of support
for civilian
produotion.
Such
is the case, for example,
with ordnance
and to some extent with ships.
For several
_-ears after the demonstration
that
engine-driven
air
craft could maKe successful
flights the only encouragement
offered to
develol)ment
was that
of adventurous
sport.
Men whose incomes
were sutllcient
became
purchasers
of machines
for their own amusement and others bought machin'es
for _mking exhibition
flights before
paying
audiences
for the profi_ to be dcri_ ed.
Both sorts of operators
took chances
with the imperfections
of the machine
in a spirit of adventure
or speculation,
Dut practically
all made
short
flights
that
made no such demand
on the engines
as is now standard.

Even as late as September, 1912, Mr. Earle L. Ovington,
writing
in the Scientific
American
reports:
Usually every 15 hours of running, and at most every. 20, my me(:hanics (skilled
men } went through the interesting process of separating every single component part
of mv motor, one from the other. The valves were reground and retimed, because
of valve-gear wear, new valve springs were inserted, the tappet rods were adjusted,
and the whole motor was given a rind lnspeetaon.

In view of this
possibility
too much care can not be exercised
in the preparation
and
regular
revision
of these
contest
rules and conditions
in order that
the result may be what is wanted
and what
is needed
by the whole
art, instead of a perfect
attainment
of a merely hypothetical
standard.
Attention
is called to these rules in the appendix
and especially
to the alterations
in later German
rules as compared
with the earlier,
all directed
toward
greater
latitude
and greater
reliance
on the
judgment
of competent
engineers
and proportionately
less on the
numerical
values
of those
quantities
that
are subject
to measurement
and which require
experienced
cultivated
judgment
to interpret into terms
of engine goodness
which often depends
as much on
intangible
things
such as workmanship,
ruggedness,
simplicity,
and
the other factors
of general
adaptability.
In this connection
there
is a most significant,
though
guarded,
statement
at the end of the
second report of the Deutsche
Versuchsanstalt
ffir Luftfahrt
by Dr. F.
Bendeman,
January,
1913, the best
document
on the subject

Even at best, better
than yet arranged,
the contest
exerts but an
indirect
effect on engine development,
it results
in a public statement
of a judgment
of the machines
relatively
considered
with refl,rence
to the rules and to each other.
The winner is stated
to be that engine that has best fulfilled
the prescribed
conditions;
it is announced
as better

and that is all.

in direct development
of engines

The only sort of direct

that
can lead

is that
generally

involves
the patient

the determination
of their causes
and
discovery
of remedies,
all of which are to be followed
by the application of the promising
prospective
cures with test checks
on their

This sort of work requires
the highest
class of training
and
skill and is to be carried out as much in the computing
and drafting

There
are now
on the market
perhaps
half this number
of different
engines
being
regularly
reproduced,
each to some extent
and several
clUito extei_
sively (for this art), and of several of these designs engines are available in more than one size.
While
most
of these
engines
have capacities
of 50 horsepower,
more
or less, the number
that
reach
or exceed
100 horsepower
is
steadily
increasing,
following
the demand
of the aeroplane
and made
ossible
by greater
experience
in construction
of the smaller
sizes.
t is worthy
of note that the 1913 winner
of the Gordon-Bennet
cup
race carried
200 horsepower
and the Russian
Sikorsky
used in his
17-passenger
machine
400 horsepower
in two engines.
The latest
Curtiss
aeroplanes
carry
320 horsepower
in two engines,
and the
English
Sunbeam
catalogues
a single
engine
of 225 horsepower.
While some types of engine construction
give trouble
in large sizes,
there
is no reason
to believe
that
the limit of engine
capacity
has
been anywhere
nearly
reached,
for even if a high limit of cylinder
diameter
be found,
which is not the caseyet,
multiplicity
oi_ cylinders can carry up total capacity.
Naturally
there is no limit to the
number
of separate
smaller
capacity
engines
that may be placed
ia
one air craft except
that as the weight
per total horsepower
of two
or more engines
is always greater
than of one engine of equal aggregate
capacity.
On the question
of total
power
there _s no high
limit in sight, though
the normal
is somewhat
about
100 horsepower.
Germany
m 1914 required
for her latest armyplanes
80 to 120 horsepower and more for hydroaeroplanes,
while the United
States
Navy
specifications
of 1915 call for 100 to 160 horsepower.
It may easily
happen
that
this trend
toward
larger
engine
capacities
will result
in the elimination
of some styles of engines
which only operate
well
in smaller
units,
or what is more likely as the number
of different
types of air craft increases
in the limitation
of engine
type to flying
machine
type.
A more or less complete bibliography
of nero engines is offered In Appendix 3 as a nucleus, as full as
the limited time available wili permit and to show the character of some of these papers, a selected few
are reproduced.
To complete this bibliography
and republish these papers will be of very g rent service

AERONAUTICS.

Speeds of engines are all in excess of 1,000 revolutions
per minute,
most
engines
operating
normally
between
1,200 and 1,500 revolutions per minute,
with a few exceeding
2,000 revolutions
per minute,
the highest
being the Sunbeam
engine, rated at 2,500 revolutions
per
minute.
These,
of course,
are the speeds
when
carrying
normal
full load and therefore
a reduction
of load,
such as would follow
a
change
of propeller
to one of lesser torque
or such as results
from a
gust of air in the direction
of propeller
air discharge,
will accelerate
the speed.
This is because
the full throttle,
mean torque,
of these
engines is about constant
up to speeds considerably
in excess of their
normal,
probably
approaching
2,000
revolutions
per minute
for
most of them,
though
in all mean torq_m will decrease
beyond
some
critical speed, due to valve and port resistance
on the one hand and
insuftlcient
speed of combustion
on the other.
Belo_
this critical
speed, which is partly
a matter
horsepower

proportional
is a natural
means
of reaching

It does not necessarily

however,
that,
because

the engine will not suffer from the speed.
In fact, it is just _ere t]lat
so many of the failures
are found, the engines literally
shaking
themselves apart
and pounding
or grinding
themselves
to pieces.
With
due attention
to the forces developed
by high speed, and to bearing
friction
effects of rapid motion
over loaded sliding
surfaces,
and to
the suitable
arrangement
as well as proportions
an_l materia'ls
for it,
there is no reason
why, from the engine operation
standpoint,
the
present
normal
range of 1,200 to 1,500 revolutions
per minute should
not t)(: exceeded
if tf_e service demands
it, thou__h the ensine desisner's

[_ must

there seems to be no essential
relation
betwei.n
propeller
speed and
el,.gine speed if the <Lpe,'ator has no objection
to gearing,
which
in
these days of automo|)ile
alloy steel gears can be made probably
the
most reliable
element
of the machine.
Testing
of engines
at excess
speeds
to limits
of unbalanced
forces,
bearing
friction
wear,
and
mean torque
would seem to be a rational
means of assuring
that the
operating
speed itself will not cause trouble
however
much
other
causes might
cuter.
Such a practice
would be somewhat
in accord
with the hydrostatic
test of 50 per cent excess of working
t)ressuro
now standard
with steam
boilers
and somewhat
similar
r)ecause
each may in emergency
reach
that
excess,
in the one case of speed
and in tile other of pressure
which may cause failure.
Engine weights
now attained,
per horsepower
developed,
exclusive
of tanks,
radiators,
and supplies
of gasoline,
oil, or water, by the several classes or types of machines,
at their own normal speeds, have not
been materially

for some time, attention
hawng been rather
concentrated
on the reliability
and adaptability
factors with existing
weiights , instead
of on further
weight
reduction,
though
this will
unaoubtedly
come in time.
There
is, however,
a rather
marked
division
of unit _engine weights
according
to system
of cooling
of
engine, whether
by air or by water, involving
besides
water weight,
that

For example,
the most popular
French

star c_linder
air-cooled
Gnome
en__ine weighs
just about
3 pounds
_per horsepower,
ranging
from .¼ _or 100 _orsepo_er
to 3_for
50
horsepower,
while

power.
(A number
of tables
and some charts
of engine weights
are
given in the papers
in the appendix
which are not repeated
here, as it
would
serve no good purpose.)
Attention
is however
called to the
fact that
the highest
weight
reported
in the German
competition
(second)
is about
6 pounds.
This is about
the present
high limit,
while 2.2, the value for the Gnome
100 horsepower,
is the low limit,
the water-cooled
group
occupyin_
the upper
portion
of this range,
the air-cooled,
its lower portion.
It is most interesting
to note that
the middle range in the neighborhood
of 4 pounds is occupied
by both
types, :providing
that water-cooled
engines
can be built as light as
some kinds of air-cooled
engines, or that air cooling does not necessarily
result in the lightest
engine.
Whatever
influence
in this unit weight
of engine alone the general
arrangement
may have is shown by a comparison
of figures for some
typical
differences
of arrangement
or type.
It ordinarily
is of the
order
of a fraction
of a pound
and may be entirely
offset by some
other structural
feature,
not a factor in general
arrangement,
such as
the use of a steel cylinder
in one arrangement
against
a cast-iron
cylinder
in the other, or a high mean effective
pressure
in one against
a"low value in the other due to different
weights
of active mixture
taken in per stroke.
It would seem that cylinders
set radially
about
a short
single throw
crank should yield an engine weight
per horsepower le_s than the same number
of cylinders
set in line along a long
multi
crank shaft.
Also that a Y arrangement
of two lines of cylindcl_ should weigh less than a single line because
of shaft and frame
diff_ren(:es,
butut
is not clear whether
a given output
in four c_lindcrs will yield a greater
or less x_eight than in six or eight simimrly
arranued(nor
is _t clear just what difference
in horsepower,
if any,
shoul(l
be expected
per unit of displacement
per minute
inwatercooled
as compared
_ith
air-cooled
cylinders.
As ])ointed
out,
accordinu
to the general figures given, the aggregate
of all such differences lic_between
the limiting_veights
of-about
2½ pounds
and 6
pounds
per horsepower
and
therefore
cover
a range
of about
3½
pounds
per horsepower
for such engines
as are now in use and for
which
test data are available.
Just how much
of this difference
is
chargeable
to one or another
of the factors
of arrangement,
detail
form, proportions,
or material,
it is not possible
at the present
time
to accurately
fix, but as a first attem_)t

These figures show a consistent
weight
excess for cylinders
in line
over radial,
but no conclusions
can be drawn on the relations
between
water
vs. air cooling
for either
fixed or rotating
cylinders.
More
data and data in greater
detail than are now available
are necessary
before such conclusions
are possible.
In later tables
the figures are
analyzed
with
reference
to other
units
and some
desirable
conclusi_ons are derived,
but always
there must be noted the data which
one would expect
at this date to be quite full and reliable
are found
to be both meager
and uncertain.
To the weight
of the engine
proper
with all the parts
that
are
permanent
features
built
on or into it, such
as the magnetos,
oil
pumps,
air fans, and water-circulating
pumps,
there must be added
the weights
of other parts to get the weight
of the power plant
with
empty
tanks.
These
additional
parts
may
be called
the engine
accessories.
All such supplies,
as fuel, lubricating
oil, and water
needed
for a given length
of run, will add more weight,
the amount
of which
depends
partly
on rate
of consumption,
partly
on the
_enerai
arra.n_,ement,
but principally
on the length
of the
ru.n.
_he fuel welgTlt to be carrmd
per horsepower
varms
directly
with
the length
of run and inversely
as the thermal
efficiency" of the engine.
The oil weight,
while
varying
somewhat
with the length
of run,
probably
is not directly
in proportion
to it and certainly
has nothing
to do with the thermal
efficiency
of the engine,
but rather
depends
on such factors
as quality
of the oil, mode of its application,
style
of engine,
bearing
temperature
and
surface
pressure
and
speed.
Water
in any properly
proportioned
jacket
and radiator
system
should
not be lost, and its weight
may therefore
be regarded
as a
fixed quantity
entirely
independent
of the length
of run and additive
as is a piece
of accessory
equipment
such as the radiator
itself,
though
its weight
value is, of course,
a function
of the aggregate
internal
volume
of jackets,
piping,
pump and radiator.
It needs only a superfici_
examination
of these weights
of accessories and supplies
compared
to engine weights
to see that for short
runs, engine and accessory
weights
are more important
than supply
weights,
but that for long runs the supply
weights,
espeei_flly
those
of fuel and lubricating
oil, will become
the controlling

Such relations
as these---(Bendemann
report
shows the weights
equalize
in 1½ hours'
operation)--lead
to that most important
conclusion derivable
from all the competition
test data in existence,
viz,
engines intended
for short runs nmst be themselves
light and need not
be especially
economical
if, by sacrificing
eeonomylightness
is promoted.
Conversely,
engines intended
forlong
runs must be economical at all costs, almost regardless
of weight.
It may also be added and
this seems most significant
that reliability
is of importance
about in
direct t_roportion
to the length
of run, assuming
good condition
to be
assure(1 before starting
in each instance,
so that, again on the grounds
of reliability,
short
run engines
must be light even if less reliable,
measured
byperiod
of uninterrupted
operation,
while to long-run
engines
considerable
weight may be added to gain reliability.
From the design
standpoint,
a broad
principle
of practice
can be
directly
derived,
to the effect that
for more and more widely
varying

aeroplane
engines
typ(s
of service

being intended
as to frequency

of flights,
length
of run, and load-carryi_g
capacity,
need not be o:f
one design,
style,
or type,
but that
different
ones are justified
and
good engineering
procedure
demands
the development
and perfection to equal degrees,
of as many different
types and characteristics
as will best serve the varying
requirements
of flight.
From
among
these,
a selection
may intelligently
be made for general
service
o:f
undefined
nature
but with ful[forehand
knowledge
of its capabilities
and limitations.
All this agrees with engineering
practice
iu other
fields for there
are to-day
not only more different
steam
engines
than ever before, but in any one group,
such as locomotives,
there is
greater
variety
than there ever was; why, therefore,
should
anyone
expect
to fred a single aeroplane
engine or plan the development
of

A_RONAUTICS.

m
but this can not be interpreted
to mean that
all aeroplane
engines
must conform
to one another
in arrangement,
performance,
or even
in materials
throughout.
Returning
to the factors
of plant
weight,
study
of which
leads
to such important
conclusions
as the preceding,
it "is worth
while to
examine
more closely
the separate
iniluences
of the several
component
factors
of accessory
and supply
weights.
Radiator
weights
must
vary
with
the amount
of sheet
metal,
cooling surface
of given nlaterial
in kind and thickness.
The _urposo
of this surface
is heat dissipation
to the air, so the number
olsquare
feet and its weight
will vary directly
as the jacket
heat lens of the
engine,
and directly
as the mean
temperature
difference
between
water
and air, but inversely
as the coefficient
of heat transmission.
The most reliable
data
on this amount
of heat to be dissipated,
in fact,
the only data
are given
by Bendemann,
who
finds
that
contr_,ry
to most
internal-combustion
engines,
including
the automobile class, which give up between
30 and 40 per cent of their fuel
heat, to jacket
water,
acre engines
confornl
pretty
closely
to 15 per
cent of the heat of (.ombustion
given to and carried
by the water
to
the radiat6r.
The difference,
15 to 25 per cent, is either not taken up
by the water
from the combustion
chamber
at all, passii_g out in
exhaust
gases instead,
or, bring
taken
in part by the water,
is dissipated
directly
from jacket and x¢ ater pipes to the air.
In formulating the rules of the German
competition,
the radiator
weights
were
assumed
to conform
to automobile
practice
and taken at 0.13 pound
per 1,000 British
thermal
units per hour, but the experiments
indicate that
this should
have been about
0.4 pound
per 1,000 British
thermal
units per hour.
Taking
the calorific
value of gasoline
at the
round number
of 20,400 British
thermal
units per pound
and the consumption
of the more efficient
water
jacketed
engines
as one-half
pound per hour per horsepower,
the heat. supplied
per hour per horsepower l:s 10,200 ]_ritish
thermal
units,
of which 15 per cent, or 1,530
British
thermal
units
per hour
must be dissipated
by the jackets.
This quantity
with the constant
of 0.4 pound per 1,000 British
thermal
unit ho_rs
would
make
the radiator
weight
0.61 pound,
per horsepower
of engine.
Comparing
this with the radiator
weight
of the
61.6 horsepower
Green
(British)
engine,
winner
of the Alexander
prize
competition,
which
had a total weight
of 46.9 pounds,
the
actual
unit weight
of radiator
and connections
becomes
0.76 pound
per horsepower
of engine,
a fairly good check,
considering
the wide
differences
of design
and circumstances.
Winkler
puts
radiator
weight between
0.40 and 0.55 pound per horsepower.
It is perfectly
well known-how
fhndamentally
dependent
on the
flow conditions
of the air, on the air side, and on the presence
of air or
steam
bubbles,
on the water side, is the coefficient
of heat transmission for such apparatus
as radiators,
and yet this subject
has scarcely

208

AERONAUTICS.

been touched
as a research
problem,
especiall_
when it is considered
that
the mean
temperature
difference,
another
prime
variable,
is
itself
subject
to considerable
control.
This will account
for such
differences
in radiator
weights
as exist and is responsible
for the
belief that
very material
reductions
may be expected
in radiator
weights
following
proper
research
or arrangements
for securing
rates
of heat transmission
and on thin noncorrosive
metal
inclosures.
Water
weights
are, of course,
directly
under control
of the designer
within certain
limits,
as the jacket spaces may be long or short, wide
or narrow,
pipes short and small or long and wide, and the water space
in the radiator
itself, almost
anything.
In the same 61.6 horsepower
Green engine, winner
of the Ah xander
prize, the whole water
weight
was 34.1 pounds,
or 0.56 pound
per engine horsepower
less than the
radiator
weights.
Winkler
places
this between
0.2 and 0.3 pound
per horsepower.
Other
values
for different
engines
are given
in
Tal_le II to show the order of the magnitude
of this factor.
Ianks
for gasoline
and oil will weigh more for large than for small
supplies,
but not in proportion
to their volumes,
as shape, thickness,
and kind of material
will determine
the square feet of metal and weight
of the tank per cubic foot of capacity
as much as the volume.
Other
things being equal, that shape of tank _ ill weigh least that has least
weig]_t oer cubic foo_ of volume,
and cylindrical
tanks
are most
economi'cal
of metal weight, needing
no stays, so the ratio of length
to diameter
is an important
Iactor,
which, however,
also affects wind
resistance,
but these variations
are not of such an order of magnitude
to warrant
detailed
study here.
The above-noted
Green engine,
61.6
horsepower,
and a gasol;ne
tank of 70 gallons weighing
39.7 pounds,
and a lubricating-off
tank of 6 gallons weighing
9.2 pounds,
so that
the net weights
are, gasoline
tank
0.65 pound
and oil tank
0.015
pound per engine horsepower,
or 0.57 pound per gallon for 70 gallons
and 1.54 pounds
per gallon
for 6 gallons.
Bendemann
gives the
round number
of 0.2 pound
tank weight
per_ound
of gasoline
or oil,
which does not check the above
figures,
lanks
used in tests,
he
writes,
are frequently
too light for actual
service,
which indicates
a
necessity
for standardizing
tank-metal
thickness,
shape, and to some
extent
size, as large capacity
may be just as well carried
in several
small tanks
as in one large one and with better
weight
distribution
on the frame,
as well as affording
a measure
of safety.
Gasoline
consumption
for the better
water-jacketed
engines
averages very closely 0.5 pound per hour _,(_r brake horsepower
(B. H. P.),
and for the rotating-cylinder
air-cooled
engines
about
0.8 pound
for
full load, though,
as mi_,ht be expected,
there are quite wide variations
with type of engine
and its condition
as to cleanliness,
adjustment,
load, and speed.
There is practically
no data available
on the rise
of consumption
with poor a(ljustn_cnt
of carburetor,
ignition,
leaky
valves
or pistons,
gumming
bearings,
carbonized
combustion
chamber, or even at speeds other than lmrmal,
or throttle
positions
other
than wide open.
It is not possible
from test data to even approximate the gasoline
consumption
of an acre engine in actual flight service, though, judging
from data on other classes of gasoline
en_nes,
it
mtl:.y easily be double this bcs_ value obtained
by perfectly
tuned new
en_mes
in competitive
tests.
We have mal_y figures on total consumDtiou
of gasoline
and oil during
competit.ion
flights,
but horsep_)wc'r of course was not determine([,
a_(1 such figures must be tom-

AERO_TAUTICS°

209

pared
with each other
to give a true picture
of range
of possible
variation.
Even
here, however,
the operators
are skilled
and on
their mettle,
so they may be expected
to better
ordinary
everyday
flight
consumption.
These
engl"ne-test
figures
may
be translated
into thermal
ciTiciency approximately
by taking
the average
calorific
value of American
gasoline
at 20,400 British
thermal
units per pound,
making
the engine
heat
consumption
for the two typical
classes
10,200
British
thermal
units
and 16,320 British
thermal
units per
hour
per brake
horsepower,
equivalent
to _=25
per cent and
_ 45 = 15 6 per cent thermal
efficiency
referred
to brake horsepower.
Wit_
the "actual consumption
of the Benz engine
of 0.472 pound,
Bendemann
reports
a thermal
efficiency of 29 per cent, which reqmres_
that the gasoline
used have a calorific value of 18,900 British
thermal
units per-lb.,
which is the value used by Giildner
for European
gasolines.
Other figures indicate
about an equivalent
difference
between
the American
and European
fuels which could be accounted
for by
the prevalence
of para_ns
and olefins, respectively,
in each, even if
of equal density.
Such a thermal
efficiency
as this high value istruly
remarkable,
and under
the condition
of operation
and size ot aero engines
can
hardly
be bettered,
judging
from other experiences
and from fundamental
conditions
to be examined
later, but the low value is too low
to be tolerated
without
adequate
compensatin_
advantages
in engine
weights
for short
flights
and in the reliabldty
and
adaptabuity
factors.
Actual
test values for specific engines and tests are reported
in the appendix
and need not be detailed here, but attention
is again
called to the practical
importance
of consumption
data on oth(r t_han
these best conditions
to show not only how high it may be in service,
but also how sensitive
it is to each individual
adjustment
and operatin_ condition
that may exert an influence.
_Oil consumption
is a thing that seems to follow no p.articular
law,
however
much
may
be known
about
contributory
c_rcumstances,
such as chemical
character,
viscosity,
mode of application,
surface
speed, pressure
and temperature,
air evaporation,
combustion
chamber car'bonization
and cracking,

Beyond
the more
or less general
adoption
of castor
oil to avoid
gasohne
absorption
in the crank
cases
of rotating-cylinder
aero
engines,
and t'he use of most widely
different
systems
of feed and bearin_
conditions,
this is a practically
wide-open
field of research.
In all
the competition
tests the oil consumption
has been made a subject
of measurement,
but no analysis
of causes of consumption
has been
made, nor are there an_r data on the relative
consumptmn
of different
oils or of different
oiling systems
for a given
engine.
The_ figures
must be taken for no more than they really represent,
viz, what was
used, but it can be assumed
that they are no guide whatever
to the
oil that will be consumed
in actual serwce,
except when consumption
is fixed by a pump plunger
displacement.
Nor do these figures aid
in fixing t_he least value attainable
after proper
thorough
research
on
the lubrication
of a given engine,
whicl_ is rather
more a matter
of
reliability
and engine
life than
of oil weight
to be carried.
In the
German
tests values were found
ranging
from 0.009 pound
to 0.089

pound
per hour per brake
horsepower
for the water-cooled
engines
and from 0.145 to 0.253 pound per hour per brake horsepower
for the
rotating
air-cooled
cylinder
engines.
The only conclusions
derivable
from these figures are that there is a very wide variation--about
25
to 1--proving
the need of study,
and that on the whole the rotating
air-cooled
cylinders
are much
greater
oil consumers
than
the fixed
water cooled.
The aggregate
weight
of all the units of the power plant,
engine,
engine
accessories,
and supplies
can be represented
algebraically
or
graphically
with every element
involved
m correct
relative
magnitude.
Allof
these weights
are constants
for each engine, except
the
gasoline
and oil weights,
which
are products
of consumption
per
hour and the length of the run.
Accordingly,
the graphic
representation will be a series of straight
lines or o_f the aggregate,
a single
straight
line.
Algebraically
the equation
of that line will contain
two constants,
each of which is the sum of similar constants,
one representing
intercepts
on the axis of zero time and the other slopes.
In order to keep the various
elements
of the aggregate
weight distract
and to bring out clearly the big factors of weight of engine proper
and
of gasoline
weights,
it is desirable
that the excellent
arrangement
of
a single line for each engine used by Bcndemaunin
the second German
report be supplemented
by a general
stants and a table of vMues for each
an equation
will have the following

In any machine
the process
is of superior
importance
to the mechanism as the latter
is but one of many possible
means for the execution of the former,
and however
necessary
it may be to have the
mechanism
adapted
in form, proportion,
arrangement,
and materials,
to its objective
process,
success
of the machine
is fundamentally
dependent
on the process
itself.
Most machine
processes
are really
combinations
of a series of separate
individual
process
steps working
together,
just as the mechanism
parts
themselves
coact,
and these
processes
are commonly
said to be similar
when they consist
of the
same partial steps executed
in the same order as a series, and machines
executing
them are regarded
as belonging
to the same class, or as
similar
machines.
There
are, however,
very great
differences
to be
found in these similar machines
which,
therefore,
may be vastly
dissimilar
from other standpoints.
In the first place the process
steps
may differ widely
in degree though
being identical
in kind,
and this
difference
in degree may be in turn responsible
for very considerable
differences
in mechanism.
No better
illustration
is available
than
the common
piston steam engine in which one basic step is expansion
of steam
after
admission
and before
exhaust,
yet experience
has
developed
a whole succession
of valves and valve gears, some adapted
to moderate
and others to high expansion
ratios,
while expansion
to
pressures
below atmosphere
immediately
calls for the condenser
with
its elaborate
series of auxiliary
appliances
and pumps.
Differences
in
mechanism
may be almost
infinite
even though
the same process
is
executed,
and to the same degree,
and the steam
engine will again
serve as an illustration.
Such differences
may be significant
or not.
They must
be regarded
as significant
when some good purpose
is
served
whether
the differences
are those of detail parts form such as
the shape
of a piston;
of arrangement
of the same typical
parts,
such as the locomotive
engine
as compared
with that of the steamship;
of proportion
of parts,
as diameter
of cylinder
or thickness
of
wall;
or of material.
Such differences
as are now accepted
and well
219

220

AERONAUTICS.

understood
in the steam-engine
field can all be analyzed
into significant
or indifferent
from
the standpoint
of service
requirements.
These service
requirements
require
years of experience
to be appreciated to a degree that permits
of a reduction
to standards
of practice
in arrangement,
form, proportions,
and materials
of the mechanism
and its parts.
Even
after
the establishment
of such
experience
standards
of practice
for machines
performing
a definite
fixcdservice
there will always remain
very considerable
differences
of the indifferent or nonessential
order.
Acro engines,
while belonging
to the now large
and established
class of internal-combustion
engines,
and to the smaller
fairly welldeveloped
subclass
of the gasoline
carburetor
internal-combustion
engine, in which the farm, automobile,
and boat types are most fully
developed,
are themselves
still struggling
through
the development
stage, due to the youth of tile special service to be performed,
and in
spite of all that might be borrowed
from the older most similar
arts.
In fact there is some evidence
that
these older arts have exerted
a
distinct
retarding
influence
even where assistance
might be expected,
because
borrowing
is the easiest
mode
of acquisition.
It is not
unnatural
to find automobile
practice
being adopted
for aero engines,
_hcn
it is not yet clear that there is anything
required
of the aero
engine sufficiently
different
from what the automobile
or boat engine
can supply,
to make the latter unsuitable
for the service of the former.
At the same time there is equally strong
evidence
that in some respect
the differences
in service
requirements
have
been exaggerated
or
misinterpreted
with the result that totally
different
engines were produced unlike anything
before built, and yet just as unsuitable
as the
borrowed
auto or boat engine.
In proportion
as service
requirements
on the one hand
become
better
understood,
and as engine
capabilities
or limitations,
on the
other hand,
are recognized
and utilized,
so will the aero engine as a
type come into full growth.
Review
of the engines so far proposed,
built,
and tried
out, indicates
a strong
trend
in some
directions,
but just
as surely
proves
that
in most
essentials
the period
of
blind
grasping
at every
possibility
whether
rationally
defensible
or not,'has
not yet come to an end.
The most hopeful
sign of progress
is the now general
recognition
that no older t)_pe of engine can be
borrowed
bodily for aero service,
and following
this, the large number
of suggestions
for modification
that
have been and are now being
made, some rational,
derived
through
reasoning
from fact data, but
often
without
any recommendation
other
than
mere
purposeless
difference.
Most of the rational
development
so far accomplished
has been
devoted
to forms
of the type
parts,
to their grouping
or general
arrangement,
and to special
materials
for their construction,
rather
than to the processes
that are fundamental
to the gasoline
carburetor
type of internal
combustion
engine.
Aero-engine
designers
being so
intensely
absorbed
in the problems
of arrangement
of parts,
adaptation of form of parts, reduction
of metal thickness
and application
of
materials
of high elastic
limit or low specific
gravity,
have in some
instances,
though
fortunately
not all, been diverted
from thought
of
the process
steps to be executed,
in kind and degree.
This becomes
clear by comparisons,
first of nero engines with each other and second
of any one engine with the absolute
standards
of thermodynamics.

entirely
independent
of whatever
contribution
may be obtained
to the same end, from variation
of general
arrangement,
and detail
design of parts as to form or thickness
or from the
selection
of special
materials.
The processes
are comparatively
simple and easy to state,
though
a thorough
analysis
of the relative
or absolute
perfection
of execution
that
various
designers
have accomplished
through
their mechanism
would require
far more space than is available
here.
Such an analysis must moreover
be based on far more test data than have even been
made available
anywhere.
Judging
from the literature
of the subject and from some familiarity
with general
practices
not so recorded,
it can be stated
thatpractically
no work has been done except
by a
few large engine building
concerns
who keep their results
secret,
and
comparatively
speaking,
no data obtainedbearing
directly
on the
execution
of the process
steps,
and the effect of design on process,
for aero engines,
though
some interpretation
can be based on the few
overall
results
of engine
tests.
While
the details
of design
versus
process
are beyond
the scope of this report,
it is possible
even from a
statement
of the processes
and their fulfillment
conditions,
to derive

of the process
is the carburetor

the process

beyond
extraordinary
a('cidents,
and the apparatus,
me('_mnlsm,
or
equipment
must be so constructed
as to insure
the results
desired.
This is by no means easy, as will appear
from even _ superficial
analysis of conditions
,_nd possibilities.
Air must be taken from the atmosphere
through
_hich
the machine
is moving
at a high, though
not
constant
speed, a speed so high that ttl( air pressure
equiv'flent
to
the velocity,

head of the air, is quite appreciable.
With

'[his might be avolde[t
by suitably
shapedentrailce
orifice, the plane of which is in the direct.ion of flight, but this is no safeguard
when turning
or in side gusts.
The first requirement
of air intake
must,
therefore,
be independence
of flow of air with reference
to direction
and speed of motion.
Almospheric air varies in absolute
pressure
with altitude
and likewise
varies
m temperature,
in water vaporized,
and suspended
water such as fog
or rain.
E_ch
of these things

influence
on carburetion.
Temperature,
pressure,
and moisture
affect
air density
and hence
the flow through
the air orifice under a given
pressure
drop.
Temperature
affects the vapor pressure
of the gasoline.
(Absolute
pressure
affects
air flow itself
independent
of the
density
change.)
Vaporized
moisture
affects
the accumulation
of
water
in the mixture
passages
due to reduction
of temperature
incident
to gasoline
vaporization,
and both
vaporized
and suspended
moisture
affect the accumulation
of ice in the mixturepassages,
unless
heat be added in sufficient
degree.
These things need hardly be stated
to be accepted
as fundamentally
important
and as necessary
elements
for incorporation
directly
or indirectly
into specifications
"for the air
supply
to the carburetor.
The carburetor
action
should
be made
quite independent
of these variables
and it must be sufficiently
independent
to prevent
changes
of mixture
quality
beyond
the allowable
working
range.
Therefore,
however
great a variation
may be encountered during
actual
flight, in direction
and velocity
of flight or wind,
in barometric
pressure,
in atmospheric
temperature,
in atmospheric
moisture
vaporized
or suspendedas
well, the mixture
quality
must
be kept within
the two limits to be determined
as necessary
to continued
engine performance.
Gasoline
must be carried in a closed tank and must be fed to the carburetor
through
a pipe, and the supply
to the carburetor
should be
quite
independent
of the direction
and anagle of inclination
of the
whole structure.
It positively
must be unanected
by such changes
of
relative
position
of tank and carburetor,
as may be due to not only ordinary but even extraordinary
or emergency
turning,
gliding, climbing,
or temporary
falling movements
of thewhoIe
machine.
If the machine
should
completely
fall and upset,
the gasoline
should
be prevented
from running
out on the hot exhaust
pl_pe as this is likely to cause a
fire.
Gravity
feed from tank
to carburetor
is affected,
as to head,
by every variation
in angle and direction
of inclination
of the frame.
Gravity
feed tanks must have an air vent and so if overturned
the
vent becomes
a spill hole uldess a special check feature
be added.
In
stationary
plants gravity
feed from supply
tanks is forbidden
by tile
fire underwriters'
regulations
because
of the possihility
of (h'ainaue
of
the whole tank due to a leak in any part of the pipe system.

If reasonably
high pressures
are used in comparison
with the normal
static gasoline
head, the delivery
pressure
will be substantially
constant
at all inclination
angles
and spilling

to the small carburetor

This system
is in quite

use in auto practice.
Pump feed from a main depressed

this to its service requirements,

with a closed main
tank if slightly
modified
and in the event
of a
leaky pipe no loss or fire can occur because
instead
of gasoline
escaping air flows in, doing no harm if the leak is small, but stopping
the
su_)ly
without
loss if the leak is large.
1he extraordinary
changes
of motion
in direction
and speed, both
horizontall_
and vertically,
peculiar
to the aeroplane
introduce
liquid
inertia
ann centrifugal
pressures
which
may
accelerate
or retard
gasoline
flow by raising
or lowering
the pressure
at the point of delivery to the
carburetor.
This is a peculiarity
of the aero-engine
service
conditions
which
requires
special
attention.
To cover
all
these
influences
an additional
specification
may be added
for the
carburation
system;
the fuel tank,
piping,
and supply
system
must
deliver
fuel to the carburetor
at pressures
that do not vary enough
to cause the mixture
quality
to vary be_ ond the limits required
for
the proper
steady
operation
of the engi_ne regardless
of angularity
of the machine
or of changes
of its motion
as to direction
or velocit:_,
and they must be such as to prevent
fuel loss from small leaks and
to minimize
any spilling when overturned,
preventing
whatever
spills
touching
hot parts
or reaching
electric
sparks.
References
to the
literature
are made for actu_
tank
arrangements
which
require
no
comment
here except
the approval
of the practice
of using more than
one tank and especially
of installing
a smaU emergency
reserve tank
hohling
enough
to insure a safe landing
after main tanks
are empty.
When supplied
with atmospheric
air and with fuel under
pressure
or static head, the carburetor
mechanism
is supposed
to make aproper
explosive
mixture
and through
intake
header
and branches
to deliver
to each of the several
inlet valves identical
charges
of that mixture
equal in quality, and quantity. _ .. This is su. ppose(l
to•
happ en rec, rd-,
a
less of the total quantity
of mixture
required
by the engine load or
speed and regardless
of any variation
in air temperature,
pr(ssure,
moisture,
direction,
and velocity
of flight or fuel delivery
pressure.
The possibilities
of success
in attaining
this mixture-making
ideal
must,
of course,
depend
on the definition
of proper
mixture,
for in
this is to be found
the allowable
range
of variation
from absolute
constancy
of quality.
Mixtures
that enter the c_ linder with too much gasoline
for the air
to support
in combustion
_'ill not be explosive
if the vaporized
fuel
excess is large enough
and with such mixtures
the engine is inoperative.
Long before
such
a great
fuel excess
as this is reached
the
engine
may be operative
yet operate
badly.
It is clear that
any
excess
vaporized
gasoline
in the mixture
can not burn,
so it will
decompose
or carbonize,
depositing
carbon
all over the combustion
chamber,
including
spark plugs and piston head, and show in exhaust
as smoke.
Such a mixture
will be operative
for a time, such time as
it takes for the carbon
to accumulate
in layers thick enough
to glow
on hot spots, such as piston
heads, causing
back fires or preigm_tion
and possibly
short
circuits
and miss fires from collections
on spark
plugs
if they
are so designed
as not to be self-cleaning.
Carbon
deposits
will also cause
piston
rings to stick and leak and inlpair
lubrication
when it collects
on cylinder
walls and between
rings.
To be sure, a certain
amount
of just such carbonization
can be traced
to lubricating
oil that works past pistons,
but this is an independent
matter
to be separately
treated
by oil selection
and supply
system.
Excess

part a.ud the air make a proper
mixture,
and such excess will partly
dc(.ompose
as above, but part will be dissolved
by the lubricating
oil
and defeat lubrication
besides being a dead loss.
Excess
vaporized
gasoline
in the mixture
should
be prevented,
first, to prevent
carbonization,
but also to avoid the slow combustion
that results
when the excess is too great.
A small excess gives the
highest
rate of combustion
and high rates of combustion
are necessary in acre engines
to permit
of attaining
the highest
initial cylinder
pressures
with the very high mean
piston
speeds
in use, none
of
which
are below 1,000 and some in excess of 2,000 feet per minute.
By use of pro_)erly
high compression
and more than a single point of
i_fition
a sumciently
tfigh rate of combustion
appears
to be obtainable without
resorting
to such overrich
mixtures
with their carbonizing evils and direct waste of fuel.
It may therefore
be set down as
a requirement
that mixtures
preferably
should not contain
any excess
fuel at any s_3eed and load, and positively
must not contain
enough
to cause
careen
accumulation,
measurable
fuel waste,
or interfere
with lubrication.
It goes almost
without
saying
that mixtures
of air and fuel must
be homogeneous
and uniform
throughout;
that
is, the constituents
must really be mixed.
On reaching
the cylinder
at least, no liquid
should
remain
unvaporized,
or, to use a short
word,
the mixture
should
be dry.
A correct
overall
ratio of gasoline
to air by weight
as required
for combustion
reaction
will not serve the purpose
if the
gasoline
is in liquid
form, or even if it is vaporized,
but all concentrated
in one corner of the combustion
chamber
with pure air in some
other corner,
such as is sure to happen
with direct injection
or with
more unvaporized
liquid
admitted
past the inlet valve than can be
vaporized
while entering.
Such nonhomogeneous
and wet mixtures
will both
carbonize
and cut lubrication
even if total weights
are
correctly
related,
so the second
and third requirements
of mixture
must be homogeneity,
and dryness
at least after admission.
Other
things
being
equal,
a cool mixture
carries
more heat
per
cubic foot and hence more work capacity
than a hot mixture
of the
same fuel and air.
But with liquidfuel,
mixtures
that are too cold
are no mixtures
at all, any more than a brook running
through
the
country
can be said to be mixed
with the atmosphere,
though
rain
by a stretch
of the imagination
might be, and a fog really is, though
not so intimate
a mixture
as vat_orized
moisture.
Any gasoline-art,
kerosene-air,
benzol-air,
or alCohol-air
mixture,
in combining
proportions
may be dried
if the temperature
be high enough
and the
temperature
required
will be least
for the fuels of greatest
vapor
pressure
of their heaviest
constituent
if they are solutions
of heavy
and lightparts,
as is the case with the petroleum
distillates.
For
any one Iuel the required
drying
temperature
is least
the more
intimately
the air an(1 fuel are mingled
or stirred,
so that any fuel
particle
_;ill be required
to exert only the partial
pressure
of the va!_oc
in the final mixture,
instead
of the full mixture
pressure
of one atmosphere
that
is necessary
without
true
mixing.
Mixtures
should,
therefore,
be as cool as possible
consistent
with dryness
and the maximum
permissible
moisture
is that which will vaporize
on entrance.
The higher
the mixture
pressure
the greater
the work capacity
of
the charze,
so that
everything
that
contributes
to such
must
be
promotc(l'
as much as the preparation
of cool and otherwise
proper

mixtures.
This means in effect that the pressure
drop between
the
air and the cylinder
must be a minimum,
but this is entirely
a question
of _roportions
of l]assages.
_inally
with reIerence
to mixture
quality
there can not be much
excess air, preferably
none.
Of course, excess air can not cause carbonization
or lubrication
trouble;
in fact, it exerts a beneficial
influence tending
to burn
accumulated
hot carbon
or lubricating
oil
vapor,
and it permits
of a somewhat
higher
compression
w]]ich
imp)roves
econo-m_.
But
all
the
exi)losive
mixtuYes
of hydrocarbon
vapors
ann air become
nonexplosive
in ratios
very close to
the combining
proportions
on the excess-air
side, and wi'th even a
slight
air excess
the rate of combustion
becomes
prohibitively
low.
Summarizing
mixture-quality
requirements,
a mixture
is proper when
it has the least and preferably
no excess of e_t.hcr air or i_uel, when it
is homogeneous,
when it is dry after entrance
and as cool as possibly
consistent
with homogeneity
and dryness,
and when it is supplied
at the maximum
absohte
pressure.
To produce
such mixtures
is
the function
of the carburetor.
Carburetor
mechanisms
capable
of making
mixtures
of such
specifed
quality
under
the previousL
noted
conditions
of air and
fuel supply
are practically
nonexisten't
at present,
and improvement
can hardlv
be expected
so long as carburetor
production
remains
a separatd
business,
and _purchasers
buy on name instead
of on performance,
as is the practice,
selling on name only, at present
in the
motor-car
and motor-boat
industries.
Not
until
the
acre-engine
producer
develops
carburetor
specifications
in terms
of mixtures
produced
and testing
appliances
to prove fulfillment
and to h)cato
causes of nonfulfillment
of each separate
requirement
can the needed
mixture-making
carburetor
be obtained.
Under
these conditions
it
matters
very little whether
the nero-engine
builder
makes
his own,
or buys on guaranty
of I_erformance,
independent
of engine operation.
Very great
progress nas been made in recent
years
in carburetor
design for automobile
and marine
engines,
but the end has not been
reacned,
because
all data point to a failure to maintain
the quality
of
mixture
in all the specified
respects.
In some respects
the problem
is less difficult
with the acre engine than with the auto, as the former
is not subjected
to as wide a range of flow rates nor to such sudden
and frequent
changes in flow rates as arc the latter,
due to automobile
driving]n
dense traffic or over country
roads with constant
changes
of grade,
curves,
and rou_t} s_ots requiring
continuous
opening
and
closing of the throttle.
This 1act is responsible
for the general
practice among
aero engine
builders
of buying
stock
automobile
carburetoI_
on the theory
that, the service being less severe, they should
work better
on aero service;
yet such a conclusion
is not warranted.
While it is true that flow rate fluctuations
will not be so great and so
cause less variation
inproportions,
it is also true that the normal condition of flying with feed throttle
wide open or nearly
so produces
a
more
intensive
temperature
drop,
reducing
vapor
pressure
and
decreasing
the degree of gasoline
vaporization
or l_ncreasing
mixture
wetness
and condensing
or freezing
raore water.
It is also-true
that
far stronger
variations
of fuel and air supply
conditions
must
be
encountered
in air flight than in road driving.
What
is still more
significant,
however,
is the fact that the aviator
has" no such opportuaity
to make hand adjustments
as has the chauffeur,
nor are the

227

consequences
of auto-engine
stoppage
due to bad
mixture
hardly
more than annoyance,
wnile such a stoppage
of an acre engine may
mean a complete
wreck.
It can not be too strongly
stated that accept_
ance for use of standard
carburetors
on their names,
or even reputation,
is not a satisfactory
practice
for aero engines.
The'¢ should
be designed
or purchased
to dpecifications
of maintenance
of-mixture
quality
under
all variations
of working
conditions
within
possible
ranges to be met with in sel_'ice.
There
seems to be no doubt
after the years
of experience
in carburetor
construction
for automobiles
and boats
that
the gasoline
float chamber
apparatus,
with simultaneous
vacuum
flow of gasoline
and of atmospheric
air, is permanently,
established
and must be retained.
Adherin_
to t h!s principle
oi construction
as the basis of
proportioning
amt of the first st(p
in mixing,
does not prevent
the
addition
of other elements
to corr(_ct the faults inherent
ifi the simple
combination.
Mixture
proportioning
correctors
in the form of compensators
to reduce
the natural
tendency
for gasoline
to flow in
excess at high rates of _.acuum when the ratio is correct
for low, are
now aw_ilabh_ in c(msid(rable
variety
and some are fairly zood, though
even in the best there is considerable
room for improve-n_ent.
The_e
compensators
constitute
the principal
differences
between
modern
carburetors.
It is in control
of mixture
quality
in other respects
than proportioning
that carburetors
now available
are lacking;
for example,
to
render
the mixture
quality
independent
of atmospheric
changes,
fuel
supply,
pressure
fluctuations,
and above all independent
of their own
cooling
action.
This self-cooling
is due to vaporization
of gasoline,
the latent
heat
for which
lowers
the temperature
of the mixture
below that of the entering
air.
Heat must be supplied
if liquids
are
to be vaporized,
and no amount
of human
ingenuity
can overcome
this law-of
_physics.
If the latent
heat of vaporization
be supplied
from waste neat sources
for so much of the gasoline
as can vaporize
in its air supplied
at atmospheric
temperature,
then
the resulting
mixture
will nave the same temperature
as the atmosphere
and there
will be neither
vapor condensatmn
nor water freezing
on the intakes.
Such mixtures
especially
when the air is cool are not sufficiently
dry
and certainly
are variably
dry, dryness
varying
with atmospheric
tem_ perature,
q o produce
even. this much effect requires
a considerable amount
of heat from vlther
hot jacket
water
or exhaust
gases.
To get this amount
of heat into the entering
air or the mixture
it is
necessary
to observe
the laws of heat transmission
and provide
sufficient heating
surface of suitable
form.
To simply surround
the body
of the carburetor
with a water
jacket or to take the air from a short
exhaust-pipe
jacket,
which
are the only means
now in general
use,
is entirely
inadequate,
as can be proved
by simply takingthe
mixture
temperature
by a thermometer
in the intake
pipe or "by observing
the
flow through
experimental
glass headers
and
branches.
O_
course such wall heaters
will prevent
any adhering
frost, but they can
not prevent
its formation
as free snow to be drawn into the cylinders.
This problem
of mixture
making
by carburetors
is one of the most
imt_ortant
of all the elements
el the acre engine
structure
and the
carouretor
proper
its most important
apparatus,
on which much work
has been done, but more remains,
especl"ally of the adaptation
order.

(In this connection
the paper
by Dr. Karl Buchner
on carburetion,
which is one of the best, is reproduced
iu full hi the appendix.)
• Distribution
of the mixture
from
the carburetor
to the cylinder
inlet valves without
change
of quality
in transit,
and in such a way
as to !nsure a supply of mixture
of equal quallty
to each cylinder,
is a
problem
of equal importance
to that of correct
mixture
making
and
is intimately
associated
_i!th it.
If the carburetor
should
yield
correctly
proportioned
mixed
and completely
dI_ mixtures,
this distril)ut!on
header
problem
disappears,
and ally iorm of branch
pipe
will serve the purpose
in place of the long elaborat_dy
curved
headers
now in use.
Such mixtures
are too warm to. develop
the maximum
possible
mean effective
pressure.
To get the greatest
power output
per cubic foot of piston displacement
pe_" minute
requires
a temper_tm'e lo_er
than
corresponds
to comt)hte
dryness,
probably
corresponding
to just such nuantity
of moisture
as can be evaporated
during
entrance
througfl
the inlet
valve
and,
therefore,
the nero
engine header
may be expected
to carry some moisture.
Such mixtures
have a tendency
to separate
the liquid, which resists
division
equally
among
the branches,
and where
vertical
flow must
take place
there
is a tendency
for the liquid,
which always
flows
along
the walls to drop back by gravity,
to accumulate,
and then
suddenly
carry
over as a wave,
causing
a miss, especially
at lowengine
capacity.
To prevent
lagging
of liquid,
vertical
pipes must
be made so small as to produce
skin frictionforces
superior
to gravity
at the lowest
flow rates.
If this is done then, at high flow rates, a
considerable
drop in pressure
with consequent
loss of power
will
result,
unless,
as is often the case, the carburetor
is located
at the
highest
point
and the liguid
allowed
to drain
downhill
with
the
imxture
current
in largo pipes.
On reaching
a bend the liquid flowing
along the side walls always collects
on the inside as the air stream
impinges
on the outside,
while at a Y or branch
the liquid may choose
almost
any path and is quite beyond
control,
for wherever
the m__'ture velocity
is locally
least
then the liquid
concentrates
and this
point is constantly
changing.
The best that can be done is to use
long-radius
bends
and flow paths
to each cylinder
of approximately
equal
length
and curvature,
but this gives no assurance
of equal
distribution
of liquid.
The frequent
use of two carburetors
on six
cylinders
in line and eight
cyh_nders
V engines
is evidence
of an
effort to reduce this trouble.
The only absolutely
reliable
way to avoid these special headers
and
the irregular
engine action that
results
in two cylinders
ne_ er doing
quite
the same work or remaining
equally
clean,
is to completely
dry the mixture
by raising
its temperature,
accepting
the higher
temperature
and lowered
mean effective
pressure
in the interests
of
cleaiflv,
steady,
operation,
securing
shorter
simplitied
headers
and
possibly

ignition is theprime
variable in fuel consumption
per horsepower hour
and thermal effmiency, as has been demonstrated
conclusively both by
thermodynamic
analysis and experimental
data on all classes of
internal-combustion
engines.
The highest compression possible must
be obtained at all costs, and since it is the ignition temperature
of the
mixture that impose s a limit the objective of the engine designer must
be to so treat the mixture as to get the maximum compression volume
ratio and final pressure before the mixture being compressed reaches
the i_nition temperature
which is a physical constant of the mixture,
never accurately determined but probably very close to 935 F. Ttus
compression
for the best water-cooled
engine has been found to be
about 5 to 1 volumes and less for cylinder not so well cooled.
Of
course, self-ignition
before compression
is complete will occur if any
metal part, such as the exhaust valve or piston head, or a carbon
deposit, is overheated,
because this will produce a local overheating
of the charge in contact with the hot spot before the _hole mass has
reached the ignition temperature.
Prevention
of this is a matter of

engine cooling and of the internal cleanliness that comes _,[ith proper
lubrication
and carburetion.
Assumingsuch
to be properl_ cared for,
the compression
permissible
with gasoline mixtures
is fixed by the
initial temperature
of the charge.
The final temperature
varies with
the initial in a geometric ratio, as is indicated by the standard
equation for adiabatic
compression,
so a few degrees rise initially results
in several times as great a ternfinal rise.
Charge weight per cubic foot of suction must be a maximum, and
so also must the compression, if the mean effective pressure and thermal efficiency are to have the highest possible value, as they should in
acre engines,
ikll efforts in this dircction may be entirely defeated,
however, if there is any material leakage of the charge cfuring compression through valve seats or past the piston.
It is of no value to
secure maximum charge weights during suction if appreciable amounts
are afterwards
lost before the charge has a chance to do any work.
Tightness of piston depends on the p_ston rin_, on the oil film between
piston and cylinder, and on the maintenance
of shape of cylinder and
piston, neitlqer of which mab warp in any direction.
.Valve leakage
hk_wise is minimized by providing nonwarping
valve disks and seats
with strong spring loads to keep the valve tightly against its seat during
the first period of compression;
at other Umes the gas pressure itself
will suffice.
These are questions of form and materials
and will be
taken up later, but they are mentioned here because a failure means
defeat of the results of an otherwise well-executed
suction process.
Four-cycle
engines, after the suction periods, have their charges
directly in the cylinder ready for compressmn and subsequent ignition.
Two-cycle engines must put the charge through the preliminary
compression process in a precompression
chamber where the mean pressure of precompression
mustbe
added to that of suction, the sum of
the two subtracted
from the mean effective pressure of the compression and expansion
strokes
to get the net available.
Therefore,
assuming equal performance of the compression and expansion strokes,
the two-cycle engine is charged with more negative work than the
four-cycle by the amount of the precompression
stroke, assuming
equal negative work of suction in each.
Suction heating effects on
the two-cycle arc bound to be less than in the four, because the precompression
cylinder is sure to be cooler than the working cylinder

into which the four-cycle
charge enters
directly,
and so also is clearance gas with which the fresh charge mixes, as in the two-cycle
case;
this is reexoanded

after

while in
the four-cyc_le it is hot burnt gases.
All tl_lVStwo-cycle

charge will not enter the working
cylinder
nor remain
there, for some
will remain
in the precompression
chamber
by reexpansion
or failure
of the pressure
to drop during the open-port
charging
period to atmosphere.
Some will escape ttlrough
tim exhaust
port with the exllaust
gases during
the end of tim transfer
period
when both transfer
and
exhaust
are open, regardless
of piston baffles of or special relative
positions of inlet and exhaust
ports
designed
for the purpose.
During
transfer
the fresh charge bodil_ displaces
the hot burnt
gas that fills
the motor cylinder
and its clearance,
and it is inconceivable
that
a
considerable
amount
of mingling
should not occur with corresponding
heating
and expaI_sion
effects.
These
mixture-heating
effects
are
added to those of _ all-contact
heating,
which walls in the two-cycle
engines
are always much hotter
than in the four.
The net effect is
inevitably
a discharge
of some of the fresh charge
unless special arrangements
are made to prevent
of these introduces
its own evil.
Two methods
of preventing
this
in two-cycle
engines
and consequent

fresh
loss

with the bur_t gases
this, and then each

charge

on transfer
of charge
are in use, one is

to intentionally
reduce the charge
transferred
to so small a quantity
as _ ill not escape,
and the other
to expel burnt
gases bv a ])last
of
fresh air, and then to expel this scavenging
air which,
of course,
is
cooler
than the burnt
_as, by the fresh charge.
The former
l_leans
intentionally
reduced
cnarge while the latter
more than doubles
the
negative
work
of precompression
which
in effect
is equivalent.
Some part
of the compression
stroke
in any two-cycle
engine,
so
much as is rec{uircd to cover the exhaust
port, must I:esult in further
expulsion
of enarge.
Naturally
as in four-cycle
engines,
the charge
weight
can be built ul_ in two-cycle
engines
to any value, by su_cient precompression,
nut to accomplish
this the charge
must
continue
to enter
after the exhaust
port is closed,
which
requires
an
admission
or transfer
valve
mechanic_flly
operated
and
suitably
timed,
an extra
complication.
This is not common
practice
,'rod no
data are available
on it, so for the present
it must be regarded
as
merely an interesting
possibility.
In the two cycle engines
the net effect of all heat exchanges
and
pressure
changes,
incident
to charging
the main
cylinder,
is undoubte(lly
a lower mean
effective
pressure
and th(;rmal
efficiency
than
in _four-cycle
engines,
and for equally
good design
an_[ construction
in each class the two cycle is unat_le to carry compr(ssions
as high as the four, proving
higher
temperatures
before
compression.
Any engine takl_ng its-charge
into the crank
case, as do Inost
of the rotating
cylinder
four-cycle
machines,
or into a chamber
connecting
with the main piston,
as the two-cycle
Laviator,

the point
of the return
or suction
stroke
at which
charging
will
actually
begin.
No flow can be started
from
the intake
header
until
the clyinder
pressure
is lower.
At the end of the four-cycle
exhaust
stroke
the cylinder
pressure
is higher
than atmosphere,
and
still higher
than the mixture-header
pressure
by the amount
of the
suction-header
vacuum.
Suction
can not begin until
the cvlimlcr
clearance
volume
of gases has expanded
enough
to lower the c_qindcr
pressure
(terminal
exhaust
value)
to below
that
of the I_fixture
header.
An appreciablepart
of the suction
stroke is therefore
us(qess
for actual
charging,
the loss increasing
with higher
terminal
exhaust
pressures
and lower suction-header
pressures.
A similar
condition
exists in the two-cycle
precompression
chamber;
for there
the 1)ressure at the time the transfer
to the working
c)limler
is c_)mplete
must
be something
hi__her than
atmosphere,
and
the hi,he1" the
speed the more excess t_ere must be, because
of the limite([time

This
mixture
must
expand
not
only
to
atmosphere,
but as much
below as the suction
header
or carl)ui'eter
vacuum,
even with
a mechanically
operated
valve, and still more
with the more common
spring
closed
automatic
check valve, by the
amount
of spring
tension
and vale
inertia,
before
real suctio_lcan
begin.
The clearance
in such precompression
chambers
is large, to
limit the maximum
precompression
pressure
to something
less_than
10 pounds
per square
inch, and, therefore,
the reexpansion
line will
be very fiat, cutting
off a considerable
part of the strok_
as useless
before
the pressure
has dropped
sufficl"ently
for suction
to start.
Many times the loss occurs here, as in four-cycle
cylinders
with their
smaller
clearances
and steeper
reexpansion
lines, even with
equM
pressures
at the start.
No separate
data
are obtainable
for acre engines
on any one of
these quantities
concerned
with charge weight
and the corresponding
pressure
and temperature
changes,
nor is there
any indicatl_on
that
such information
has even been sought.
Even
the over-all
effects,
as measured
by volumetric
efficiency,
have apparently
not been
investigated,
though
all that
is requircd
is a measurement
of air
and gasoline
or exhaust
gas and a comparison
with the piston
displacement,
the ratio
of volumes
constituting
the true volumetric
efficiency.
Other
things being equal, the horsepower
per cu])ic foot
of displacement
per minute
sholild
be directly
proportional
to this
volumetric
efficiency,
so it is a little surprising
that the acre interests,
which
must
have
the most
powerful
engine
per pound
of metal,
should have neglected
to separately
study
each of the prime
variables.
As already
noted,
more designers
seem to have been concerned with reduction
of metal volume
than with process
perfection,
though
without
proper
execution
of basic processes
metal
reduction
may not only fail to give a light engine,
but may even defeat
the
ultimate
object
by making
the engine
as structurally
weak as it is
weak in mean effective
pressure
or thermal
efficiency.
It must not
be understood
that
no good performance
reslflts
based
on proper
execution
of the processes
have been obtained;
in fact,
there
are
some most remarkable
successes;
but, on the other hand,
these stand

This treatment
consists
in compression

if the combustion

is confined
to

a suiticiently
small crank angle at the inner dead center when

to take this

fl_m(; would hay(, to travel more than a radius to burn all the mixture,
a_d vet two ._uch plugs seem to give a quicker
combustion
than the
one _,t the center,
instead
of slower.
This question
of combustion
rate v( t'sus sp_lrk plug location
and number.is
still pretty
well open,
though
clearly of considerable
importance
in securing
proper
combusti_)n lines'for
most effective
working.
Reliability
should
also be
served
as there
is a better
chance
of avoiding
failure
with two indepen(tent
magnetos
and two sets of spark
plugs than
one, and this
inu(:h has been established
as good practice,
but accurate
simultaneous sparking
of both plugs is absolutely
necessary.
There
are two considerations
that bear on the question,
both
of
which
require
definite
investigation.
In the first place
it is the
volumetric
rate
of combustion
that
is of primary
importance,
not
the linear rate.
It is clear that a _reater
volume
of ml'xture
will be
bun_t with a fixed linear rate,
if the i_nition
is at the center
of a
complete
sphere
of flame as the st_here has a greater
volume
for its
radius
than any other geometric
oody.
This would
seem to favor
central
ignition,
but as the normal
acre engine combustion
chamber
with head valves is a short
cylinder
in which the axis is short
comared with the diameter,
ignition
at the center will burn in the first
alf of the total time a mixture
volume
proportional
to the area of a
circle of half the bore, while during
the second half the circular
ring
between
this circle and the cylinder
wall will burn and this ring has
three times the area and volume
of the center
cylinder.
Therefore,
with central
ignition,
the volumetric
rate is low at first, and high

This advance,

because

inertia pounds per

_TaN_r' and taking a = 0.5, cap

culated from the weight distribution
figures giv('n by Winkler, the
speed at which this would become equal to 350 polmds per square
inch is 2,640 revolutions

per minute.

(NOTE.--

ll" = pounds

recip-

(l

rocating
weight per square inchpiston,
N = revolution per minute,
r = radius of crank in feet..)
The rotating
cylinder engine introduces a different condition, for here the reciprocating
parts always
exert a centrifugal
force varying from a maximum at out center to
a minimum
at tuner center and such as will keep the connecting
rods always in tension if speed and recii_rocating weights are l:_rg5
enough to develop centrifugal
forces higher than the gas pressure,
the maximum
for which is found at 250 pounds per square inch
norlTlal.

From this standpoint
the operating speed or high limit is fixed
by the weight of.reciprocating
parts, and the normal maximum gas
pressur(is , and this is the controlling factor so long as mean effective
pressur(s
do not fall off materially
with speed.
Examination
of
any horsepower-speed
curve will show it to have a straight line
form up to some critical value which is easily determined
by test,
thouzh
no authentic
curves are available
,or acre engines.
Of
cour_Ye, this critical speed must be beyond the operating range and
is a second high limit to be considered in conjunction
with that imposed by inertia.
The best procedure is undoubtedly
the selection
of such proportion
of gas passages, carburetor,
and ignition conditions on the one hand, and reciprocatingparts
weights on the other,
as will bring the critical speed equal to the inertia speed limit.
Curvaturo of the horsepower-speed
curve is due partly
to increased
losses of charge at the higher speeds, and partly to insufficient rate
of combustion.
Which of these two is in any instance the controlling factor must be discovered before any plan of improvement
can
be-undertaken
and this is most directly done by plotting the volumetric efficiency-speed
curve beside the horsepower-speed
curve.
If the latter departs from the straight line before the former, it is
clearly not due to insufficient charge.
In such a case enlargement
of valves or ports, or reduction of carburetor
vacuum will not improve matters at all, as it is a low rate of combustion that is responsible for the result, to cure which attention
must be devoted
to
mixture quality and ignition.
Fuel consumption
per horsepower hour, or the equivalent
thermal
efficiency, is aIso an indication
of the overall effectiveness
of the
process execution,
and comparison
of engines on this basis can be
made from the data of Table V, selected from the test reports.
These would tell more if divisible into the factors
as indicated in
considering the mean effective pressure.

nothing
short of wonderful
for such high-speed
engines,
and judging

250
by the performance
d_-mmfics of limiting

AEaO_AUTICS.
of other classes of engines
and by the
possibilities,
little more can be expe(_ted.

thermoWhat

n_u._t be sought
for here
is, therefore,
_ot an improvement
of the
best, but a general
raising
of the poorer
ones to lex el of the best,
and the maintenance
of the high test value in actual-service
flight.
In this prime factor,
as in that of mean effective
:pressure,
the fixed
water-cooled
cylinder
has a demonstrated
superiority,
while the least
favorable
is the rotating
air-cooled.
The difference
between
the
best and worst is ver.y large indeed.
Comparison
of engine
results
with each other, especially
when it
is not possible
to divide ovcrall results
into contributing
factors,
can
ire no information
as to how far it may be possible
to further
imgrove
engines.
It merely
indicates
which
is the better,
and may
throw some light on t_po availability,
as, for example,
the fuel consmnption
of t_vo-cyole'engines
must
always
be greater
than fourcycle,
if each is equally
well designed;
or again,
air-cooled
engines
may or may not have as high a mean effective
pressure
as watercooled.
Thermodynamic
standards
of comparison
do indicate
goodness
more absolutely,
and these are now in general use iu engineering
practice.
Accountmg
for and
eliminating
operative
conditions,
such
absolute
standards
illuminate
the goodness
of the machine
with reference to the execution
of its basle process.
Such, for example,
is the
case with steam turbines,
the performance
of which is compared
with
that of the Rankine
cycle as a sta_ldard,
for equal initial and terminal
conditions
of pressure,
temperature,
and steam
quality.
It is also
the case with internal-combustion
engines
of the classes that
have
really
been
subjected
to any reasonable
degree
of investigation
_hich
are judged
by the Otto and Dieselgas
cycles.
But the aero
engine
has not as yet been so studied.
According
to this method
equations
are derived
from a study
of the ideal Otto gas cffcle for
thermal
efficiency
and mean effective
pressure.
Thermal
emciency,
for example,
referred
to indicated
horsepower
is found to be a function
of the amount
of compression
only, ana given b_ the following
equation, in which the subscript
(b) refers to the condition
after, and (a) to
that before, compression:
{ I'_\_I
-

.

{P_\_---_ .

Ta

Comparing
this with the thermal
efficiency
of a_ engine of known
compression
results
in an efficiency
ratio,
and in Table VI are _iven
some values for aero engines,
computed
with what data are avauable
and certain
assumptions
noted.
As the fuel consumption
per brake
horsepower-hour
is the only experimental
quantity
beside
the compressrun,
the factor includes
all losses, both mechanical
and thermal,
which former should really be separated
out.
Similarly,
mean effective
pressure
can be shown thermodynamically
to be not only a function
of compression,
as is efficiency,
but also of the
calorific
value of the mixture,
tile negative
work a_l(l suction
heating

These figures,
which should throw
so much light on performance,
are, as a matter
of fact, of but httle
value because
of the absence
of accurate
data, especially
on compression
and engine friction,
both
mechanical
and fired.
They
are, however,
given
to illustrate
the
method
of judging
by thermodynamic
standards
rather
than
by
simple
comparison
of engines
one with
the other, in the hope that
in future
tests such data will be obtained
as to make possible
the
determination
of both diagram
factors
and thermal
efficiency
ratios.
Continuity
of the operation
of mixture
treatment
in the cylinder
is dependent
on the maintenance
of a steady
state as to temperature
of the metal
parts,
and this is possible
only by a cooling
system
of
considerable
complexity
from the thermal
standpoint,
however
simple the apparatus
may seem, superficially
examined.
Cooling
for
the maintenance
of a steady
state of temperature
in the metal
parts
is not of itself sufficient,
as the parts must be held to a low limit of
temperature,
which requires
a definite heat conducting
and dissipating
capacity
in proportion
to the heat
receiving
capacity
of the part.
This limit of allowable
temperature
is imposed
not only by the requi_:emcnts
of the charging
and compression
functions
but is necessar3 for other reasons.
If metal
parts become
too hot oxidation
sets
in, stiffness
is reduced,
and deformation,
both
the temporary
sort
resulting
from
expansion
and the permanent
sort due to molecular
rearrangements,
becomes
troublesome.
Cylinder
lubrication
is also
dependent
on the temperature
of the metal surfaces,
of piston
barrel
exterior
and cylinder
interior,
which, if too high, prevents
any oil
remaining
without
destructive
distillation
or carbonization,
or
imI)airs
its lubricating
value by excessive
reduction
of viscosity.
kieat is received
by all metal
parts in contact
with the hot gases
and these parts include
the cylinder
head, inlet and exhaust
valves,
the walls of any valve, pockets,
the ig'niter plug, the piston head, and
the _ hole interior
of the c 3 linder wall exposedat
the end of the outstroke.
The heat received
by the cyhnder
proper
is greatest
for the
part exposed
during
the first part of expansion
just following
explosion, and extremely
hot gases are in contact
with the whole interior
of the clearance
space.
In addition,
heat is given up by burnt
gases
escaping
through
the exhaust
valve and ports
to the valve and its
stem to the stem ,lg_,)des, port walls, and connecting
parts of the cylinder head or the side pocket that carries the exhaust
valve.
Heat
received
from
hot gases must
be conducted
through
the
metal by more or less devious
and rarely straight
paths to the external
surfaces
of the metal walls from which heat maybe
abstracted.
The
first means of abstraction
from the exterior
faces of the walls is air in
motion,
induced
or driven by a fan which may be separate,
or the propcUer itself.
In some cases the free air moving past with the velocity
of flight is rehed
upon,
but the most unique
arrangement
is that
of the rotating
cylinder
cooperating
with
the free air movement.
The second means of abstraction
is water or oil, or in general
a liquid
circulated
by a pump,
first over the heat receiving
walls and then
through
the radiator
where
the free air again takes
it up with or
without
the assistance
of a fan.
A third method,
as yet used in very
few acre engines,
though
frequently
used elsewhere,
is the boiling
water jacket,
noncirculatting,
with an air cooled steam condenser
and
condensate
return.
In any case the ultimate
disposition
of the heat
is to the free air, and when liquids
are interposed
as carriers
it is with

the idea that somegoodresultswill follow what appears be at

Whenever eat is to passbetween fluid anda body of metal,

a secon(tiquid film on the insideof the radiator, jacket, or water
l
pipe walls,
and finally
a second
gas film on the outside
of radiator
jacket
or pipe.
Each
of these elements
of the heat path
exerts
a
thermal
resistance
to heat flow, and the resistance
of tim whole path
is the sum of the separate
resistances.
Heat flows according
to _ law similar
to Ohm's law for electricity,
inasmuch
as the flow varies directly
with the difference
of potentlal
or temperature,
and inversely
as the resistance.
Therefore.
o_er
any complex
path, consisting
of several parts each of different
'resistance series as the same quantity
of heat is passing
through
all. the
whole
temperature
drop is divisible
into partial
temperature
drops
in the proportion
of the partial
resistance
to the whole resistance.
The resistance
of any one part of the _path is inversely
proportional
to the conductivity
of the substance,
is directly
proportional
to the
length
of path in the direction
of heat flow, and is reversely
as the
cross section
of path
at right angle to the heat flow.
Accordingly
the telnperature
drop through
a gas fihn is almost
a thousand
times
as great
as through
a metal
wall of equal thickness,
and the drop
through
a liquid
tihn also of the same thickness
would
be about
ten
times
that
through
the metal.
Gas film thic-l_esses
and thermal
resistances
on the interior
of the combustion
chamber,
because
of
lack of circulation
there, nmst be fairly thick and so highly resistant.
These
interior
gas film resistances
n;ust

than
the
air films on the exterior
where air is })lasted over surfaces
and very
much more in turn than the resistance
of fihns of liquids
eirculatins
over those
exterior
surfaces.
Of all the temperature
(h'(,1)s , })y a_
odds the least is that through
the thin cylinder
walls when the flow
is direct.
The object of the design of the coolin_
system
is to keep the interior metal
walls as cool as possible,
anti these walls will be cool in
proportion
as the thermal
resistance
of the heat flow path is greatest
on the side of heat reception
and in proportion
as the resistance

the outside
is small and the heat flow path through
the metal short,
or in the event
of this being impossible
then of equivalently
larger
cross section.
By reason of the fact that they normally
work at or nearly
at full
power
and at such high speeds,
aero engines
develop
more heat per
square
inch of wall interior
than any other class of internal-combustion engines
of the same bore, and it is an open question
whether
cylinder bore has much, if anything,
to do with this quantity.
Cooling
must, therefore,
be more effectivelyprovided
than in any other similar engine,
so that
careful
study
of heat flow conditions
should
be
well repaid
in improved
results,
both
as to maintenance
of high
power and reliability.
While considerable
advance
has been made_n
this direction
it is more concerned
with general
system
than with
details.
The literature,
for example,
is full of controversial
matter
on air cooling
versus
water
coohng,
on the relative
merits
of air
blasted
fixed versus
rotating
cylinders,
and such matters
of general
arrangement,
but there is a general
lack of attention
to the rational
thermal
analysis
or design
of the heat flow path for control
of its
resistances
and temperature
gradients.
Cooling
of cylinder-barrel
walls is perfectly
easy by either
air or
water,
but to get air cooling
as effective
as water
the air must circulate many
times
faster
than
the water,
which
is quite
effective,
whether
it has any material
velocity
or not.
Extension
of exterior
surface is, of course,
a direct and rational
means of reducing
the necessary
air velocity
to secure a rate of heat abstraction
that will keep
the temperature
of the metal walls much nearer
to that of the circulating air than to the interior
hot gases.
Such ribbing is quite unnecsary with water
or oil in jackets
as the rate of abstraction
by this
medium
of higher
conductivity
is so high that no more abstraction
surface
is required
than that
receiving
heat
to keep the metal
at a
temperature
very close to that of the liquid.
Difficulties
of cooling begin only on the irregular
parts and increase
with
their
irregularity
or thermal
isolation
from heat
dissipators.
The first irregu-iar
element
met is the cylinder
head or side valve
pocket.
This receives
heat
over the whole
interior,
including
the
valve faces, and also from the walls of the exhaust
port.
It can not
be of uniform
metal thickness,
and by reason of valve seats and ports
the metal heat flow path can never be of uniform
length,
so it is to be
expected
that
however
uniform
in temperature
the interior
of the
smooth
cylinder
barrel may be no such condition
can apply to heads
or valve pockets.
The intake port and valve, with its stem and stem
bearing,
are coolers and need no other cooling
than is available
from
the incoming
charge, especially
when the mixture
carries some liquid
still to be vaporized.
It is this inlet self-cooling
that is responsible
in part for lowered
volumetric
efficiencies,
so the heat exchange
here
that helps in one direction
is harmful in the other.
Exhaust
ports, whether
cast in or welded to sheet metal or screwed
into machined
seats, can not be too well cooled, because
they start
at the exhaust
valve seat, at which point heat is received
on both
the port
side and combustion
chamber
side.
Exhaust
ports
also
carry
the stem
bearing
of the exhaust
valve,
which
is the only
means of disposing
of the heat received
by the valve itself on either
side.

To hold oil in sucha stembearingwithout an elementary tuffing
s
box is, of course, lmostimpossible, though
a
but
sucha device is not
use(], it should be added
to replace the present
two diameter
stems
now in use for this purpose.
It requires
on_y a casual survey
of the
illustrations
of acre engines
to see how dinerent
is the means
for
head cooling
and expeeially
that
and port walls,
and how easily,

of the exhaust
valve,
therefore,
distortion

its seat, stem
of the metal

parts
may occur,
due to unequal
expansion,
resulting
possibly
in
brcaka__cs
but certainly,
when valves
and seats are involved,
in serious lea_s which,
once started,
especially
at exhaust
valves, rapidly
increase
1)y the high erosion influences.
Probabl'v
the worst
cooled part, aside from the exhaust
valve, is
the piston_head,
which receives heat over its whole top surface,
equal
to the art's,,' of the cylinder
bore circle at least,
and more if arched
upward
,)t' dished down, as may properly
be done, especially
the former
to give it, some stiffness
and_elasticity
in thermal
expansion.
This
heat, while imparted
in small part to the crank case air, must largely
and almost
wholly be disposed
of to the cylinder
walls by a radially
outward
conduction
across the head, followed
by conduct
down the
piston
barrel,
thence
across
an oil film to the cylinder
walls.
By
hlcreasing
the metal
thickness
of the piston
head regularly
from
the ccntcr
outward
in proportion
to the square
of the radius,
its
heat carrying
capacity
could be made proportional
to the receiving
surface
above,
l'hen by suitably
thickening
the upper
barrel
the
axial heat carrying
capacity
can be made great enough
to take what
is delivered
by the outer ring of the head and conduct
it down for
the oil film to be taken
up and transferred
to cylinder
walls.
This
last transfer
is most effective
the longer
the piston
and the better
the oil film, and as it is thus disposed
of the thickness
of barrel may
be reduced.
Such
additional
piston
metal
to secure
an adequate
heat carrying
path will be least the greater
its thermal
conductivity,
and there is no reason
why suitable
carrying
capacities
should
not
result without
undue
weight.
Examination
of the illustrations
will
indicate
that apparently
the idea of most of the designers
has been
to use as thin, and uniformly
thin, metal as possible
with no thought
of heat conductivity
whatever,
though
a few give evidence
of some
grasp
of the problem.
An exception
to the overheated
piston
is
found
in the rotating
cylinder
engine that carries
its inlet valve in

clearance.
If sufficiently
cut away
to g'_ve relief,
leakage_is
promoted,
which
defeats
lubrieat.ion,
and the oil fihn,
which is an essential
part of the thermal
pat.h from piston to cylinder,
is destroyed
and overheating
accelerated.
Some little clearance,
and
more at the top than along the barrel, is necessary,
but the less the
better,
and the better the cooling of the piston
head whether
by conduction
across it and down the barrel or through
separate
conduction
bars, directly
from head center
to barrel
and to oil film, the less
clearance
will be necessary.
A photograph
is given
in a German
report
of a piston
that
failed
from overheating,
and such failures
seem
to be frequent.
There
is also shown
a burned
spark
_)lug,
which should
be cooled just as well as other
parts to prevent
exces:.
sive
temperature
rise, though
its end must
be warm
to promote
cleanliness,
but not so warm as to make an incandescent
spot, or to
cause destruction.
Cracked
cylinders
are also more
or less common
from
unequal
cooling,
and in both the German
and the British
Alexander
tests
such cases are reported.
In the latter
the fact that the cylinder
ran
11 hours
before failing
proves
the crack to be not due to any gaspressure
stress.
This unequal
cooling
or heating
may be due to
uneven
thicknesses
of metal
or to unequal
heat
abstraction,
as
would
occur
in water
jackets
with steam
or air pockets,
or to the
impact
of the air blast from the propeller
on the front side of a forward
cylinder.
Rotating
air-cooled
cylinders
and,
in fact,
even
fixed air-blasted
cylinders
can not be equally
cooled
because
it is
quite
impossible
to force equally
cool fresh
air at equal
velocity
around
the whole cylinder,
no matter
how many baffles or guides are
used,
and this inequality
must
promote
distortion.
One compensating
element
used,
that
of eccentric
ribs giving more surface
for
heat abstraction
on the side of least air activity,
is ingenious,
probably more so than
effective.
There
seems to De no hope whatever
of air cooling
ever being made as uniform
as with water,
and therefore more
distortion
effects
are certain
in air-cooled
engines
even
though,
by the use of excessive
quantities
of air and fan or windage
power,
the walls could
undoubtedly
be kept as cool as with water,
it could not be a uniform
cooling,
and hence not as desirable.
In the
German
test report
the windage
of the Gnome
rotating
cylinder
engine is given as 8 per cent of the output,
which checks
exactly
the
vaYue given
by Winkler
for the Renault

By sufficient

the delivery

On the <>ther hand, should

Not only is the oil subjected

but it must be of such character
as
will not lca_-e excessive

when it works past pistmls,
but must vaporize

It is clear that nero engine lubrication
is not only more important
as a process
than in other classes of engine with reference
to need and
consequences,
but is very
much
more
difficult
on account
of the
excessive
heating,

materials of internal

engine practice,
i. e., cast-iron

on
cast-iron
cylinders,
but is doubly difficult when steel is substituted
to
reduce metal volume,
so it is natural
to find new elements
of practice
introduced.
Crank shaft
and crank pin bearings
of nero engines
offer no more
ditliculty
on nero engines than on others,
provided
the bearing
pressures imposed
by the designer
in an effort to cut down material
are
not excessive
and providedthe
surrounding
atmosphere
is not hotter.
The necessity
for crank
cases imposed
by the presence
of dust in
the air at landing
and starting
points,
does make
the atmosphere
surrounding
these bearings
abnormally
hot, especially
when thepistons are inadequately
cooled as is more often the case than not.
This
hot atmosphere
created
by hot pistons
and conserved
by the closed
crank case naturally
raises main and cra_xk pin bearing
temperatures
to some value higher than the crank case air, fixed by the heat generated
in them by friction,
and ,so reduces
oil viscosity
correspondingly.
This would seem to be sufficient
reason for using lower bearing
pressures
or larger surfaces
than in auto engines, for example,
and this
conclusion
is reenforced
by the fac_ that the bearing

If in every cylinder
the same mean effective
pressure
were obtained,
and if all cylin[iers
weighed the same number
of pounds
per cubic foot
of displacement
per stroke,
including
their
attached
valves,
rods,
pistons,
_Tist pins, and connecting
rods, then the weight
per horsepower of engine at the same engine speed wouht depend
on the frame
and shaft weights
per cylinder
which is a result of the general arrangemcnt.
If at the same'time
the thermal
efficiency
of all engines were
the same, the added weight
of fuel and tanks
per horsepower
would
be the same for all.
Differences
in weight

and of engine,
oil, fuel, radiator,
and tanks
taken
together
are considerable,
the heaviest
being more than
twice the weight
of
the ]ightest
even for short runs, and the excess is more than this for
the longer runs.
The basic causes for such differences
can be reached
only by analysis
alon_
these lines, and such analysis
will indicate
tha't as man>: of the elements
of actual
difference
are accidental
or
incidental
as are essential
or inherent
in arrangement,
form,
proportions,
or material.
The influence
of arrangement
to be first examined
is in some cases
quite clear and in others complex.
Where, for example,
arrangement
of cylinders
in number
and position
has no effect on the limiting
speed, on the mean effective
pressure,
on thermal
efficiency,
or on the
weight
of cylinders
complete
per cubic foot of displacement
per stroke,
then the effects of arrangement
are clear,
qualitatively.
The contrarv is the case when a given arrangement

as compared
with another
also requires
heavier
cylinders,
or _S limited
to a lower speed,
or is incapable
of
any but a low mean effective
pressure,
for here the result depends
on
the degree to which one factor
compensates
another.
Differences
in arrangement

in aero

These are the two fundamental

Anzani,

waU drainage.
If this should
work at an right,
this arrangement
offers further
opportunities
for
weight reduction
over the now standard
multicrank
form.
Even here, however,
there is a limit to the number
of cylinders
that
can be radially
placed
about
one crank,
a limit
imposed
by their
intersections,
andwhile
the rotating
Gnome
uses a maximum
of nine
and a minimum
of five, the fixed Anzani
uses three
or five.
The
Anzani fig'ures for two sets of three are 50 horsepower
and 200 pounds,
or 4 pounds
per horsepower,
and for two sets of five 100 horsepower
and 330 pounds,
or 3.3 pounds
per horsepower,

of 0.7
pounds per horsepower,
or 17½ per cent, being the effect of using five

instead
of three per star, all cylinders
bem_,oe of same size.
Similarly
the effect of doubling
the number
of rows is shown by comparing
the
10-cylinder
100-horsepower
with
the
20-cylinder
200-horsepower,
botl_ having
sets of five, the former
two sets and the latter four sets.
The former
weighs 363 pounds,
and the latter 682 pounds,
the difference of 310 pounds
being the weight
added to the first 10 cylinders,
which themselves
weigh 363 pounds, and showing nearly proportionate
addition
of weight
per crank added, the actual addition
bemg 88 per
cent.
The gain is of course greater in passing from a one crank star to
a two than from two to fl)ur cranks, as might t)e expected
from the study
of cylinders
in line.
This is shown by the figures for the 3-cylinder,
30-horsepower,
121 pounds,
compared
to 6 cylinders
(two sets of
3 50-55 horsepower,
200 pounds),
the second r()w adding
79 pounds
to the first 121 pounds,
which is only 65 per cent, as compared
with 88
per cent when two rows are added to two to make four.
Increase
of cylinders
radially
about a crank always reduces
weight,
but the weight
reduction
is most when the frame and shaft weight
is
large in proportion
to c31inder weight,
and least other_vise.
Ideally
the weight
reduction
by multiplication
of cylinders
would be zero if
the shaft and frame weighed
nothing.
This is clearly shown
by the
fi__ures given by Win "lder in Table _, II for the proportionate
weight
o_ the various
parts
of fixed auto type and rotating
radial
cylinder
engines.
To these fi__ures are added some pound
values for the parts

from Win'_ler's

and assumed

These figures are most interesting,
but must be used with considerable
caution,
as the Winklcr
fractions
are general
averages
and
when
applied
to a given
engine
may give pound
values
that
are
somewtmt
in error.
One instance
of this appears
in the value obtain(_d for the magneto
in pounds
by applying
the general
average
fraction
to a given_overall
engine weight
and w-hich works out in the
table as 35 pounds
for one and 18 for another.
While of course there
really may))e
this difference,
it is not fundamental
nor is there any
acceptance
of its accuracy.
The really valuable
parts
of the table
are those items for the principal
parts,
such as cylinders,
crank case,
pistons,
and shafts.
Radial
disposition
of cylinders
does not suffer from inequality
of
oil fl.w to combustion
chambers
only when cylinders
and frames
are
rotated
about
the crank shaft,
but here the tendency
toward
headilow is increased
by the centrifugal
force on the oil, wifich
is far
greater
than pure gravitation
and which apparently
is at least a contributing
factor
to very high oil consumption
of these engines
and
their quick carbonization.
It may be that this is more an cttecv o
the use of steel and of high w_al| temperatures
than
of centrifugal
flow, as such engines
are al_ ays air cooled by reason
of the difilcult_
of making
mowng
water
joints and of controlling
water
flow witu
the centrifugal
forces
acting
in jackets
and Pipes, but everything
points
the etcher way.
Inverted
cylinders
hawing head flow tendencies between
these rotating
cylinder
engines
and the normal
vertical
must be accepted
with great
caution
at present,
though
there is at
present
no data that
warrant
a conclusmn.
Complete
radial
star
disposition
of rotating
cylinders
gives
the smallest
possible
frame
and crank
weight
per cylinder,
but it is not possible
to use some of
the cylinder
constructions
and materials
that
are perfectly
feasible
in fixed cylinders.
Centrifugal
forces put cylinders
and connecting
rods under
a tension
stress
that is pretty
large at the high speeds
used, and angular
velocity
changes
impose cylinder-bending
stresses,
due not only to their own overhang
but also to the pistons,
and
these stresses
are additional
to those imposed
by explosion
pressures.
To reduce
these
special
centrifugal
stresses
to a minimum,
the
weights
of the parts
must be the very least possible,
and this is to
be accomplished
by the use of an assuredly
sound
and high-tension
metal,
such as one of the steels.
These engines,
then, have adopted
steel as a cylinder
material
not so much from choice as of necessity,

268

AERO2CAUTICS.

and the fact that the surfaces
could be lubricated
at all has acted as
an incentive
to its substitution
for the old standard
cylinder
material,
cast iron, in the fix_ed cylinder
engines,
with corresponding
weight
reduction
per cylinder
lit that class.
'file effect of this weight
reduction
must not be exaggerated.
Steel
pistons,
for instance,
are
only 12 to 15 per cent lighter
than cast-iron
ones, since bottom
must
not be too thin on account
of the danger
of burning
through.
Furthermore,
pistons
weigh tufty about
7 per cent of the total engine
weight.
Greater
effects are possible
when steel cylinders
and sheet
ackets
are substituted
for east iron, yet. even here the gain is rather
ess than might
be expected,
because
of the heads, and the substitution is warranted
more on grounds
of assumed
soundness
of forged
rolled or (h'a_m steel compared
with cast-iron,
which mav have hidden
detects such as blow holes
cold shorts, or bad shrinkage
stresses.
In this brief review of the effects of general
arrangement
of cylinders and cranks
on the weight
per horsepower,
it was assumed
that
other factors
remained
fixed, such,
for example,
as the weight
of
cylinders
per cubic foot of displacement
per stroke.
Variations
in
details
of construction
of the cylinder
complete
with
valw, s and
valve drives, pistons,
and connecting
rods, such as might
affect this
unit weight,
are not oifly pretty
numerous
and cover a considerable
range, but taken in conjunction
with the corresponding
variations
of
material,
the resulting
unit weights
of the complete
cylinders
follow
no simple law.
A type construction
of few parts that wouhl tend to
lightness
may employ
a heavier
material
that equalizes
tile weight.
A somewhat
nmre complicated
or essentially
heavier
construction
will often be found associated
with a lighter
material,
producing
the
same result
and unit weight.
The combination
of light(,r
cons{ruction and material
together,
cooperating
to produce
low unit weight,
is _lso found,
but unfortunately
this is usually
offset by lower mean
effective
pressure
and
efficiency
or by a less favorable
general
arrangement.
The object sought is the lightest
combination
of form and material
for cylinders,
pistons,
and their
accessories
consistent
with proper
values
of the other factors
that contribute
in the same direction
to
a higher ho1-sepower
per pound
of total weight.
It seems pretty
clear that designers
and inventors
of a_.ro engines
have st'trt_'d
with some favorite
general
arrangements

or as wouhl bring

To put it otherwise,
there is no combination
o/the
various
factors
that
contril)ute
to a
low weight
per hot-sepower
ratio involving
tllo most favorable
value
of each factor.
This would

and some

with an ultimate
tensile
strength
approaching 200,000
poun(!s per square
inch, are so superior
that nothing
else
could be considered.
That other materials
are used at all is due to
the fact that the material
of some parts must have other i>ropcrties,
each contributing
to a diffcrente,, function
than that
of stress
resistance.
Piston
and cylinder
material
must
have good conductivity,
esneciallv
the former.
Pistons
and exhaust
valves
especially,
but
tosome
extent
the whole combustion
chamber,
must resist oxidation
under
high tem'peratures
and water
jackets
must
resist
hot water
corrosion.
All heated
parts
should
have the lowest
possible
coefficient
of expansion
to minimize
the thermal
stresses
of unequal
heating,
and the expansion
characteristics
of cylinder
material
with
reference
to that of the piston
should
be such as to oppose seizing
on heating.
_I he piston must heat more than the cylinder,
so cylinder mater]al
shouhl
have a higher
thermal
coefficient
of expansion
than piston
material,
though
in small cylinders
with
proper
clearance the same material
will serve but never should piston metal have
a higher
coefficient
than
cylinder
metal.
Permanent
distortion
of
metals
under
the heating
conditions
of operation
is not permissible
in cylinders,
heads, valve seats, valves, and pistons,
so some commercial alloys, including
some steels, are barred on this account.
Finally
the met;M of these two parts,
cylinder
and piston,
shouhl
have such
a molecular
structure
as wiU lubricate
well, cast iron on cast iron is
the best, cast iron on steel next best,
and steel on steel the worst
combination,
neglecting
the nonferrous
alloys which may be serviceable though
they
are as yet unknown
quantities.
This is not an
absolute
necessity
except
where
excessive
oil consumption
is more
important
than metal
weights.
Engines
intended
for short
flights,
an hour
or so, might
very properly
have piston-cylinder
materials
that i_nore
this, compensation
being
secured
by large oil consumption which
adds little weight.
But long flights will add enough
oil
_ eight to more than offset the weight
reduction
obtained
by making
both parts of steel, as compared
with both cast iron, or one of each.
About
exerv
combination
of standard
ferrous
materials
forged,
cast, drawn,
and rolled for the heated
parts
that could be produced
has t)eeu tried, and is even now in use, so it can be definitely
stated
that practice
in ferrous
materials
is not vet established,
which means
that
there "_rc insufficient
data at hand
on the differences
in their
behavior
and practically
none on the nonferrous.
Here is a fieht for

There
appears
to be some relation
between
oil consumption
and
cylinder
arrangement,
but not so with reference
to piston versus cylinder materials.
For example,
radial cylinders
seem to require
much
more oil than vertical
cylinders,
but there is no conclusive
evidence
that
air-cooled
cylinders
require
more
than
those
that
are water
cooled.
Again, comparing
the three Daimler
engines
as to oil versus
materials,
it appears
that there is no appreciable
difference
between
cast iron and steel cyhnders,
cast iron and steel pistons,
though
such
a serious
conclusion
should
not finally
rest upon
a single instance
like this.
An effort
to retain
the low metal
weight
characteristics
of steel
and to meet lubrication
requirements,
that
is worthy
of note, ifflvolves the use of hners for cytinders
and of sleeves, or even a separate
barrel for pistons,
made of a material
such as cast iron or bronze having a good lubricating
surface.
This is not only objectionable
as
complicating
the thelanal
and total stresses,
increasing
thermal
resistance
of cylinders,
and adding
something
to weight
removed
but
it now seems to be unnecessary.
At present
the standard
material
for fixed cylinders
is unquestionably cast iron with heads in one piece,
and _vith cast-iron
pistons.
There is, however,
a growing
tendency
to use tube steel for cylinders.
This steel cylinder
involves
a head complication
in shop practice,
solution
of which is now in course of development.
Heads
must have
irre_tlar
fornls due to ports and valve stem guides,
which are most
easily and satisfactorily
cast.
Such a cast head requires
a joint to
connect
it to a dra_m-steel
cylinder.
As alternatives
the following
are used, cast-steel
cvlinders
with heads
in one piece and cylinder
and head machined
from a forged billet or iinally the complete
sheet
metal welded ])aimler
construction.
Steel is the ador)ted
standard
materi,d
for connectinc,
rods and
crank
shafts
and always
is a very high tension
alloy suc_l as nickel
or chrome
nickel,
which permits
these i)arts to be very small and

light while amply
strong
and stiff.
Crank case or frame
material
is
still unsettled,
ranging
from the forged
steel cage of the rotating
cyhnder
engine
through
cast steel,
cast iron,
anO aluminum,
wit_
the last prevailing
in nxed cylinder
engines.
No successful
attempt
is yct on record,
to use welded
or riveted
sheets
and standard
structural steel shapes in the long frames
and crank
cases of fixed cylinder multicrank
engines,
where frame weight per cylinder
is a matter
of considerable
importance.
It would
seem
as if stiffness
or its
equivalent
uniforml'ty
of distortion
can better
be served
with less
weight
by such structural
steel construction
than by the soft aluminum casting.
To give a general
survey
of the practice
in materials,
Table IX is added.

weightsper cubic-footdisplacement fundamentally
are

andwall thickness.
Cylinder
metal
volumes
are least
in any cylinder,
other
thin_
being equal,
when the valves
are placed
in tile head instead
of m
side po(.ket_, so in the interest
of cylinder
lightness
this arrangement
must
he adopted
mdess
it appears
that
the compensating
factors,
which will be refen'ed
to later, overbalance
the extra pocket, metal:
but this is not the case.
There are, however,
several
successf_fl
acre
engines
that
follow
the standard
automobile
practice
of locating
val_ es in side pockets
mostly
of the [_-head form.
One arrangement
has the valves
side by side, both stems
pointing
toward
the crank
case, both seating
do_m in a wide pocket.
The other
locates
the
two valves
axially- in hne, one stem pointing
up, while
the other
points
down,
ann seating
on opposite
sides of a narrow
pocket.
The compensating
weight
elements
referred
to in connection
with
the head valve as compared
with the side-pocket
valve arranffement
are those of _alve gear.
Two side by side valves in one wide-pocket
are ordinarily
driven
b 3 a pair of push rods.
Placing
one valve
above the other in a narrow
pocket
reduces
the width and hence the
metal
of the pocket,
but adds a rocker
arm with bracket
and pin
and some additional
rod length.
Placing
both valves
in the head
removes
the pocket
metal
entirely,
but adds a second
rocker
and
push-rod
extension
ordinarily.
It is the weight
of these two rockers
and push-rods
extension
that is to be balanced
against
the metal of
the pocket.
Such side pockets
with ports, being irregular
in shape
and necessarily
jacketed,
can be formed,
as in the case with cylinder
heads
that
carry
valves,
only by casting
(except
when welded
of
sheet
metal
as in the Daimler
experiment).
The added
cast iron
due to pocket.s
in combustion
chamber
and jacket
wall will weigh
more than the steel rocker
arm and the push-rod
extension.
The
w.ei_ght difference
in favor
of the head-valve
arrangement
is greater
stiuwhen
a single rod alternately
works in tension
and compression
on one rocker
actuating
both vlaves,
as in the Austro
Daimler,
but
in this case two different
cams should
be used, one to lift and the
other
to depress.
Further
reduction
is possible
in standard
four
and six cylinder
engines
by placing
the cam shaft
directly
on the
heads
as in the German
Daimler,
for here the combined
weight
of
all push rods is removed
and the weight
of a pair of gears
and a
vertical
shaft
introduced
instead.
This is no advantage,
however,
in V engines,
because
with the push-rod
drive one cam shaft
can
serve both rods, and this is one of the advantages
of V arrangement.
Removal
of one push rod and cam entirely
becomes
possibl_e when
the inlet valve is made automatic
as it is in several
engines, but the
loss of volumetric
efficiency
resultingcuts
more from the po,_ er than
removal
of push rod even with rocker
does from the weight.
For
this reason
automatic
valves
are not to be recommended,
though
there is another
reason also strong
enough alone, that of unrestrained
seat impact.
Water-jacket
metal in all cast cylinders
will normally
weigh more
than the metal
of the cylinder
proper

one case and in the very high internal
pressures
in the other.
The
area of the jacket
metal
is considerably
greater
than
that
of the
cylinder,
especially
when the water space l_s larze, and the foundry
can not make a sound jacket
casting
as thin as'_ack
of stress would
warrant.
Accordingly,
while
the cast iacket
is retained
in many
aero engines in accordance
with automot)ile
practice,
this can hardly
be accepted
as the best aero engine
practice,
which
seeks weight
reduction
by legitimate
removal.
Sheet
metal
of cop_)er,
brass,
aluminum,
or steel in sheets, in drax_m tubes, spun and ale pressed
shapes
is so peculiarly
adapted
to the purpose
that its lack of immediate
general
adoption
requires
explanation.
This is to be found
first
in the _ joint
difficulty
originally
encountered
in automobile
practice,
where such a mechanical"
discouragement
was sufficient
to
cause rejection
in view of the slight importance
of the weight relation
to automobiles,
especially
as the cast jacket
is cheaper.
With aero
engines
the case is different
because
the need of saving every ounce
is vastly greater,
and the cast jacket is a larger fraction
of the total
weight
when
all the other
economics
have been practiced,
so the
per cent gain by sheet metal subst!tution
is great enough
to warrant
efforts
to find suitable
joints.
Ihis
has been accomplished
in a
variety" of ways, one of them being especially
noteworthy,
viz, electrolytm
deposition
of the whole jacket metal or electrolytic
deposition
of the joint.
Added
to this is the now generally
available
method
of the oxygen
flame weld, beside
the usual
screw-cover
and pressfit joint which
has always
been available.
Experience
with these
sheet-metal
jackets
has indicated
the necessityfor expansion
provisions
to avoid
overstressing
of the joint
when
the cylinder
expands,
exactly
as in big gas engines.
This conclusion
is itself
a
measure
of the distortional
stresses
set up in one-piece
castings
and
an additional
reason
for their abandonment.
To these advantages
of weight
reduction
and relief of cylinder
metal
from jacket
stress,
the sheet
metal
jacket
gives additional
assurance
of safety
when
jacket
water
freezes,
and especially
with cast
heads
or cylinders
permits
complete
assurance
of the external
soundness
of the cast
metal that is to resist explosion
pressures
and of the reality
of water
spaces,
which when cored may be filled with metal hi corners where
the designer
intended
water
to be, so adding
to expansion
stresses
and jareignition
tendencies
that result
from the consequential
overheating.
At least
three openings
to the combustion
chamber
through
the
jacket space are necessary
for insertion
of iIflct valves, exhaust
valve,
and ign[ter.
The outer ends of these passages
must be joined.atthe
jacket
wall by the jacket
itself
and the use of sheet-metat
jackets
calls for joints
at these points.
These offer no difficulty
if welded
autogenously
or accomplished
by electrolytic
deposition,
though
considerable
pressure
joints
are apt to be troublesome.
Expansion
is provided
in three
separate
wa_s,
(a) the slip joint,
packed
by a
robber
ring as in Green
(Britist_),
(b) corrugated
bellows,
(c) the
elongation
of a thin jacket
of suitable
metal
provided
the joint is
welded as in the Benz (German)
which seems quite satisfactory.
Jacket

are usually
ma(le m_rrower
on acre engines

heads
greater
width
is usually
necessary
to avoid
the formation
of
pockets
where
air or steam
may collect
next
to the irregular
port
walls, and the outlet for water
must be at the highest
point
to promote
expulsion
of ally bubbles.
Jacket
lengths
on the cylinder
ba_el
are usually
short,
normally
extending
httle if any below the
lowest position
of the piston
head.
This is not as satisfactory
as a
longer jacket
even if the space be narrow,
especially
as the cylinder
walls are so thin as to have a minimum
of heat-conducting
capacity
lon_itudinall_
y.. Tile p.iston, barrel .will give heat to. every part of the
cylinder
wall with which it comes m contact
and if at some low part
there is no water,
then the heat must be dissipated
to the air directly
or conducted
up to where the jacket starts.
Provisions
for valve insertion
and removal,
to facilitate
inspection
and regrinding,
are used in the very best large
internal-combustion
engine practice
but would add weight
to the acre engine if adopted.
Inlet valves are carried in cages, which, with their fasteningana
the
necessary
additional
guide walls, add several
times the weight
of the
valve.
Through
the opening
of the remo_ ed inlet cage the exhaust
valve, which
must
seat on water-cooled
metal,
becomes
accessible.
This accessibility
of valves
is the primary
recommendation
for the
side pocket,
which permits
of the use of the above construction
when
both stems are opposed
in line as in the Mulag.
In the parallel
construct.ion
it is accomphshed
by two covers,
one over each valve,
as in Sturtevant.
It is also attained
in the head valve arrangement
without
cages by the separate
or removable
head
which
in sere
engines
is objectionable
for many
reasons.
This problem
has been
boldly met b_ the designers
of many of the best sere engines by simply
providing
a joint between
cylinder
and frame
that
is easy to loosen
and by using
valve
gear
and pipe
connections
that
are quickly
detachable,
so the entire cylinder,
which even in the largest sizes is not
heavy,
can be bodily
removed
by hand
with ease and the valves
reached
through
the bore.
In this way the number
of parts
is kept
to a nfinimum
and a material
contribution
to low cylinder
weight
is
secured.
Low valve weight
would
demand
the thinnest
disk and stem and
the shortest
possible
stem, but process
considerations
are in opposition to this conclusion,
especially
in exhaust
valves where heat dissipation
is opposed
thereby.
Practice
oscillates
between
these
two
extremes,
but the heavy
construction
of exhaust
valves
must
be
favored
while the light is permissible
on self-cooling
inlets, unless it be
regarded,
as in marine
and automobile
practice,
unwise
to use two
different
valves in the interest
of reduction
of spares.
It is otherwise
perfectly
feasible
to make inlet valve
disks
thin with short stems of
small diameter,
and exhaust
valves
thick with large diameter
stems,
perhaps
taper
bored from the end toward
the disk, and lon_ enough
m the guides to dispose
of the heat.
If a metal of high con(mctivity
could
be found
otherwise
suitable,
then
exhaust-valve
thickness
might
be reduced.
Keeping
the weights
now used for both valves,
the excess desired in exhaust
valves can be secured
by reducing
the
inlets,
though
many
good engines
are amply
well cared for in this
respect.
Valve
material
is invariably
steel,
forged
to meet
the
requirements
of inertia
and impact
shock
at high speeds
and of
corrosion,
especially
in exhaust
valves,
and alloy steels seem better
adapted
than
cartoon
steels
for this purpose.

Here,
again,
the superiority
of the head
over the pocket
valve
arrangement,
and the imtifference
of air versus
water
cooling,
are
demonstrated,
but in addition
the steel cylimler
is shown to h(superior to the cast iron.
As to arrangement
of c_-linders wit l_r:_fe,:e}._ce
to cr'mk shaft, comparing
the four and six in hne, the 8 anu _2 cylinder V, there is nothing
conclusive
demonstrated,
though
for the h_tter
there are insufficient
figures available.
Radi'd star
_rr'm_enlcD_ts
'_re
consistently
lighter
than the above, not as much as mtght be expe,ted
for fixed c3,1inders, but quite markedly
so for the rotating,
which in
round
numbers
weigh only half as much
as the line arrangements.
It is the consistent
use of'steel
for cylinders
in the rotatin,_,
against
the cast iron in the fixed star arrangements
that is responsibl'e
for the
weight
differences
reported
rather
than rotation
vel_us ft.,fry.
,
Cylinder
weight
must have some relation
t.o the ratio of hen
to
stroke for equal displacements
and the variation
of stroke
per refit
of displacement
must
affect as well the shaft
and frame
weights.
The thickness
of the cylinder
walls should
vary directly
with
the
diameter
for explosion
pressure
stress
resistance,
"while displacement
varies directly
as the square
of the diameter,
and directly
as stroke.
The actual
ratios
of stroke
to bore will be between
one and two,
the former
_ving
a ver_- short,
and the latter
a very long stroke
engine a ccordinz
to precipice.
The short-stroke
cylimlcr
will reciuire
a thicker
wall t'[aan the long for stressresistance,
b}.lt_ the difference
is so small in view of shop limits
and the small
diameters
t na_ l_
can be neglected.
Even
allowing
extra
thickness,
the short-stroke
engine will be lighter
than the long as to cvlinder
weight
and d,oubly
so when the increased
thickness
of crank and larger crank case .lecessary are included.
More effect on weight
reduction
is possible
by
offsetting
cylinders
than by working
to extremes
of stroke bore ratio,
as this reduces
the height
of engine,
especially
when the colmecung
rod is shortened
as it may be at the same time to equalize
the side
thrust
friction
on the two sides of the cylinder
wall.
This offsettin_
is quite generally
practiced,
though
it is by no means universal,
anu
weight
reduction
possible by this means is small.
Cylinders
when
cast
are cast sometimes
singly,
sometimes
two z
three,
or even four together,
to make up multicy_nder
engines,
and
this is a factor
in weight
reduction.
Casting
a single cyhnder
complete with head and cast jacket is the old standard
practice
for small
stationar_r
engines,
and the method
first adopted
ior auto engines.
Such
cylinders
simplify
and cheapen
the construction
of multicylinder
engines
of different
numbers
of cylinders
to give different
horsepower
units, as the only change
required
to get a new capacity
engine is in frame,
cam shaft,
and-crank
shaft.
When
automobile
engines became
standardized
to the four cylinders
in line, four crank
form, it became evident
that weight would be saved and compactness
promoted
by casting
two cylinders
in one piece, the jacket
consisting
of two semacylindrical
and two tangent
fiat plate elements
for the
barrel,
and two semicircular
and one flat plate nearly
square,,
connecting
member
for the top instead
of two circles.
This produced
a stiff structure
which permitted
a reduction,
of frame or crank case
stiffness,
and it shortened
the frame
and shaft,
but required
the
elimination
of one main
bearing
between
the cylinders,
for which
with this arrangement
there is not sufficient
room.
As a partial
offset there is required
a somewhat
thicker

285

that

follows

the spreading

of main bearings
as supports.
This practice
of casting
two cylinders
enbloc
for four-cjlinder
engines
is equally
adapted
for six, and is
quite
commonly
adopted,
though
not
universally.
Acre-engine
practice
followed
in part
this auto
and marine
practice
for cast
cylinders
of making
two enbloc,
so that
the four-crank
engine
has
three and the six-crank
engine four main bearings.
Cylinder
removal is facilitated
by separate
cylinder castings,
because
there are less parts to be detached,
and the weight
to be lifted is the
least.
Separately
cast cylinders
are better
adapted
to sheet-metal
jackets,
so acre engines departed
from automobile
two enbloc practice
in casting
such cylinders
separately
and leaving
a bearing
between
each crank.
The four crank
engine
then
has five, the six crank,
seven bearings,
and the whole engine
is symmetrical.
This is perfectly
somld
and good practice,
for there
are no more important
members
than the crank shaf_ and the frame.
By this construction
the maximum
stiffness
and best distribution
of main-bearing
surface
is secured,
with least deflection
at crank
pins, and the extra
shaft
and frame
length
is worth
the small cost m weight,
for the weight
increase
is very small.
Steel cylinders
are always separate
and can
be substituted
for the cast cylinders
with sheet-metal
jackets
on this
type of frame
and shaft without
any alteration
whatever,
as may
also air-cooled
cylinders,
which by the very nature
of the problem
of
air cooling
can not be cast in pairs at all.
l_rame
form, for connecting
cylinders
and main
bearings,
has a
very large
influence
on the weight
]_er cylinder
in multicylinder
multicrank
engines,
because
the more direct the stress resistance,
the
less the metal required.
As evolved
from old stationary
and marine
steam
engine
practice,
the main
bearings
support
the shaft
from
below,
the caps being removable
upward,
which requires
a two-part
frame.
The low(r frame _member consists
of a cross web to carry
each main bearing,
and these are tied together
by a longitudinal
web
ust out of reach of the crank throw,
so for a multicrank
engine this
ower frame
member
becomes
essentially
a semicylindrical
box with
a semicircular
cross partition
for each main
bearing.
The upper
frame member
tics the cylinders
to this box by another
box, orby
the h form of double
column.
The latter
receives
a cylinder
at its
upper ring end, and its legs seat on the lower frame in the plane of
the crank
path.
Thus the stress
which
is alternately
tension
and
compression
in standard
steam
engines,
is communicated
from
cylinders
to main
bearings
in a decidedly
roundabout
way.
The
same is true of the second or box form of upper
frame member
as to
indirectness
of stress
transmission,
for here
the upward
cylinder
thrust is received
by a flat plate with holes in it, one for each cylinder,
and this horizontal
fiat plate
transmits
it down two inclined
semivertical
plates
to the edges of the cylindrical
box of the lower frame
member,
which carries the vertical
main-bearing
cross webs.
Single-acting
internal-combustion
engines
are subjected
to a frame
stress from explosion-gas
pressures;
that is, a pure tension
between
cylinders
and main bearings,
although
inertia, of reciprocating
parts
at high speeds on idle strokes
may introduce
a compression
eqm'valent
to the double-acting
steam engine.
Aero engines are necessarily
light
and their parts
also, so that
there is no real necessity
for bottom

nor for keeping

through
end holes in box frames or sidewise through
removable
columns.
Acre-engine
crank shafts can perfectly
well be
supported
below by bearing
caps, removal
of which permits
_the shaft
to drop free.
This greatly
simplifies
the frame

can be formed for compression
resistance
as a column,
and steel tension
rods inserted
to relieve
it entirely
for the tension
stress it can not resist.
The substitution
of steel shapes
welded
or
riveted
for the aluminum
casting
is perfectly
feasible
in such form
as to equally well serve as struts and ties.
Resistance
of longitullil_al
bending
of crank
shaft
due to the relative
forces at two diff'( rent
cylinders
or cranks,
is easily resisted
by side plates in the cast form,
or by diagonal
latticed
braces
in the structural
form.
This means
the elimination
of the old lower frame member
entirely
and tile substitution
for purposes
of inclosure
of a mere shell subjected
to no
stress whatever,
but formed
solely in the interest
of an unstressed
oil-tight
inclosure.
Acre-engine
frames
have not all developed
along these lines, practically
all being of cast aluminum
and only a few introducing
the
steel tension
rod, Green for example,
while a great many
retain
the
bottom
web, leaving
a hole where the more serviceable
upper direct
web should
be.
There
are no structural-steel
frames.
Reference
is made to the illustration
in the appendix
to frame
constructions
which should be judged
in this light.
Modifications
of frames
along
these lines will materially
improve
the stiffness
and life of main beartrigs, which should reduce lubrication
difficulties
as well, for the same
frame
and shaft weights
now used, or result in an equivalent
weight
reduction.
Main bearings
are almost
universally
of the plain type lined with
so-called
antifriction
or white
metal,
though
in a few cases
ball
bearings,
which seem ill adapted,
have been employed.

which is peculiar
to acre as compared
to auto engines,
because tile useful effect of all power develop(d

must
be suitably
supported
by the frame.
As
the loads are not severe, and the thrust
not irregular
as in main bearings, but reasonablv
steady
and always
in one direction,
this offers
no difficulty.
The _longitudinal
side plates connecting
the main bearing webs, to make the frame stiff as a beam, are equally
serviceable
in making
it serve as a column
loaded by propeller
thrust,
if the end

stiffened•
This end-plate
stiffening
is all the frame
modification
required
to receive
the thrust

reduction
on this basis becomes
legitimate
only when better
thermal
conductors
than cast iron, such as aluminum,
copper,
or the bronzes,
are substituted
for it.
Complete
substitution
is difficult,
in view of
their
expansion
coefficients
and
low stress
resistances,
but these
materials
can be used as supplementary
conductors
to stiff cast-iron
piston
frames.
As piston-weights
of any one design
increase
per
square
inch of piston,
the use of a large
number
of small pistons
results
in legitimate
piston
wei__ht reduction
over a smaller
nmnber
of larger
ones of equal area.
_fith
the exception
of the brass [_ section single top ring of the Gnome
engine,
aero-engine
piston
rings
differ not at all from the cast-iron
ring of auto engines.
Usually
the
thin lower end of aero-engine
pistons
is stiffened
by an internally
projectingweb,
which is an excellent
feature
and should
be retained,
however
heads
and upper
barrel
are increased.
Flatheads,
being
structurally
weak
and inflexible,
should
be definitel)
abandoned,
as is also the case with any cast ribs on the under
side of the head,
especially
as these
are useless
in tension
and involve
shrinkage
stresses
in the making.
Downward
curving
or concave
heads being
in tension,
nmst likewise
yield to the convex
upward
or domed pistons such as the Daimler,
which, without
ribs, is the best possible
form, but these would be much improved
by thickening
at the edges.
Wrist-pin
bosses,
while in a few cases separately
attached,
are norreally cast integral,
a practice
that leads to least metal for strength,
though
the deformation
tendency
on expansion
is unfavorable.
As a partial
compensation
for the increased
unit side thrust
due
to shortening
of pistons
and use of short connecting
rods, there is'a
marked
tendency
to offset the cylinders
an amount
recommended
by
Vorreiter
as one-eighth
the stroke.
This is of no assistance
whatever
when inertia
forces
are as high as they should
be, as on the suction
stroke
a side thrust
equal to that developed
by gas pressure
alone is
imposed
on the other side, so that
the symmemcal
cylinder
setting
in line
with crank
shaft
should
not be abandoned
for this reason.
The principal
value of offsetting
is reduction
of engine height.
Wrist
pins are properly
made
hollow
in some
cases
to reduce
weight,
while leaving
enough
metal
to resist
undue
stressing
and
securing
the maximum
bearing
area for the rod end.
They
should
alwaysbe
hollow.
The old bad practice
of tapering
pin enffs is often
retained,
though
in view of its natural
tendency
to work
the pin
toward
the big end, to loosen
and to score the cylinder,
which tendency is only opposed
by excessive
locking
requirements,
should
have
been
long ago abandoned.
Plain
cyhndrical-ended
pins,
of two
diameters
but slightly
different,
is the best practice,
and the next
best is a straightpin
or tube locked
in the bosses.
Bearings
in the
bosses
with pins fixed in rod ends have never proved
satisfactory
in
other
engines,
and there
is no difference
in aero engines
that
warrants
a different
conclusion.
Connecting

in having
the _Tistpin end solid forged,

The special
rod forms
are confined
to the rotating
c'yiinder
engines
with many

where

by some
arrangement
peculiar
to itself,
all involving,

the crank p!_, to which the other rods are movably
attached
to allow
the small relative
oscillation
of each with reference
to this bearing.
This system,
which for the want of a better name, may be called the
master-and-shoe
rod-end
construction,
even though
the name applies
to oifly one form, is adal)ted
to the double rod per crank construction
of the V engine as a substitute
for the separate
cmbracement
of the
crank
pin by each rod, either of similar rod ends side by side or one
straight
aud the other forked,
as the master
and shoe results in lower
me_m pressures
and less friction
than the double
direct.
Weight
of engine proper
per horsepower
is, as pointed
out, not to
be secured
by reducing
engine metal alone or by raising
speed alone,
but ma.y follow
a raising
of mean
effective
pressures
without
any
change
m metal
or speed.
It may also be secured
with the same
metal by maintaining
mean effective
pressures
with increasing
speed,
or even by lessening
mean effective
pressures
at increasing
speeds,
provided
the latter
increases
faster
than the former
decreases.
It is
therefore
important
to return
to the question
of mean
effective
pressure
and examine
it in the light of such arrangements
of engine
as may affect the weight
of cylinder
eomplete
per cubic foot of displacement
and the weight
of shaft
and frame
per cylinder.
Mean
effective
pressure
indicated
is entirely
a question
of port and valve
size and
of port,
valve,
and combustion
chamber,
c,
temperatures.
The former
affects
the weight
of charge
by pressure
drop and the
latter
by suction-temperature
rise, but
t]ae latter
also limits
the
compression,
which
is the other
factor
in mean
effective
pressure.
Mean effective
pressures
referred
to brake horsepower
are the same,
except
for mechanical
friction
and in the case of two-cycle
engines
for pump
work.
Any alternative
arrangements
or detail
form that
do not inherently
increase
the suction-pressure
drop or the suctiontemperature
rise or do not produce
hotter
internal
combustion-chamber walls may be made to yield equally
high mean effective
pressures
by the use of suitable
proportions
and dimensions
of passages
and
chambers.
Forms
or arrangements
of this sort that reduce
engine
weight
per cubic foot also directly
contribute
to the desired result of
reduction
of weight
per horsepower.
According
to this, u given number
of fixed water-cooled
cylinders
of
the same size should
.yield the same indicated
mean effective
pressures, no matter
how "they are arranged,
whether,
for example,
four
are radial or in line, six in the radial" groups
of three
each or all in
line,
eight
in line or in two fours V connected.
Any differences
actually
found must be charged
to proportions,
to carburation,
or to
ignition,
and can not be regarded
as iI]herently
characteristic
of the
OUping,
though,
of course,
mean
effective
pressures
referred
to
ake horsepower
will differ by the difference
in mechanical
friction,
which is least for the least pro[tuct
of bearing
surface and mean bearing pressure.
The same
is not true for fixed air-cooled
cylinders
because
their form and arrangement
does, to an appreciable
extent,
affect
their
temperatures,
though
the suction-pressure-drop
effects
can be made the same for all.
Therefore,
more differences
may be
justifiably
expected
among
fLxed air-cooled
than among
fixed watercooled cylinders.
The fixed air-cooled
cylinders
are likely
to run hotter
than
the
water-cooled
cylinders
so their mean pressures
would
be lower,
as
much so as the cooling is ineffective.

so differences
lU mean effective
pressure
may
be expected
in these
directions,
always
subject
to
proper
selection
of proportions
in other directions.
Speed limits shouhl
inherently
be the same for all fixed cylinder
engines,
no matter
how dispos_d,
so that
with proper
proportions
there
is no reason
why any arrangement
should
suffer
a greater
falling
off in m_au afflictive "pressure
with speed increase
than
any
other, however
much the constant
high value for one may differ from
that of another.
Rotating
cylinder
engines
are, however,
subject
to
lower speed limits
than
are fixed cylinder
machines,
on account
of
centrifugal
forces, though
there is no reason
why one kind of rotating
cylinder
engine shouhl not run as fast as another,
nor why all should
not suffer the same rate of decrease
in mean effective
pressures
with
speed increase,
as do fixed cylinder
engines
except
as windage
may
cause greater
losses, referred'to
brake horsepower.
Any one type of cylinder
and.piston
will run hotter
the larger its
diameter,
so a given piston area m a large number
of cylinders
should
result in higher mean effective
pressures
from the reduction
of suction
heating
andthe
increased
compression
made possible
by the cooler
interiors.
_iherefore
an eight-cylinder
V should be better
than four
or six cylinders
in line of equal
displacement,
and
the rotating
cylinder
engine of several rows and cranks should be better than equal
displacement
in one row and on_'_ crank.
Similarly
a large stroke
bore ratio,
favoring
smaller
piston
diameters for equal
aisplacements,
should
yield higher
mean
effective
pressures
than
a small ratio but this difference
]s necessarily
small,
as reduction
of cylinder
diameter
from 6 to 5½ inches_ for example,
can not greatly
affect interior
temperatures.
These principles
should
all be checked
by experimental
data and
can be so checked,
but such data
have never
yet been obtained,
largely,
because
such tests as have been made were directed
toward
a comparative
judging
of engines
in competition,
and were not conductea
for discovery
of principles
of construction.
Such results
as
are available
are compared
in Table 12 with reference
to the variables
discussed.
In the same table are incorporated
the figures for thermal
efficiency
which controls
the weight
of fuel to be canned.
This, while
slightl_
affected
by. valve resistances
as is mean effective
pressure,
is
depenaent
primarily
on compression
for indicated
efficiency,
and on
engine frictmn
and negative
work for brake
efficiency.
It therefore
is most
affected
by temperatures
of the charge
before compression
starts
and by interior
temperatures,
as these affect the maximum
compressmn.
As might
be expected
therefore
the differences
between
the thermal
efficiencies
are less than
those
between
mean
effective
pressures.

the fun(_uncntal

to rotating,
other things

and water cooling
to air cooling.
Reliability
of the engine as affected
by arrangement,
form, proportions,
and materials
is partly
tt process
question
and partly
one of
endurance
of structure.
So long as the mixture
is madereguiarlv

_ame,
which includes
lgmtmn
an_ cooling,
then the mean effective
pressure
and thermal
efficiencyshould
remain the same, and the en__ine continue
to run indefinitely.
This is the process
part of relia'l_ilitv.
It is
equally
necessary,
however,
that
no part shall break
or fi[stcnings
loosen,
and that bearings
shall neither
seize nor wear too fast or unevenly.
Breakage
means
immediate
involuntary
stoppage,
and
loosening
or bearing
trouble
a more or less fast apl_roach
to a stoppage, which,
if anticipated,
may be voluntary,
or if not, a stoppage
essentially
the same in immediate
effects as a breakage.
There is no excuse to-day
for any greater
number
of breakages
of
nero engine parts than of similar parts of other engines,
provided
the
same amount
of skill and foresight
in design
and construction
are
exercised.
The fact that the consequences
of breakage
are so much
more serious in the case of the nero engine than in any other is sufficient reason why the breakages
should be even less than on any other,
and should not exceed those that could be called pure accidents
beyond the utmost
skill and care.
It is, however,
undoubtedly
a fact
that stress analvsis,
skill, and material
data, for operating
co1_ditions.
..... to aero engine design than to other imare far less genera ll y apphed
portant
classes of machgilery.
This is partly
because the youth of the
art has kept the inventor
in the foregroundand
the computer
behind,
but largely through
lack of rigidity
of requirements
by purchasers
and
lack of financial
support
of the business.
If the business
of aero engine _produetion
were large and regular,
or Government
supported,
it
coula not only afford to pa) experienced
stress analysts,
metallurzists,
and material
investigators,
but would be forced to do so.
_
"
Breakage
preventmn
is therefore
almost
entirely
a question
of
money,
and of realization
that design is not purely inven6on.
It is,
however,
somewhat
a question
of arrangement
and form, for, as has
been mentioned,
from time to time some arrangements
or forms lend
themselves
better
to design
for assurance
against
breakage
than do
others, or some promote
a reduction
of seriousness
of the consequences
of breakage,
if itdoes
occur, through
pure accident.
An illustration
of
this latter point is the case of the rotating
cylinder arrangement
versus
the fixed.
Breakage
of a cylinder
fastening
means a t_rowing
off of
the mass under
the influence,
not merely
of the gas pressure_but
of
centrifugal
force as well, and with a good
possibility
of much more
serious consequences
for the former.
Even the breakage
of one of the
radial
valve tappet
rods will cause a loose end to fly out and whip

AERONAUTICS,

293

through
the supporting
structure.
Such is believed
to have been the
cause of wrecking
a Brutish machine
in flight and causing
the death of
the two passengers.
P_rtial
ruptures
such as cracks in pl'ston and cylinder• are. jpreventable,
bYcontm_etesPrO,

of. steel
for cyhnders
(hrectly
to
result,
as does arching
of
pistons,
ttie former
a contribution
of materials
and the latter
one
of form to structural
permanence.
Complete
ruptures
are probably
more common
in valve stems and other small _)arts than in the main
elements
of frame,
shaft,
cylinder,
piston,
ann rods, indicating
lack
of care or insuflicicnt
cxpermnce.
All such things are to be eliminated
by organization,
supplemented
by time and by long periods
of operation
of experimental
engines,
run under
specified
unfavorable
conditions
to complete
destruction
of any one part under investigation,
such as a valve and stem, or of
the whole structure.
Testing
to destruction
is the ,T_ry best way to
c
accelerate
experience
without
danger
to anyone.
As in the case of
the other illustration
cited, however,
form can contribute
something
to the reduction
of consequences
of breakage,
and in the case of the
stem of the head valve, this has been attempted
by piecing
the edge
of the valve seat slightly over one side of the cylinder
bore in an offseb,
or complete
enlargement
of diameter
at the clearance
and with the
valve circle tangent
to the bore.
Should
a stem break,
the valve will
drop to the cyhnder
shoulder
instead
of on top of the piston, which
smashes
it or itself, provided
the break is hi__h enough
upon the stem
so the stem does not emerge
from the guic_e.
Otherwise
the result
is quite
the same as if the shoulder
were
larger
diameter
of _ alve isp(ossible
than
the bore.
This valve trouble
is supposed

not present,
except
that
a
without
such extension
of
to be quite prevented
by

side-pocket
location
of _.alves, but is not, because
should
the valve
drop into the pocket
there
is every chance of it sliding owr on the
piston
umler
the influence
of a suction
stroke,
espeeia_y
if the flat
bridge
inclines
downhill,
as it usually
does in single
cam sh_ft
V
engines,
for example,
though
placing
the valve
on the
opposite
or
downhill
side wouldprevent
it, but would require
t_ o cam shafts.
Prevention
of undue
wear on shaft
and pin bearing
surfaces
is
entirely
a question
of bearing
pressures
and lubrication.
These
bearing
pressures
are all subject
to pretty
accurate
determination
by
computation,
so the design of an engine with excessively
high bearing pressures,
judged
by general
machinery
bearing
experience,
is a
pure technical
mistake,
not to be excused
by the addition
of elaborate
forced systems
of pump oil supply.
Bearings
should be large enough
to not need elaborate
special oils or oil-apphcation
systems,
but these
should
be added to make assurance
doubly
sure, in short;
as safety_
attachments,
not as essential
elements.
Weight
reduction
secured
by cutting
down main
and pin bearings
is too dearly
bought
to be
worth
the price.
Cylinder
and pistonbearing
wear, while mvolving
the same elements
as main bearings,
have to endure
the additional
difficulty
of high temperature,
but this is not serious if due attention
is paid to the principles
of heat
abstraction.
Violation
of these
principles,
coupled with a rise of side thrusts,
aggravated
by side cockm_, that follows undue
shortenmg
of pistons,
is another
case of pure
neglect.
Pistons
should be as long and as thick at the top as is consistent
with weight-speed
limits,
and wt_ere observance
of these
limits fails to reduce the pressures

The boxes

to really distribute

Piston
and cylinder
bearing
surfaces
are somewhat
more difficult,
as the outer part, the cylinder,
is normally
much cooler
than the inner part, the piston.
The temperature
difference
is greater
the thinner
the pistons,
and the difference
is much greater
than in the
case of the standard
box on the pin or shaft.
It is, therefore,
more
necessary
to care for these clearances.
This is done when the materials
are the same, cast iron on cast iron, by making
the initial
clearance
high, far higher
than
would
be feasl_ble on s_afts.
This
tends to promote
side t_mcks and leaks at part load.
For ecmallv

the steel cylinder
with cast-iron

gives about tt_e

but
not such good antifriction

and heat treatment will undoubtedlv

results, perhaps
even equal or superior
to cast iron, after proper research.
Tlns seems

This

the larger

In this respect
the rotating-cylinder
engines
are by
far the worst and the sinele line of cylinders
of the auto type of multicrank engine is best, near_y twice as good as the V engine for example.
Air-cooled
engines

offer more

for the radiator
of the latter

the

for war machines,

practice
to start

a practice
that

Such changes
also reduce tile

and produce

Any engl:ne with insufficiently

for propeller safety and for maintenance
of high average

may be
adapted
by addition
of sufficient

= The same fly-wheel

the crank-shaft

and adds to engine

Enaines
that can give sufficiently
uniform
torque
for the purpose
wit_'mut fly-wheels
must displace
others,
and while the four cylinders
in line engine
seems to serve,
it is true that
the effort falls to zero
on dead center.
An_zthing less than four cylinders
is out of the question. because
the gas-pressure
effort is enti_'ely absent
for a part or a

or {note:.
Increase

depart
less and
less from

and
minimizes
the angular

of the propeller

an_ other

I+rom this standpoint
the more
cylinders
the better,
though
from others discussed
this is not the case.
Arrangement
of a given
number
of cylinders
radially
about
one
crank produces
the same torque
curve as the same cylinders
in line,
provided
their cranks
in the latter
case are separated
by the same
angles
as their cylinder
axes in the former,
when,
however,
these
cyl_lders

the torque
will not be as uniform
as when these
are radially

about one crank.
It appears,
however,
that the
6 cylinder

arrangement,
in which
the torque
never
drops to zero, is quite
uniform
enough
for practical
work, and the 8

There

no reason

and, the sum of the vector
ang!es being 360 °, these vectors
will form
a closed equilatera!
force pol)gon,
which
means,
of course,
a zero
resultant.
Each set of such equally
spaced
cranks
is characterized
by a free couple, to balance
which a similar
and opposite
couple must
be introduced
by adding
a similar
set of cranks
with
equal
but
reversed
angular
spacing.
Applying
this reasoning
to fixed cylinder
engines,
it appears
that
the least number
of cranks
that can give couple and force balance
is
four, set at 0 °, 180 °, 180 °, and 0 °, and the next smallest
number,
six,
set at 0 °, 120 °, 240 °, 240 °, 120 °, and 0 °. Of course
any multiples
of these four and six crank arrangements
will also yield such balance.
This indicates
a condition
of in_eriority
of the fixed cylinders
star
engine
with many
cylinders
circumforentially
disposed
about
each
crank, compared
to the single-row
and double-row
V engines
of equal
number
of cylinders.
These star arrangements
must have as many
multicylinder
stars, each working
on its own crank, as the single and
double
rows of parallel
arrangement
has cylinders,
in order to secure
equally
good rotating
mass-balance.
This would
impose
on such
fixed star cylinder
engines
an excessive
number
of cylinders,
unless
crank
counterbalance
weights
were introduced,
with consequent
loss
of tile weight
adwmtage
ot!lerwise
due to the star arrangement.
Rotating
cylinder
star engines
are peculiar,
because
with fixed
cranks
all parts
of the engine are rotating--cylinders
and frames
in
purely
circhlar
paths,
pistons
and wrist-l_l_n ends of rods in a sort of
oval path,
while
crank-pin
ends of roos are fixed.
According
to
this the cylinder
and frame
are in force balance
when axis angles are
equal,
anal all being
in one plane there
is no unbalanced
moment.
The centrifugal
force due to the rotation
of the piston is a maximum
and radially
outward
when the piston is at outcenter,
and a minimum
at the incenter
position
with regular symmetrical
gradations
between.
Fhe net effect is a resultant
force constant
in amount
and direction
acting radially
outward
along the crank and exerting
a liftin_
action
if the crank
points
up, but not producing
any vibration
solong
as
the speed is constant.
Vrom the balance
standpoint,
therefore,
the
rotating
star is superior
to the fixed star arrangements,
but is no
bet_r
than the four and six cranks
and their multiples
with parallel
rows of cylinders.
, Reciprocating
masses
of fixed cylinder
engines,
such
as pistons,
_rist
pins, and an ap.propriate
part of the connectin__
rod, develop
inertia
forces for umform
rotary
motion
of the cran_
that
can be
expressed
by an equation
of the form of Fourier's
infinite
series, each
successive
term being proportional
to a trigonometric
function
of a
multiple
of the angle of rotation
from inner dead center
and to increasing
powers
of the ratio of crank
to connecting
rod length.
The
reciorocating
inertia
force of one set of reciprocating
parts
is therefore_ tlm sun] of an infinite
number
of forces of different
periods
or
frequency,
the first being largest
and its period
that
of an engine
speed, each successive
one being smaller
an(1 of longer period.
These
reciprocating
forces and the couples
due to them must
be balanced
perfectly
if possible;
and if not, as well as possible.
The forces due
to valve and valve-gear
reciprocation
with accelerations
determined
by cam form may be neglected,
though
of course
if these could be
balanced
in a simple way it would be desirable.

Balance
of main reciprocating
forces is possible
only by opposing
equM and opposite
masses of equal simultaneous
acceleration,
or by
arranging

There is, however,

into an axial and a right-anglo

RECOMMENDATIONS.

In the following
brief statement
of recommendations
and conclusions,
which are presented
in the form of a list, no effort is made
to develop
arguments
in support
of each because
it is believed
that
the text and appendices
of the report
themselves
serve as sufficient
support.
No specific
type
of en__ine, form
of mtrt,
material,
or
design
constant
is recommended,
lJecause
it is believed
that
attention a.t this time must be directed
mainly
to methods
of procedure
that
_ill
lead
to imI_rovement.
Naturally
specific
recommendations on design
could De made,
and these will De a_ ailable
at such
time in the future
as they may be desired.
1. The art has developed
several
typical
arrangements
of engine
and several
different
designs
of each type that may be regarded
as
of proven
acceptability
as to weight
per horsepower
of engine
and
thermal
efficiency,
but which
require
considerable
work to perfect
and standardize
l"n detail and material
without
any further
inventive
work than properly
constitutes
part of the normal
routine
of research
and designing
engineers.
These
types
are the 4 and 6 cylinders
in line, each with its own crank,
the 8 and 12 cylinder
V _:i_h two
cylinders
per crank,
all fixed cylinders
and operating
with both air
and water
cooling,
preferably
the latter,
for long flights,
and finally
the radial star rotating
air-cooled
cylinder
form for short
flights.
2. There have also been developeda
very large number
of special
designs
of engine,
which in some instances
have been built andused
but in others
remain
mere suggestions.
Each one of these is practically
an invention
in itself,
the precise
practical
value
of which
remains
more or less in doubt.
To properly
develop
the good points
of these and other
inventions
to come, and to reject
or eliminate
unfavorable
elements
that are always
present
in new machines
that
have not yet stood the test of time, much work must still be done,
quite independent
of the research
work so necessary

Private

produce
what is wanted
to meet aviation
specifications,
because
the
best shops x_ill not enter
the field without
some definite
assurance
of a fixed amount
of business,
for which they are, however,
quite
willin__ to compete.
5. '14he aviation
eneineers
should
standardize
service
specifications
for engines, limiting
t_ae specifications
strictly
to those items that bear
directly
on service,
so designers
and builders
may know
definitely
what conditions
must be fulfilled
without
being hampered
with purpostless
limitations
as to the means to be used by them.
6. The Government
should
conduct
regular
annual

of engines
on rules to be prepared
and widely
published
at
least 10 months
in advance,
and revised yearly
immediately
following
the closing of the previous
contest.
For those engines that make the
best records,
substantial
rewards
nmst
be provided
in the form of
cash prizes,
or buying
orders,
or both.
These cash prizes may be
rovided
by Government
appropriation,
by private
contribution,
or
oth together.
7. There
should bc established
a standardization
research
laboratory with a permanent
staff of engineers
selected
for efficiency.
This
staff should
conduct
the competition
tests, over not more than two
months
of the year, including
the reports,
and during
the rest of the
time should carry on tests for design and performance
data of every
engine of the accepted
class noted in No. 1, but of no others.
Other
engines
are to be admitted
only on the recommendation
of a second
laboratory
staff devoted
to development
of invention
noted in No. 8.
8. There
should
be established
a laboratory
for development
of
inventions
submitted
by anyone,
when those inventions
seem promisinu.
This staff must be quite independent
of that of the standardizatl_on research

in No. 7, and should preferably

9. In at least one of the Government
shoj)s, possibly
located in one
of the navy yards,

•
s u
established
the closest
possible
relation
between aero-engine
development
and that for other classes of internal
combustion
engines in which the military
now has or may in the future
have an interes_t.
Among
these are included
submarine
engines , ship
and launch
engines,
automobiles
and auto trucks,
gun andtrans_)ort
traction
engines,
and stationary
electric
generation
sets for wiremss,
mine
firing,
searchlights
or general
service.
The same
designing
staff, laboratories,
and shops
that should be established
for aero engines can also advantageously
undertake
similar work for these other
internal
combustion
engines,
as most of the fundamental
training,
knowledge,
data, methods,
and skill required
for the one is also of equal
service
to the others.
Similarly,
officers and enlisted
men of those
other branches
of the service
can be given adequate
instruction
by
temporary
assignments
to the shop, laboratories,
and engineering
office.
13. Publicity
of data should
be promoted
by governmenta_publication of reports
to keep alive the general
interest
in the needs of the
Military
Establishment
in the
internal
combustion
engine
field,
because
the greater
the interest
the greater
the contributions
of the
profession.
This publication
may also take the form of papers
prepared by engineers
of any of the various
staffs and presented
to the
national
engineering
societies.
Not only should
domestic
results
be
thus given
publicity,
but all foreign
pal?ers
and official reports
of
value
should
be translated
and
repubhshed.
Whenever
data
is
regarded
as being strictly
military
in value and where publication
is
therefore
deemeff inadvisable,
such material
can, of course,
be withheld, but it is believed
that in general
both Army
and Navy
have
more to gain than to lose by publicity
of engineeringdata
on engines.
14. It is regarded
as of the utmost
importance
that advantage
be
taken by the Government
of the service
of such civilian
engineers
as
havegiven
special attention
to the study, commercial
development,
and
use of internal
combustion
engines of a_ classes, and more particularly
those not engaged in manufacturing,
though not excluding
those of high
professional
standing
that may be so engaged.
The special knowledge, skill, and expermnce
that these men can bring immediatel_
to the
service of the Military
Establishment
should prove as invaluable
here
as it has abroad,
in Germany,
for example,
first in organizing
the
various working
staffs recommended
above, and later in working
with
them.
Advantages
may also be taken of the laboratories
of such of
the engineering
schools
as have specialists
of the above type on their
faculties,
or as may be located
in large centers
where such men not
associated
with engineering
schools may have their regular
offices.
15. No reeommendation
is made on the details of the organization
of these various
staffs and their coordination
with the existing
Army
and Navy
Departments
and bureaus
except
as to necessity.
