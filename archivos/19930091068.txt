Ihe determination of the probable Me of a balloon fabric in service by qxxirnental

. The results of a number of such tests are given in @urea 1 to 8. In these figures both the
permeability at 25° in liters of hydrogen per square meter per 24 hours and the percentage of
aoetone extract are plotted as ordinates on the same male. The solid lines indicate the permeability and the broken limw the aoetone extraot. The period of exposure is given in the
legend. Permeabilities of 50 and over, which maybe considered excessive, are indicated by
mrows; these mark the period of complete deterioration.
The temperature conditions prevailing during th~e task are shown in figure 9. The ordinates plotted are the averagm by weeks of the daily mean temperatures. A smooth mrve has
been drawn to give an approximate idea of the temperature gradient. The curve for the average
maximum temperature is roughly paralkl to the curve as given, but is about 10° higher in
summer and 5° higher in winter. This information has been furnished by the Weather Bureau
from measurements made at their stations at American University, Washin@n, D. C., and at
Pensacola, Fla.
A study of the data in these @@res leads us ta estimate that the rate of inoresse of acetone
extract of fabrica exposed at Pensacola during the winter months (December to March) is about
1.6 to 2 times as rapid as in the case of exposures made at Wash~ton during the same period.
The times required to show complete deterioration as evidenced by an excessive permeability
stand also in about the same ratio. The rate of deterioration in summer at Washington is about
three times as rapid as during the winter at the ssme plaoe, Exoept in the rate of deterioration
no very oharacteristio differtmeesbetween summer and winter exposure have been noted.
Aswould be expected, the rataof deterioration inoreaseswithincreaae of hunperature,but the
increase is not uniform. Passing from winter to summer, the rate of deterioration shows a sharp
inoresae in May and June. At thid period, which maybe regarded as cxitical, the megn tmnperature is about 70° F. The last 30 days of the Pensacola exposure showed the beginning of this
period of rapid increase.
A more significant factor to examine than temperature is the variation of solar radiation
for different periods, sinoe light is an important if riot the chiddetariorating agent in exposure
tests, However, the curve for solar radiation at Washington follows in a general way the temperature curve. The variationa in the intensity of the solar radiation are considmably greater
than is the oaae with the mean temperature, becauw cloudy weather haa a more”marked effect
to
in reducing the solar radiation. Attention may be CSIIWI the fact that the solar radiation
reached approximately its maximum as early as April and May. Unfortunatdy no radiation
measurenienta were made at Pensacola. There is not muoh additional information to be
gained from inspection of the radiation data.
The question of the strength of fabrics after exposure has been discussed by Walen in the
third annual rep@/ and further treatment here is unnecessary. The efl’eot of aging upon the
strength of fabrics has been followed throughout the exposure by means of bursting strength
determinations. This method ma used in preference tn tensile strength te.sta because the
results of the lattar are frequently misleading. So long, however, as the durability of the
cloth is greater than that of the rubber, the strength tests are of secondary importance.
& CHARACTERISTIC OHANGm IN PERMEAB-

AFTER EXPOSURE

Examination of the resulte of a large number of permeability teata after exposure reveals
certain facts which axe ehsxacttwistio of such teata. It wsa pointed out in the third annual
report (p. 461) that the aging of the fabric is usually accompanied by a decrease in permeability,
This decrease is eharactriuizedby a hardening or stiffening of the rubber, which causes the gas
retaining rubber film to crook when wrinkled. In order to deteot this condition, all exposed
samples are wrinkled before detwmbing their permeability,
It will be noted that in figures 5, 6, and 7 the permeability rises immediately after exposure,
usually reaching a maximum after about 30 days; the permeability then decreased se the

aging continued. The results of 95 exposure tests were examined h detemahm the percentage
of cases in -which this occurred. Of this number} the permeability @eaaed from th start in
43 cases; in the remaining 52 tests the pergmability increased immediately after wcp,osure.
The maximum increase was noted at 30 days in 37 of these tests, at 60 days in 10 tests, and 90
dap in 5 teek
In the cases where the permeability increased this increase was later followed
by the customary decrease and hardeni~g of the rubbar compound in the fabric.
Speculation as to the cause of this behavior has led to no de6nite conclusions. The explanation may lie in the fact that for some time after vulcanization the various components of the
rubber compound have not yet reached chemical and physical equiibriiun. It is a common
occurrence, for example, to have some of the sulphur crystallize out from solid ~lution and
“bloom” out on the surface of new fabrics. It maybe that some such change aa this temporarily increases the permeability, after which the oxidation processes which cause the decrease
in permeability ahow their effect. The increase in permeability may t~ke place in the majority
of cases, but the times of testing are not such as to detect it. The fabric shown in figure 4
always showed a. decrease in permeability after exposure. The permeability of the original
piece ran uniformly about 15.4 liters during the first few months after manufacture; a year
latez the permeability of the unaxposed fabric had risen to 19.2 litars. Similar increases on
storage are evident in figures 1 and 2. The fabrics were stored under ideaI conditions. A
great many idess as to these changes have been considered, but the data at hand are not suflicknt
to confirm them. It will require further investigation designed to settle specific points before
any definite conclusions can be reached. It is to be noted, however, that in the teats so far
made the behavior of the fabrics in this respect is apparently a property of the fabric, that is,
the same phenomenon has been noted in ill exposures of the same fabric.

4. OHARAOTEMSI’IC CHANGES IN ACETONE IEITIL4CZ! Fl!ER EXPOSUEE.
A

As previously pointed out by Tuttle,’ normal ageing of balloon fabrics is acmmpanied by a
slow and uniform rise in the acetone volubility of the rubbm compound, while serious deterioration is marked by a rapid increase in the acetone extract. This offers an excellent means of
tracing the deterioration of a fabric. Depending on the weight of the fabric and the composition of the rubber compounds, the acetone extract in the original sample will usually vary from
0.7 to 3 per cent. When the permeability has become excessive, the acetone extract has usually
risen above 15 per cent; no definite figures can be given, however, since the rate of increase is
the signMcant factor. During long and severe exposures the acetone extract reach= a maximum,
after which there may be a slight decrease due, presumably, to the production of acetrme insoluble products formed from those pretioudy soluble. (See figs. 4 and 6, for example.)
The acetone extiact is the best test available for determining the condition of the rubbw
in empannage fabrics, because the fabrics are not constructed to be gas tight and no permeability
tests are made on them. In certain tw~ply fabrics the acetnne extract has been found normal
even aftw the pmmeabiIity had become excessive. These were experimental fabrics containing an open-weave cloth which may have permitted a mechanical weakening of the gas
film without deterioration of the rubber. This emphasizes the importance of considering all
the tests in judging the condition of a fabric, since any one alone might be misleading.
The determinations of acetone extract were made under the direction of Mr. A. H. Smith, of
the Bureau of Standards, to whom acknowledgment is made for the data furnished.

5. EXAMINATION OF TEE FABRIC.
h addition to the tests made in the laboratory, a vary valuable indication of the relative
deterioration is secured from an examination of the cloth and rubber compounds themselves.
The exposed sample should be compared with the original and any change in its characteristic
properties noted. Such features as hardening of the rubber, tendering of the cloth, loss of

“tack,” etc., should be observed, The loss of “tack,” or the property of the freshly exposed
rubber surface adhering to itself, is a very significant point to be watched for. With some
experience a very good satiate of the condition of the fabric maybe formed.
6. SUMMAEY.

Exposure b the weather is the best means now available for determining the relative
value of balloon fabrics. The results of tests secured at difkrent periods of the year can be
correlated by a study of the weather conditions at those tinms. Deterioration on exposure is
accompanied by characteristic behavior as regards the permeability, acetone extract, and
strength, The appearance and feeling of the fabrio offers an exceedingly heIpful supplementary
means of determining the condition of the sample after exposure.

USE OF ULTRA-VIOLIYI’
LIGHTFOR TESTINGBALLOON FABRICS.
By JUNIUS DAVID EDWARDS

IRWIN L.

MOOEE.

INTRODUCTION.

It is quits necessary to be able to detarmine in advance of construction of a balloon the
probable reaietance of the fabrio to the deteriorating conditions of service. Extensive teete
made at the Bureau of Standards and other places have shown that reliable indications as to
the relative lasting qualitias of dMerent fabrim can be obtained by testing after exposure to
the weather.
Deterioration from exposure to the weather is due, among other things, to the cumbined
action of light, heat, and moisture. These conditions are extremely variable, and as a result
teeta made during different periods of the year are not strictly comparable. l?or that reason
it is highly desirable b secure a rep~oducible and, if possible, accelerated ageing teat. The effect
of exposure to heat has been invwtigated by Edwards,i Tuttle, and WaIen, and it was shown
that the relative deterioration of balloon fabrics produced by heating was not a reliable indication
of their durability in service. Exposure to light from an ultra-violet lamp has also bmn suggwtad and used for obtaining an accelerated ageing teat, on the assumption that the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight was one of the chief factom in the deterioration of balloon fabrica.
Rmenhain, Barr, and Booth’ exposed baIIoon fabrica to ultra-violet light from a mercuryvapor arc in a quartz bulb. ‘1%0 fabrics, both of which showed marked deterioration on exposure
to the weather for 50 days, were exposed to the u~tra-tiolet light for 64 days. The action of the
light produced no significant change in permeability in the case of one fabrio whereas there waa
marked detioration in the case of the other.
Victor Henri 8has studied the effect of ultra-violet light on rubber. Using a mercury-vapor
arc in a quartz tube placad 20 centimeters from the exposing floor, he ran tmta on samples of
thin sheets of rubber 0.5 millimeter thick. He found that unvidcanized rubber showed marked
deteriorationin 20 hours; the rubber became dark and shiny and cracked easily when stretched.
The vulcanized sheets took 48 to 72 hours before showing any marked deterioration. He concluded that the addition of compounding agenta generally increased the r~tancs of the rubber
to oxidation. Litharge was =pecially marked in this eilect. On the other hand, antimony
sulphide greatly facilitated oxidation. Applying his conclusions to balloon fabrim, he recommends that (1) in their construction there should be no unvulcanized rubber, (2) that the cloth
shall be dyed with lead chromate or aniline yellow so as to form a screen to ultra-violet light, (3)
that some yellow coloring mattw be used in the rubber itself.
BUREAU OF STANDARDS TESTS.

The tda made at the Bureau of Standards were primarily for the purpose of determining
the value of exposure to ultra-violet light for accelerated ageing teds on balloon fabriw. The
light source used was a mercury-vapor arc, taking approximately 600 watts, in a quartz tube.
This was mounted with a reflecting screen on a frame painted black and the whole placad in a

samples of fabric, 11 inches square, were tacked on a frama so shaped that the fabrice were on
a 120° arc of a cyIinder (radius= 11 inches) of which the lamp formed the axis. Radiation
measurements were made from time to time to determine the total radiation from the lamp
and the percentage of uhmviolet radiation. The radiation measurements were made by
W. W. Coblentz and M. B. Long, and a description of the performance and characteristics of
the lamps are given in Bureau of Standards Scientific Paper No. 33o.
Numerous tats of balloon fabrica exposed to the weather have shown that normal ageing
is usually accompanied by a slow increase in acetone extract and an initial decrease in perm~
abiity which is followed by a very large increase m permeability when the gas h
becomes
brittle and cracks. The deterioration of the fabric can thus be judged by a comparison of the
permeability and acetane extract determined before and after exposure. The permeability
was determined by the Bureau of Shmdards’ method as described in Technologic Paper No.
113. The permeability is qmessed in liters per square metar per 24 hours. The percentage
acetone extract was determined by the method described in the Third Annual Report of” the
Advisory Committee previously referred to. The reeults of a mriea of tits on balloon fabrics
after exposure to ultra-violet light are given in Table 1. The results of similar t+eta of the
same fabrics before and eftar axposme ta the weather for 30 and 60 days me given in Table 2.

For the proper interpretation of the data obtained in these tests it is necessary to consider
the character of the radiation to which the fabrica were exposed. The @ures given in the table
for total radiation from the mercury arc are for aIl wave lengths from Oto 1,2P. The total radiation for all wave lengths (from O to infinity), is, however, about five times as great. This is
due h the large amount of heat radiated from the hot quartz tube and electrode, The values
for the range Oto 1.2 p have been used for purposes of comparison because over 80 per cent of
than 1.2 K. The visible portion of the spectrum lies
the solar radiation is of wave lengths 10ss
approximately between the wave kngths 0,40p to 0.72P,
Measurements on the mercury arc show that the radiation changes in character and
~ intensity during the life of the lamp. At tit se high as 70 per cent of the total radiation was
of wave lengths shortar than 0.45 ~ (uRra-violet); this percentage decreased EIteaddywith use
until finalIy only about 50 per cent of the radiation was ultra-violet. The intensity docreascd
at the same time until it was only about one-third of the original value.
For purposes of comparison there is given in Table 3 the approximah composition and
intensity of the radiation from the mercury arc and the sun. The values for solar radiation
are for average summer conditions in Washington and the values for the lamp are an average
of the conditions under which the fabrica were exposed. The intenEit and digtribut.ionof
y
radiation from the two sources is shown by this table to be quite difkent.
The rate of radiation of ultra-violet light is about three times m great from the lamp as from the sun. Even
this radiatiomis not of the same charackw as that from the mercury arc as most of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun is of wave lengths between 0,4 p and 0.3 P, while the ultra-violet
radiation from the mercury arc extends below 0.2 p.

A consideration of the data in Tables 1 and 2 shows that exposure to the ultra-violet light
produces deterioration comparable, qualitatively at least, with that obtained by exposure to the
weather. It was found, however, that the action of the uMra-violet lamp was not nearly as
rapid as had been hoped for, despite its high rate of radiation of uhra-violet light. For exampIe,
fabric No. 22151 showed rapid deterioration ins ummer weather in 1sssthan two we&s, wheress
under the ultra-violet light there W- no marked deterioration in 43 hours. For this reason it
was necessary to extend the period of exposure in order to secure positive evidence of deterioration.
Further experiments showed that it required between 162 and 360 hours’ exposure to
seoure oomplete detariomtion of fabrim Nos. 22151 and 24580. Practicably the same result was
obtained after 30 days’ weather exposure in the case of No. 22151, while the deterioration
under the lamp in 360 hours was greater in the case of 24580 than in 60 days’ exposure to the
weather. Judging from service tests and weather exposure tests fabric No. 24580 is far superior
ta No. 22151 and yet the exposure to uItraXolet light shows only a slight difference in their
durability. Even when the amounts of uha-violet radiation were the same in both outdoor
and mercury arc exposures the de@eea of deterioration produced were very dithrent. In the
case of fabric No. 22151 the uMra-violet radiation from the sun during 30 days’ exposure to the
weather was 700 caIories; during 43 houm’ exposure under the lamp the ultra-violet radiation
was 670 calories. Yet this fabric showed no sigdcant
deterioration in 43 hours under the
lamp but was practically destroyed by 30 days’ outdoor exposure. Take another example:
Fabric No. 10650 during 158 hours’ exposure under the lamp did not show very great deterioration but was ruined by 60 days’ weather exposure. The ultra-violet radiation in the fit
case was 1,495 calories and in the second case 1,300 calories.
Teste were made to determine, if possible, the kdluence of moisture on the rate of deterioration. In the task marked “wet” the samples were tiprayed with watar twice daiIy. The
“wet tests” show a somewhat more rapid action than those made with the fabric dry. That
the difhrence between testi made under the two conditions is not greater maybe due to the
faot that the normal humidity of the air in the room is sufficient to maintain an appreciable
percentage of moisture in the “dry fabric.”
The effect of temperature upon the deterioration is a factor the influence of which is hard
to estimate. Fabrics exposed under the lamp were at a temperature of about 50° G. Fabric
No. 22151 when exposed in bright sunshine in midsummer frequently reached this temperature. The~average temperature of fabrics under outdoor exposure was much lower, however,
than those under the lamp.

CONCLUSIONfL

It seems evident from these few tests that the relative deterioration of diITerentfabrica
under ultra-violet light is not strictly comparable with the deterioration experienced in service
or in outdoor exposure. The radiation from the meroury arc lamp varies greatly in intansity
and character, and exposures made at different times are not strictly comparable. Moreover,
it is not practicable in most laboratories to measure the radiation from the lamps. The tests
are thus far from being reproducible and are not particularly accelerated compared with summer
exposure in Washington,
