INTRODUCTION.

The following r eport was prepared at the Lang10y Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory of
the Nation al Advi ory Committee for Aeronauti cs, as it e('med desirable that U1<'r(' should b('

information, among other r easons, in ord(')" to ha"\(' cldjnit(' lmow]('dg(' as to th(' cli. trihution of
load on thr \Vinas, and 0 to furnish the oa i for impro"\ed aecuracy in stref' analy i. An

Th o melhod usrd in lhe pro ont serio of te t was to tako mm-ing picturc ' of the vane and
air-s peed metor , whi ch were fastened about 1, inche apart, with a gun camera. A few
exposure from one of the record are hown in figure 2. Only one wing tip at a time could
bo workod on in thi way, a nd unsymmetrical maneuver had Lo be repeatcd in order to secure
complete record . The gun camera j Ycry un atisfactory for thi work, a it docs not run a
long on a ingle winding as would be desirable, and a it speed i not sufficiently con tant to
furnish a good time scale. The governor i of rather crude con truction, alLhough amply good
enough for gunnery practice, and the rate of taking pictures icon iderably afl'ected by accelerations of the air plane. Furthermore, many record were poiled by jamming of the mechani8m .
RE ULTS OF TEST

The fir t experiment were mad e in teady traight flight and with au·ect r ead ing in order to
see how serious was the error due to interference between the wing8 and the Yane. A .J~4II
airplane was u cd in these and in all ubseq ucn t tc t ', and is shown, as fitted up fo1' the te t ,
in figure 3. The vane readings were compared with the valu es of the angle of attack determined
for the same airplane in R epor t ~ o. 70 by the u e of ft liq uid inclinometer when flying level, and
it was found that inLerfer ence in cr eased tbe \'ane r eading by from 1° Lo 1~ ° at all air peed.
from 70 mih,s per hour Lo 90 mill,s per hour. At . peed . lower Lhan these the interfer('nee is
mor e mark ed, iller ea ing to 4° at :30 miles per hom. I t i not probahle that the error due to
interference goes on increasing rapidly a the angle of attack iIlCI"l'IISe, heyon I lh(' burble point,

mil e. per hour tho angle of atLack rose to 7°, a.lthough the angle for e([ui librium in . traight
flight a.t this sp('ed is only O.R o. Allowing for ftn interference enol' of 1.:3° in t1w nngl . when
spiraling, and taking lifL cocffi cien ts determined in free-fligh t te 'is of the IN 4Il , it a.ppear;;;
that the lift coe ffi cient ftC .5 . .5 0 is J . 4 Limes as large as LhaL at O. 0. ~eglecting the efrecL of
descent in spixaling, the theoreticGll angle of bank COITe poncling to thi load factor would be
57°. No apparatus for making accurate measurements of banking angle was available, but
it was evident from direct inspection that the angle of bank \ns approximately 60 ° (within
10° plu or minus). The experimental determination of the angle of attack, ther efore, checks
well wiLh the computed value in this simple ca e.

Direct observation of the angle of attack after the attainment of steady conditions howed
a great difference among spins. The angle of attack at the inner wing varied from 35° in the
slowest true spins to 75 ° in the most rapid maneuver . The angle on the outer wing varies
much less, ranging only from 7° to 10° in the te ts made.

FIG. 4.

In using the gun camera the r ecords were started early enough to catch the beginning of
the maneuver from the instant when the pilot pulled his stick back to stall the machine. The
variation of angle of attack on the inner wing tip during a spin and of speed during the recoveries are plotted in figure 4. Complete speed records could not be plotted becau e the speed
during the spin was below the lower end of the scale (4 miles per hour). Both of the e pins
were executed with the stick clear back and with the controls crossed (left rudder, right aileron ).
It will be noted that the spin starts with a large oscillation as the rudder i put overl and that

records on thi same airplane how a continuou 0 cillation of small amplitude thmughout

of long duration (too long to be followed throughout with the gun camera) the vanes reached
a perfectly steady reading, varying less than one degree therefrom.

The variation of angle on the out ide wing is plotted in figure 5. Here, too, there is an
oscillation, the angle of attack increasing as the machine tarts to fall into the spin and then
falling off as the rate of rotation approaches its steady value. The speed during steady spinning was about 60 miloA pOl' hour, the descent during the e spins being very slow while the
rotation was rapid.
A very approximate solution for tho velocities, taking Vn as 88 feet per second, VL as
66, an as ° and aL as 61 °, du.e allowance having been made for interference, gives:

The angle of attack at the plane of symmetry i 30.4°, whieh is of the same order of
magnitude a the angles of attack found during 'pins by British experimenters 3 u ing an entirely
different method.
It, is evident that, if spinning is a steady motion, there must be no unbalanced force'
or moment ', the air reactions on the air plane being completely expre ed by a ingle vector
passing through the center of gravity. The re ultant of all the components of force parallel
to any given line must then pas through the C. G. Tho particular linc which is of most
intel'est in this connection i the Z axis of the airplane, which ha been taken as perpendicular
to the plane of the wings. The coefficient of force normal to the chord of an aerofoil reaches
a maximum at the burble point, eh'ops off slightly thereafter to a minimum at about 25°, and
then increase ' again unti l an angle of attack of 90° is reached. The C
Ul've in figure 6 repre cnts the variation of normal force with angle of attack for the wing used on the JN4H,
although a par t of the curve was lifted from a wind tunnel tesp of a slightly different aerofoil,
the tests of tho J J wing itself having extended only to 20°. It is probable, however, that
all thin aerofoil ections of the same general form have closely 'imilar characteri tics at angles
beyond that of maximum lift.
To find the condition necessary in order that the re ultant of the normal components
may lie in the plane of symmetry it may be a umed that each aerofoil element form ed by
two planes parallel to the plane of symmetry acts independ ently of every other such element,
and that the forces and moments acting on the wing may be found by summing the elementary
forces and moment arising on each element. Thi method has been found to give good results

The rolling and the yawing in a pin act as a chrck on each other to orne extent. If the rolling

smaller and the backward angle of inclination become. larger at the tip and extends over a

A washout of angle toward the wing tips should he benriicial in spinning for two rea on :
In the [n' t place, equilihrium in respret of normal force. is se('ul'rel with a malleI' rolling velocity

the imler wing tip, inclined forward of the perpendicular to the plane of thC' chord neal' the

to give a negativC' yawing momC'nL ancl to 1'eRi ,t tho spin.
The yaw in a spin i primru·ily dynamic, not static, and it is clamping of yawing vC'loc ity ,

of minimum speed arc not very accurl1te). In other word, the aU'plane was stalled on its hack
and wa: dropping, gaining speed at the same time. The angle then increased to a second maximum of 20° as the machine hegan to Hatten out. It was very evident to the pilot and observer
that there was a negative loading on the wings at the top of the loop, and the machine seemed
to hang in the inverted position for a perceptible interval before the nose whipped downward.
The natural tendency i for a pilot who finds himself in this po ilion to attribute it to having
failed to pull the no e up quickly enough to get around the critical portion of the loop hefore
the momentum is c:xhausted, and hi next attempt he will try to pun the stick back more harp ly ,
r esu lting in the attainment of a till larger ang le of attack and a still quicker loss of speed and
more rapid dimunition of angle. It appear that the trouhle is due entirely to too ahrupt a
pull up , and that far h(> tter results would have been attained if the tick had heen ea.'led forward
as soon as the no e of the machine wa well tarted upward. There has heen no oppor tunity
