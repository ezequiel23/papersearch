THE LIMITING VELOCITY IN FALLING FROM A GREAT HEIGHT.
By EDWRJ BrD&k

WON.

1. The fundamental characteristic of the vertioal. motion under gravity in a resisting
medium ia the approach to a fial or limiting velocity U, whether the initial downward velocity
is km or greater thag U. “The equations of motion are easily set up and integrated when tie
density of the medium is constit ‘and the r~tance
vmies as the square of the velocity.
A fact not so much stressed k the slowness”of the approach to the limiting velocity U.
For example the simple relation v’= 2gh, which ~gkw@ ~together the resistance of @e a@nmphere, shows that the height “hof release from -t must be about 10,000 feet before the object
will attain a velocity of as much aS 800 ft./see. even withmt the opposition of the air reaistarye;__
and when allowanoe is made for that r~ist~ce the height must h greater. If, therefore,
terminal velooitiea of 900 or more feet per second, such ss me CUStomarywith airpltie bombs,
are under consideration, it k ody h-the C=e of f~ from a Wqat height (upward of 10,000
feet) that the terminal velocity can be ~y-@here nearly approached.
‘Here, however, another d.iftictity enters. The resistance of the air varies with the density
of the medium wd tti ~aria~on sho~d Dot be =~ed
a Priofi ~ be negligible iR the C= of .
fall from heights of upward of 2 mikk. In the standard table of densities at diflerent levek~
the ratio P/po of the density at ~titude h to that at the emth has become about 0.74 at lQ,000
feet, 0.62 at 16,000, and 0.44 at 25,000. The q~tion thus arises as to whether the changing
resistance of the air may be taken iUtOaccout i.usome satisfactorily simple way for the discmssion of vertiwd fall.
It is the purpose of this report to give that simple tieatient of the problem which I have

Now, ‘as the exponential of ‘F (multiplied by a oon&a@quwt3e
integrated, it is adviaable
to have a logarithmic expresion to. give the empirical relation between h and F, Try:
F(h) = b log , (1+(dt).
This holds for h= o and has two disposable ccmstants a and b. A least-squares solution could
be. made to determine the best values for a. and b; but a sufficiently good redt may be had
by passing tha curve through or near two sets of valu=. in the table:

Let ~ =8,000. Then F, =7.68. IA F, =21?, = 15.36. Then hl is just under 20,000 and
may --be taken as ~ = 19,000 by interpolation. Hence1+ 19,000 d =11 +8000 a)’=1 +16,000 a+64,0i30,000 d

and
a =3/64,000.

Whence &= 24;1.

Thus
F(h) =24.1 log, (1 +3h/64,000) =55.5 log,, (1 +372/04,000).

These check with the given values to less than 1 per cent, and therefore seem quits good

5. The formulaa thm obttied shotid not be applied to calculate velocities which are large
compared with that of sound. It is generally admitted that the simple square law of resistance
doea not hold for velocities much in excess of 800 ft./see. Just how well the law holds below
that figure may still be co~idered do~btf~; but two recent authorities 03. VaUier, Balistique
Exterieure, Encyclopedia des Sc.ienctis~fathematiques, tome IV, vol. 6, fast-. 1, p. 15, GauthisrViIlarS, Paris, 1913; and J- Prescott London, PM. ~ag., ser. 6, VOLXX, p. 332, Oct. 1917)

seen-at the start that irr~pective of air r~istance~ such a v~ocity ~otid not be obtained from
re9t in a fall of 10,000 feet. If lJ= 1,200, the velocity of 800 ft.lsec. w-illbe reached at the earth’s
surface only when the fall is thro~h some 15,000 feet. (Whether high v610citieamight not be
attained at intermediate levels is a quastion that shouId not be overlooked.)
6. It is often stated, as is indeed ob~us, that a body falling in a inedium of incretig
density such M the air may remh a ma~m~
velocity and be subwuentiy retarded before
striking the earth. The terminal velocity toward which the body strives is of course greater at
highw levels. The question of reactig a ma.fimu velocity is therefore a question of balance

For a given H this equation will determine th~ level h where the maximum velocity is attained.
If in particular this maximum should be at h =0, the altitude H of fall must be
. .
#:”o[(J@),+),-l_,]

For example, if U= 600, H= 12,500. The maximum velocity will be reached before shiking
the earth only if H> 12,500. If U= 1,200, the bracket has the vahm e-l= 1.73, and tbo.maximum value will not be attained unless the drop is from over 35,000 feet-levcds to which the
empirical formulas used do not remain valid.
In any case of resisted fall in which a masimum of velocity is attained the value of that
maximum velocity mti-be the value of the terminal velocity at that level, because the body
has been gaining velocity in the rarer. air above and will be losing velocity in the donscw air
below.
If, therefare, the velocity at L= O is below the terrninal velocity U, it may safely be
a!muned that the value for h = O has not been exceeded; but if the value for h-O is Iarger
than U, there has been a still larger velocity at some point of the path. The caution parenthetically suggested at the end of the last article can therefore ba obs~ved easily.
