The Rumpler Works found it Impossible to exeoute all

their orders themselves, and the Ru.C.I vms therefore built by
1ioenge, by order of the military authorlties, by many other
firms. There oan soaroely be another C airplane that has been
oonstruoted in anything 1ike such large numbers, not even the
D.F.W.C.V., whioh has oertainly been widely lmomn.
The Ru.C.I.

is

remarkable, above all, for its stability

and omsequent~y calm flight, and It may easily be oonoluded
that this was exaotly the type likely to be seleoted by the firm
in the further dwelopxents

of a transport airplane.

A more favorable Impression would be made if

mre not obliged to get in through the window,

but as It is, there is at least no need to maken the top spar
by breakl.nga door~y through it. The strength of the fuselage
is thus undiminished, nor Is it neoessary, for the same reason,
to set the fuselage spar partItiarly high and thereby to oause
a oertain Increase in air resistance and weight. Viewed with
. the eye of an.artist, homver,

the fuselage shows few flowing

outlines. This may be considered due to the too close follo~
ing of a type already existing; but the favorable flying qMIties of the type Ru.C.I. are a good reason for swh oaref’ul

As it is now, the upper wing surfaoe of the airplane is no longer in three parts, but in two, and it is supported on the in.
side by means of an A shaped braoket, ov~r mioh the aUiliary tank is Installed, on the suxface bet=en

the two wing spars.

Its shape is suoh ak to fit exactly into the out-cut profile
of the two halves of the lifting surfaoe, in order to avoid
oausing air reslstanoe. The semioirouhr radiator is placed in
front of the auxiliary tank, against the front spax and the
tightening turret.
Ash was the materIal used for the upper wing spars, pine
being used for those of the lover surface.~ The wing spars are
constructed like box supports, to W&ich the two halves, glued
together, are secured with pins and screws. The cross-seotion
of the spars branches off cutmaxds.
