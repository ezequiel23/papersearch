SOME NEW TESTS AT THE &5TTINGEN

L.ABORAT0RY.
I,

To the kindness of Professor Prandt]., Director of the Gottingen Laboratory, we owe the results of some recent tests,
namely:
1) FRICTION TESTS ON A SURFACE TREATED WITH ELAILLITE.
The results of these tests, and also those of Gebers and
Gibbons have been represented on Fig. 1 0 Pl.A.4, by laying of
the Logarithms of Vl/v in abscissas, and the logarithms of
the coefficients of resistances 0r in ordinates.
The product VI/v, or Reynolds number, is a dimnsionless
magnitude and therefore independent of the system of units
adopted. We may recall that the value of the kinematic coeffic-

ie nt of viscosity 'y is 	

M2/ sec. for air at 760 rni. and

24.5 m
a /sec. for air at 760 mm. and 100 0 , and 1330
10	
10
for air at 7.6 mm. and
For tater this cosfficient is	

106	

for 00 and	

106

for

1000.
The coefficient of resistance Cr = 	

R	

where R is

S. p
the total resistance, S the area of friction, p the density,

again is a dimensionless magnitude.
The relation betveen this coefficient and that employed
at the Eiffel Laboratory ( k f ) is as follows:
and V the speed; this

kf (kg/ni/in:sec. at 15 0 and 760 mm.) = Cr/13.
The results of the GBttinen tests may be represented very
exactly by the formula:

-2y._o. i

C r = 0.00376	

2) VERIFICATION TESTS ON TIM M.V.A. 358 WING.
The first tests on this surface were described in the
Zeitschrft fr Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt," of May
31st, 1919, in an article by Mr. Irumbach: "Tests for the establishment of Laws of Similitude with respect to Aerofoils.
It will be reiembe:ed that these tests xere made on curfaces of great depth placed between two vertical walls and that
they served for etimat1ng the probable results of tests of the
same wings of any aspect ratio Ahatever.
Concerning the results of the tests of one of these wings
(M.v.A.358) we have pointed out that we considered the resistance too low,.f or it was less than the friction resistance.
These testsere made while the war was still on, and the
experimenters had evidently not time to check their results
very carefully. They have therefore been taken up again recently and on Fig. 2, P1.A.4 we give the results of the new tests
on the M.V.A.358 wing. We see that the true resistance is appreciably greater and that it is no longer less than the friction resistance.
• We recall that:

A being the lift and W 0 the profile resistance, F, the surface, p the density, v the speed,

ic

and kxo the coeffic-

ients of the Eiffel Laboratory, and L. and D. the coefficients of the N.P.L..; E is the product of the speed and the depth
of the wing.
We ou1d rc1l that the superposition of a system of isospeeds and iso-altitud.es on the polar of the wing permits of the
immediate read.iiig of horizontal spied at any altitude whatever.
We see that, contrary to that might have been thought from
the first . teEts, the full scale results are not appreciably superior to the estimates based on model tests, provided that E
> 4200.
We must, iiwever. consider the results (ourve III) given by
wing 358 as superior to those Thirnd in a general way at the
Eiffel Laboratory and at the N.P.L.
3) C 0IvIPAR;'T IVE TESTS OF 7ITG NO 36 IT, ThT, EIFFEL

LABORATORY.
On Fig.

3, Pl.A.4, we have plotted the polars of wing 36

by the tests of the Eiffel Laboratory reduced to aspect ratio 5
by ?randtl'sforiflulas, and by the
on a

Gottingen Laboratory tests made

model of aspect ratio 5.
This comparison shows that the Gttingen tests give much

better results than those of the Auteuil Laboratory.

	

-4It is not possible to attribute these differences to a dif-

•	

ference of models due to the fact that the
made from a drawing of the model tested at

ttingen model

Auteuil. It

was

is per-

haps partly owing to th3 fact that the theoretical coefficient
ii figuring in Prandtl' s transformation formulas is not applicable to this wing, as is the case for certain experiments on apect ratio.
On this subject we may mention other experiments of different laboratories on the same wings. First, there are the tests
of the N.P.L. and of the Eiffel Laboratory on models of full
scale wings tested on the truck of the St.Cyr Aerotechnical Institute. We have also the experiments of the Laboratory of the
Central Aeronautical Institute of Rome on wings 33 (Ere'guet)
and 38 (Coanda) of the Eiffel Laboratory.* Lastly, we have our
own experiments at the Eiffe]. Laboratory on models of wings R.H.
F.14, 15, and 16 of the N.P.L.
THE EXAMINATION OF ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS LEADS TO THE BE-

LIEF THAT, AT LARGE INCIDENCES, TIE SPEEDS REGISTERED BY THE
SUCTION LAN012TER OF THE TESTING CHAER OF THE EIFFEL LABORATORY WIND TUNNEL ARE, OWING TO PRESSURE DROP, GREATER THAN THE
ACTUAL SPEEDS AND THAT, THEREFORE, THE VALUES OF k and

MEASURED AT THE EIFFEL LABORATORY AT LARGE INCIDENCES, ARE TOO
•	

LOW.

4) TESTS ON THE INFLUENCE OF LSPECT RATIO ON THE M0NDPLArI
7ING No.389.

The Gttir4gen Laboratory made these tests by employing wie
of aspect ratio 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The results were then
reduced to aspect ratio 5 by Prandtl's formulas, see Pl.B.34.
We see that they perfectly verify the e::actitude of these formulas.
5) REMARK BY PROFES S OR PRANDTL ON TI TESTS AT HIGH SPEED
MADE BY Mr. CALDELL AND Mr. FALES.
Speaking of these experiments thich be considers "extremely
important," Mr. Prandtl remarks that it is probable that for the
second critical speed the velocity of sound is exceeded on the
back of the wing and that, therefore, for determining the law
of similitude we must not bring in the product E V.t (speed
by depth of wing) as is done for viscous but non-compressible
fluids, but that we must take into account the speed alone, as
required by compressible fluids.
In other words, if we test similar wings of different
depths, the first critical regime will occur then the product
Vt is the same, while

the

second critical regime will be estab-

lished for the same speed, thatever be the depth of the wing.
In support of his opinion, Mr. Prandtl has had plotted on
Pl.A.5 the variation of k in function of the product V.t for
•	

the wing of camber 0.2 tested at McCook Field and for a wing of 
the same camber tested at G8ttingen and for which he has obtained
products V.t five times greater. He notes that the first crit-

\

E
of	 V.t,
ical regime takes place for practically sti1ar values
that, in accordance with his estimates, not having reached

but

the value of the second critical speed, the second critical regime vas not obtained.
In order to verify his ideas, Mr. Prandtl suggests testing
the same wing with an aspect ratio of 1 : 3, say; we should then
see whether the second regime ias established for the same product

V.t	

or for the same speed 	

V.

We may summarize Mr. Prandtl's considerations fro g a practical point of view by saying that it is nct possible to estimate
the results of full scale tests by tests of very small models
at very high speeds.
