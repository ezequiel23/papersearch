i n this passageway are t h e aileron and carburetor-

It is amply v e n t i l a t e d and

warned by t h e heat from the engines and f a c i l i t a t e s communication

is g r e a t l y deadened.

The f u e l tanks, holding s u f f i c i e n t f u e l f o r

The wings, fuselage, t a i l unit and engine supports are made
of duralmin.

The s t r e s s e s t o be withstood by these members are

d i s t r i b u t e d by t h e m e t a l covering, which is provided with riveted
strengthening strips.

The outer surface is thus made s o strong

that, i n t h e event of repair work on the airplane, important

structural members cannot be readily injured by l o c a l s t r e s s e s .
The main part of t h e wing is formed by a strong box g i r d e r _a
( ~ i g .3)

-

This g i r d e r is strengthened by t h r e e full-length spars

The thickness of t h e s h e e t

metal p a r t s o f th; boxgirders., as likewise t h a t of the angle
pieces and r i v e t s , varies between 0.6 mm. and 3 mm-, according t o
the d i f f e r e n t s t r e s s e s t o be withstood.

In order t h a t t h e cover-

&

( ~ i g .7) are riveted throughout t h e e n t i r e span.

Contrary t o present experience, there w a s at f i r s t some unc e r t a i n t y regarding 'the probable s t r e s s e s on the members of the

box g i r d e r employed f o r s t i f f e n i n g the wing.

In order, therefore,

t o assure the s t r u c t u r a l s a f e t y of the f i r s t airplane, two lift
cables were added under each wing, s o attached t h a t the bending
moments i n the wing girders are o f f s e t a s much as possible.
These cables give t h e wings an exceptionally large coefficient of
s a f e t y during f l i g h t .

They exert- a favorable influence even on

t h e ground a d i n landing.

In no case has any slackness of these

cables been observed.
The wings have a surface a r e a of 106 square meters, a span
of 31 meters, and an average thickness of only 0-Gmeter.

With

reference t o t h e mean chord, the monop1a;ne has an aspect rai;io of
