The fallowing report of a eompIet.e performance test of a 300-horsepower Hispano-Suiza
engine was suh~fited for pub~ca~ion to the A’ationd Advisory Committee for Aeronautics by
the Bureau of Standards.
The test described in the report was conducted in the altitude
chamber of the Bmwau of Standards under the joint supervision of the technical staff of the
Bureau of Standards and the E@neering
Division of the Air Service.
The program of tests
TVaSplanned in cooperation -with the Engineering Division of the Ah Sertice of the United
States Army so as to yield enough data to determine adequately the characteristics of the
engine for atiation purposes without operating it for so Iong a time as to prevent extem=i~e
flying tests from beirg carried out with the same en=tie later. -The particular engine used in
these tests was assembled by the En=tieering Division at McCook Field and subjected to the
standard dynamometer
test for operation at ground level, thert shipped to the Bureau of
St ancTards and mounted in the altitude chamber without overhauT. After the altitude test it
was returned to McCook Field for such flight tests as might be desired.
A prime requisite of the aviation engine is durability, but it is evident that the long runs
necessary to detertine
this are more properIy ma,de with less costly and elaborate equipment
than that of the altitude chamber.
The folIowing tests were made:
1- A fuIl power run at ground altitude at speeds from 1,4oO to 2,200 r. p. m.
?. An altitude-power run at full throttle and at speeds of 1,600 and 1,S00 r. p. m. from
the ground to 25,000 feet (7,620 meters) in steps of 5,000 feefi (1,520 meters).
3. PropeHer load runs, in which the dynamometer load was so adjusted as to produce
approximately
the same engine load as would be imposed by the propeller at
speeds from 1,400 r. p. m. to the normal prope~er speed of 1,S00 r. p. m. These
were taken at aItitudes of 5,000, 10,000, and 15,000 feet.
(1,520, 3)050, 4~570
meters.)
4. Friction horsepower runs at the ground and at 15,000 feet.

OBJECT

OF TEST.

The test wi.s made to determ&e the performance of a 300 horsepower Hispano-Suiza
engine and was typicaI of the class of tests usualIy run on a new type engine in that some completeness was sacrificed in order to restrict the actuaI running time of the engine to an amount
which would leaw the engine in good condi~ion for actual flight work.
DESCRIPTION

OF ENGINE

AND APPARATUS.

(A). Engine and supplies.
The engine used was a 300 horsepower Hispano~SuizaJ S. C. IYo. 13481. This is a J’ee type
It has a bore of 140 mm. (5.51 inches), stroke of 1.50
motor with eight water-cooled cylinders.
mm. (5.9 1 inches), ancl a compression ratio of 5.3. The Stromberg carburetor used is provided
-with a manually operated valve for controlling the air-fuel ratio at tbe different altituc~=.
MobiIe B oil was used for lubiicatio.n. and X gasoline for fuel. The X gasoline conforms to the
Aircraft Production Board’s Specification 3512 for Export Aviation Gasoline for the A. E. l?.,
1918. A distillation curve of the fuel is given on curve sheet 15.
(B). Appa~atus.
The engine -was tested in the AItitude Chamber of the Bureau of Standards.
This chamber
and apparatus is described in report No. 44 of th~ lTationaI Ad~isory Committee for AeroProvision
is mtide

for reducing the pressure of the air in the chamber to that of the altitude desired, while at the
same time its temperature may be reduced to correspond with the temperature that prevaik
at that aItitude.
Outside the chamber there is arnpIe equipment for measuring power, fueI
consumption,

and various temperatures

and pressures.

The mixture was then again

(2) A run was made with wide-open throttle at speeds of 1,600 r. p. m. and 1,800 r. p. m.
at altitudes of ground, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, and 25,000 feet (1,520, 3,050, 4,570, 6,040,
and 7,620 meters).
At each speed and altitude the spark and carburetor were adjusted as for
the ground run.
(3) A series of runs were made at altitudes of 5,000, 10,000, and 15,000 fee~ (1,520, 3,050,
and 4,57o meters) at speeds of 1,400, 1,500, 1,600, 1,700, and 1,800 r. p. m. In these runs the
dynamometer and throttIe were so adjusted as to put a load on the engine at each speed equal
to that which would be imposed by a propeller whose normal speed was 1,800 r. p. m. In runs
of this type it is assumed that the horsepower of a propeller varies as the cube of the speed,

The results shown in Table 9 are taken from the curves at e-i-enspeecls. The indicated horsepower is obtained b~ adding the brake horsepower to the friction horsepower. . The mechanical
efficiency is obtained by dividing the brake ho~epower
by the indicated horsepo~er.
In

RESULTS.

The more important results of the ground tests are shown on curve sheets 1 to 5, inclusi~-e.
Curve sheet 1 shows the maximum measured brake mean effective pressure to have been 124
pounds per square inch (8.7 kg. per sq. cm.) at a speed of about 1,600 r. p. m. The maximum
brake horsepower measured was 343 (348 metric horsepower) at 2)200 r. p. m., with the indication that this would have increased slightly at higher speed.
The atmospheric pressure was
such as would be equivalent to an altitude of about 500 feet (150 meters) and the slightly higher
results that would be expected under standard barometric pressure are given on curve sheet 2.
This shows a maximum brake mean effective pressure of 128 pounds per square inch (9 kg. per
sq. cm. ) and a maximum brake horsepower of 352 (357 metric horsepower).
Curw sheet 3
shows indicated horsepower, that is, the horsepower obtained by adding to the brake horsepower the friction horsepower at that speed, plotted against r. p. m. The lower cum-e shows
the dependence of power upon charge weight b y presenting at each speed the ratios of tJ~e
indicated
horsepower and pounds of air per hour at that speed to their ~alues at 2,200 r. p. m. The mechanical efficiency is shown to vary from 88 per cent to 83 per cent over the speed range tested, while the
brake thermal efficiency, based on the lower calorific value of the fuel, maintains a constant value of
26 per cent over the same range.
In studying the curve of pounds of air per pound of fuel on
sheet 4, it must be remembered that the carburetor was adjusted for each speed so that the

The curve sheets 6 to 8, incIusi~e, show the effect of change of altitude on engine performance.
Since it is the change in density caused by change in altitude that is the fundamental
cause of these changes, it is against air density tl.nit curves are plotted.
That the results may be
conveniently interpreted from a pressure standpoint vertical lines ha~e been drawn upon which
approximate barometric pressure are noted.
Prior to any careful analysis of the altitude cur-res the curves of pounds of fuel pm brake
horsepower hour on curve sheet 6 and pounds of air per pound of fuel on curye sheet 9 should be
examined.
The mixture wil~ be seen to have been very rich at altitudes of 20,000 and 25,000
ft. (6,040 and 7,620 meters) due to the fact that the carburetor adjustment was not sufficient
to permit the necessary decrease in fuel flow at those altitudes.
Extreme richness, of course,
manifests itself both in a reduction and fluctuation in speed and torque. Cur-w sheet 6 shows
