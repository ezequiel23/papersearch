SUMMARY.

This inve tigation was undertaken by F. H . .r orton, physici t at the research laboratory of
the National Advisor y Committee for Aeron au tics, L angley Field, Va., to upplement tLe
r ather meager data available on the construction and mechanical properties of small bearing
and pivots suitable for use in aeronauLical in truments . The tatic and running friction, for
thrust and r adial loads, was determin d for se eral conical pivots and for plain cylinch-ical
journal and ball bearincr. Also the tatic rocking friction wa measured for several conical
and ball bearing under a heavy load, especially to determine their suitability for u e in an
N. P. L. typ e wind tunnel balance. It i found that for a given small load the conical pivots
give less friction than any other type, and their wearing qualities, when hardened, are. excellent.
When the load xceeds about 1,000 gms., ball bearings give les friction than pivots, and, of
COUl e,
tand shocks and wear better. Very mall ball bearings are unsatisfactory becau e
the proportional accuracy of the balls and race i not as high as in the larger size. For
rocking pivots under heavy loads it wa found that a ball and ocket bearing was superior to
a pivot resting in a ocket. Vibration greatly reduces the tatic friction of a pivot.
RU NING CONICAL PIVOTS.

The pivots oil be t if mounted on the r evolving part, and on very mall pivot it i be t
to cut a small groove abovo the point for an oil stop, a on the balance staffs of watches. Tool
steel, such as used for making taps and reamers, is most uitable for pivots. The pivot aro

turned to size, hardened, and drawn very slightl y. The point of the pivot can now be polished on a r evolving lap, as hown in ficrur e 1. Fino emery is u od first, and then rouge, tLo
hal'dne s of the lap determining the radius of the point. A metal lap will give a mall radius
and a cloth lap a large one, but it is u ually nece al'y to examine the point under a micro cope
and get the radius correct by hand lapping. It is not possible to grind a saLi factory pi at
on a cylindl'ical grinder with an abr asive wheel, a the size of the grit, in even a fine wheel,
appl'o ache the diameter of the pivot at the point, and a ver y irregular surface i obtained,
even though it may look smooth to the unaided eye. As only the extreme point of the pivot
bears, thi portion mu t be polished carefully; the surface on the remainder of the pivot is
of little importance.

The sockets may be made by turning, turning and lapping, countersinking a small hole,
or by punching, the las t being by far the rna t satisfactory meLhod. It i neces ary to make a
punch of the correct angle and radiu of point in the arne manner as the pi-vat, and it hould
be hardened and polished with the arne care . It i.' convenient to hold thi punch in a guide
over the center of the hlank ocket, as hown in figure 2 . It i very important that the punch
he truck only one hlow, ,,-hich gi,e a socket a highly polished a the punch. If more than
one hlow is struck, the polish is 10 t. The ocket is now hardened to the sam degree a the
pivot. It is important that the radiu at thc bottom of the socket be equal to that on the
end of the pivot (fig. 3), for if it is larger Lhe piYot will slid around (fig. 4), and if it is maller
(fig . 5) the friction i consider ably increa cd. Before assembly both pivot and ocket must he
car efully cleaned to remo,e any chips or grit, and \\ hen together should he oiled with a ligh t
oil, uch as watch oil, more for protection than for luhrication .
The running fric.tion was cl termined hy mounting a flywheel on the pivot .to he te ted,
as shown in figure 6. The wheel ,,-a driven so that its speed was alway the same at the start
and then allo\\-ed to ome to re t by it o\\-n friction, the time being taken, thus giving t.he relative running friction. The weighL of the mo,inO' part was 160 gms . and their moment of
inertia 425 cm. 2 , 0 that the radiu of gyra tion was l.63 cm. In order to obtain some idea
of the actual ,alue of th running friction, one scI, of pivot was te ted ,nth the air friction
eliminated in the following manner: .A. hollow hra 's case wa {i.tted around the wheel and
helted, so that it could be driven at any peed. A small lit in the rim of the ca e allowed
the wheel to be started by the frietion of a smaIl rubher di k mounted on a motor. Thi slit
also allowed a black spot on the rim of the \\ heel to he ohserv 1. Th wheel was fU' t driven
by the motor to a given peed, and the ca e was r volyed in the ame direction and speed a
the wheel. It was po ihle to keep the b ox within a few revolutions a minute of the wheel at
high speed by the strobo copic effect of the lit in the hox and the pot on the wheel. At
very low speeds it \va m ore diffi ult to keep the speeds equal, hut the air friction is almost
n egligible at this time.
As the only friction i pivot friction and the moment of inertia and iniLial speed of the
wheel are known, the runninO' friction may he found.
sing the ame \\-heel and pivot without
the ca CJ we have the same initial kinetic cnergy and pivot fliction, hut also air fliction, \\'hich
van e. a the quare of the rotational speed.
If
T = average frictional moment of hc pivot,
and
A = average frictional m oment of the ail',
K. E. = ~ Iw2 = ~ Twi + ~Awt
When A = 0, i, the time to come to rest, is known for one case, and knowing 1, the moment
of inertia of the wheel and w, its initial velocity, T, can he solved for. Now, ubstiLuting this
value of T in the equation and calling t the Lime to come to rest in the open ail' with the same
pivot, we can olve for A, the value of which i independent of the nature of the bearings
used. A uming that the friction is proportional to the time required to come to rest, it is
p ossible by sub tituting in the equation, this time for an}' pivot, to obtain the approximate
running friction for that pivot. The result obtained in this way can only be an approximation,
a it involves the a sumption that the frictional moment varies with velocity in accordance
with the same law for all piVOL , and also that the air frictional moment varies in the same
manner. If it be a sluned, for example, tbat the running friction varies with speed less rapidly
than do e the air friction (as is generally the case) the eIrect of the air friction will be less than
that computed when the pivot friction is smaller than in thc case used as a basis for the
computations, and larger when the pivot friction excceds Lhat value.
The value of A was computed in one ca e !tnd found to be 0.203 gm. cm. C::ince this moment
acting alone would bring the wheel to r est in 13 minutes, and since the best pivot ran for over
20 minutes in free air it i e'(Tidcnt that, as predicted in the preceding paragraph, the computed
air friction is too high t be used in correcting the I' sults with exceptionally good pivots.
Tests were made with the shaft horizontal, and also with the shaft vertical, and the lower
pivot acting as a step bearing.

EFFICIENCY OF SMALL BEARINGS I N INSTRUMENTS USED IN AIRCRAFT.

The static friction was determined by placing a graduated beam on the pivot axle and
sliding a rider of lmown weight out from the center until th axle started to revolve. This
point was fo und on each side of the axle and the mean of the two r eadings taken as the moment
arm. I t was found that the static friction varied for difI'erent positions of the axle, presumably
because of minute irregularities in the pivots and so\.kets, so sever al readings were taken and
averaged. The static friction was also determined for the shaft alone. The apparatus for
doing this is shown in figure 7.
In the following table are given the propert ies of the coni cal pivots tested:

section of this tn)e of soch-et, which i u ed on some planimeter and imilal' in trument , is
shown in fio-ure 9.
As hown in the pr eceding table, two similar ets of rivots and soel et were tested, one
hardened and the other oft. The hard piYot an I soc: 'et howed no sign of wear, while the
soft one wore so badly they rattled around loosely in tbe sochets and gave more than twice
the friction or the bardened ones. Pivots were tried with and without oil and showed no
appreciable difference in either tatic or running friction.
The radius at the point of the pivot can be made as small a 0.0005 inch when it i de ired
to r edu ce the friction to a minimum, giving a starting torque of only 0.0005 gm. cm . per gm.
of weiaht. A pivot of this sharpne s can not be u cd for loads much greater than FO gms.,
and it is advi able for continuous running to make the radiu twice a large a this. If the
pivots and soc;, ets are hardened and highly poli hed they mal e excellent bearings for light
load and give less friction than any other typ .

A cunT of bearing diameter against running time i plotted in fiaur 10. The friction
e
decreased rapidly \\ith the diameter, until about 0.035 inch is reached, then the slore of the
curve becomes much Ie s do '.-n to a diameter of 0.020 inch. At this point the curye turn
down sharply, 0 that no decrease in friction is obtained by reducing the diameter further.
It is probable that the oil film breaks clom at thi point, as e,idenced by the rapid car below
thi diameter . For diameter~ in exce of this cri tical ,alue the CUITC i a1~l'roximately a rectangular hyperbola, indicating that the frictional moment i directly pro) lortional to the diameter, and, therefore, that the frictional force acting at tho periphery dopenc!s only on the magnitude of the total load and not on the inten ity of pre SUl'e. It i e"j( ent that a small bearing
should not carry ov~r 500 pounds per square inch of projected ar ea and 300 round ,\ ould be
safer. '.Gvo ize of sockeL \\~ere tried of SLOel but the ame result \' a obtained.
In figure 11 the static friction is plotted against bearing diameter for t,,-o loads. The
values arc rather irregular becau e of inequalHie ' in the bearing uriace , but it is e,ident that
the CUl'ves are nearly traight lines starting a t tho orio'in and al 0 that the ratio of the lope of
the two lines i the arne as the ratio of the t,>,o ,\ eights . I t may bo concluded that the ta tic
friction increases a the weight on tho boaring and a the bearing diameter, but i independent
of the bearing length. The static friction of any mall bearing (bra or steel, ll1bricated) i

The values of " mean running friction " gi\en in the table were computed with due allo,\-ance for air friction in the manner already d cribecl. It will be noted that the mean lubricated
running frietion wa only very li ttle less than the tatic friction, and ihe mean dry running

Tho fir t bearing was the most sati factory and ha about tho same. friction as a "irinch
di:1motor cylindrical bearing and, of cour e, will carry onormously OToator loads. It is evidont
that mall ball boarings can not be made at pro ent with onough accuracy to compete with pivots,
undor light loads (10 8 than 1,000 gm .). Howover, for continuou running, and where it is nOC08ary to pa s tho axle through the bearing, ball bearings can be usod to advantage. Tho static
and ··unning Liction is considerably incroa cd by oil, but as this inCl oa 0 is independent of the
load, oiling make little dilIerence on a heavily loaded bearing.
ROCKING PIVOTS.

The apparatu u cd to measure the tatic friction is shown in figure 13. It is simply a
pendulum with horizonLal arms to carry the ridors. 'rho. 'weights are so placod that the center
of gravity 01" the moving parL i ' at tho pivot point, and one of tho riders i pulled out until the
pendulum tarts to movc. TillS is done for each ridor in turn, and the mean reading i taken
as the moment arm. In order {o bc suro that the pivot is unstrainccl at the beginning of the test,
the end of ono of thc arm. i held and the pendulum rocked slightly in a plane at right angles
to tIle plane in which the Lest i carriod ouL. As it was rather cliIftcult t,o adjust the center of
gravit.~- exactly at, t,he pivot point, the moment arm for the sharper pivots could not be accurately
dC'tcrmineu, and tho value given may be in error as much as 50 pOl' cent. In the first te t the

Pivots that were loaded above tIll value howed wear and di tortion. It eem evident that
with a 1~0° sockot and 90° pivot that the greatest permi sible load will be given by:
L=3.000 d
d is the diameter in inches of the pi,'ot point
where
L = total load in pounds.
and
The fri tion of the e arne pivot when re ting on a flat plate, in Lead of on a . oeket, is
about halved, but of course would tand very littc tangential load. In all ca e when the loading "v-as hio-h tho point left an indentation on the plate. One pivot and ocket was inclined 15°
in order to introduce a tangential component similar to that found in wind tunnel balances.
Tho friction wa the same as when thc load line pa cd through thc pivot axis.

~\.s the same Bocket was u cd for aU sizes of pivot: the rounded pivot.s rested in the socket
as shown in figure 1.1, bearing on an annu lar area. If a socket h.a d been u ed in each case to

fit the pivot point the bearing would be as shown in figure 16, obtaining more area without
increa ing t,he diameter, thu carrying more load with the arne friction, but with some danger
of imperfect centering.
