.INTRODUCTION.
This report is the result of experiments conducted at the aerodynamical In.boratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
during the summer of 1917. The work is divided into two sections,
the first dealing with static, the second with dynamic, effects. The
outlines of the statical experimentation were determined after consultation with Lieut. Col. V. E . Clark, to whom the authors' best
thanks are due.
The work on statical conditions, in turn, falls under two heads.
In the first place, working from the lift, drag, and performance
curves of a standard military tractor biplane as a basis, the portion
which each element of the machine contributes to the lift and dra~
forc'es was determined by testing each element separateJy and in all
combinations of special interest. As a continuation of this work the
lcngLh of body, size of tail, and angular setting of the same were
varied, changing one at a time, thus determining the effect of any
such chan~es on the lift and drag. Incidentally it has b.een possible
to seGure data on the down wash from the wings and its effect on the
f01"('es contributed by the tail.
Secondly, by computing the moments about the center of gravity
of Lhe machine due to the air pressure on each element, a vector
dingrnm for the airplane can be built up from its component parts,
1 neI rules can be lllld down for the travel of the vectors and for the
ini{'iaJ balancing up of the machine without the necessity of a wind
tllllllel test in the very early stao-es of a desirn. Moments about the
cen tel" of gravity were also caIcu1ated for each of the changes in size,
~Ct,iillg, etc., of the tail surfaces, in order to secure definite data on
the efrect of such ehanges on the statical stability of the airplane.
The second main seetion deals with dynamical stability. The
rr.
.;;istnnce derivatives and damping moments were determined for
r, cll of the cases, and the length of period and time required to damp
io a certain degree were thus calculated, giving the effect of variations
in tho tnil surface on the safety and comfort of the airplane, so far as
the longitudinal motion is concerned. Some progress was also made
in findlog the propor tion of damping contributed by the various
parts of the machine.

The model was ma.de to a soale of one-half inch to a foot. The
wings were made of aluminum, thus combining lightncss with the
gT<:'lltest possible accuracy of working and freedom from warping.
They were machined roughly and then scraped by hand to the
desired section, the working tolerance being 0.003 inch. The tail
surfnces were made of brass, and were simply cut from a sheet
1\ inch thick, no attempt being made to reproduce exactly the
camber of the tail on the actual machine. The body was made of
pine, and the chassis was built up from brass wire, with solid wood
wheels. The win~ were maininin<:'d in their proper position with
respect to each otner by 12 roun struts 0.0 7 inch in diameter, and
made of steel wITe. In order to prevent the struts from working loose
in the aluminum wings steel bushings were pressed into the wing
planes, and these bushings were drilled and tapped to take the ends
of the wire struts. By threading these struts oppositely on their two
ends, an easy and delicate means of adjustment was provided for
the elimination of any decal age or warp in the wing cellule. No
bracing wires were usedl and the propeller was not in place during
the tests. It has been round that a model thus made gives results
comparable with those fo the full-sized machine, the
due to the
omission of wires nd propeller being counterbala.nced by the loss
caused by the use of round, instead of stream-line, struts. The wings
were made in the shop of ~ir. George F. Day, and under his supervision. Other parts of the model were constructed, and the assembly
was carried out, by:Mr. W. H. Phillips, nd by Messrs. Carl Selig and
Edward Tighe, model and instrument makers at the Institute of
Technology.
In order to make it possible to vary the length of the body, and
conscquently the moment arm of the tail, the body was sawn in two
just behind the rear cockpit, and the two portions were dowelled
together. Two· additional rear halves wero then made so that either
could be fitted on in place of the standard one, their lengths being
such as to make the distance from the center of gravity of the machine
to the leading edge of the tail 10 per cent ~reater and 10 per cent less,
resprctively, than in the standard mac11ine. 1\'10 additional tail
su rfacrs were also made up, geometrically similar to that normally
used, but one 10 per cent larger, the other 10 per cent smaller. The
three bodies are hereinafter refelTed to as long, medium (standard
J;{- 2), and short, and the three tails, which were tested in various
combinations with them, as large, medium ( tandard J~-2), and
small. Figures 2 and 3 show the model with medium body, and
figu re 4- illustrates the three bodies and tails.
The static tests were carried out in the customary fashion, the
forces being measured by weighin~ on the aerodynamic balance, to
pitching moments by the torslOnal strain which had to be set up in
a clllibrated wITe in order to balance them. The apparatus, and the
method of procedure, has been described in dctail elsewhere.1 All
static tests were made with a wind speed of 30 miles per hour which
has been found to give the best results in the 1Iassachusetts Institute
of Technology laboratory. The method of testing for damping, and
calcuIa.tinO' the dynamic stability, will be taken up in connection
with the iliscussion of the results obtained under those heads.

~he good LID is in 1 rge part chargeable to the raked winO's, the high

and that an angle of incidence of 0° con-esponds to a speed of 74
miles per hour, which is about the usual performance of this type of
machine. Points on the curve of drag against speed are secured by
'dividing the weight of the machine by the L/D at any given angle of
incidence, and laying off the resultant at the speed appropriate to
the angle of incidence in question. The minimum reSIstance is 230
pounds at 47 miles per hour, and indicates a best gliding angle of 1
in 7.8. The minimum horsepower required is 28, at 45 miles per
hour. With an engine developing slightly over 90 horsepower, such
as was used in this machine, and a propeller efficiency of 80 per cent,
a speed of 74 miles per hour should be secured. The angle of incidence at the maximum speed 'will then be 0°. Dr. J . O. Hunsaker
found 1 a maximum speed of 73 miles per hour for this machine, using
a different model, with wooden wings.

LIFT AND DRAG CONTRIBUTED BY BODY AND CHASSIS, TESTED WITHOUT WINGS.

•

This series of e:\:periments comprised tests of each of the three
bodies alone, of the medium tail alone, of the medium body with
chnssis attached, and of the medium body with chassis and medium
t'lil.
'
A comparison of the tests of the three bodies indicates nothing
except that such changes as were made in length of body affect
neither lift nor drag to an extent affecting n.erodynamic efficiency
in design. The curves drawn for tl e three cross and recross in a
highly lrregular fashion, the difference between them always lying
well within the limits of probable experimental error, which error is,
of ('ourse, a relatively large percentage of the force involved when
that force is very small.
In figure 8 is plotted the lift of the body and the lift due to chassis
alone when in combination with body (obtained by subtracting the
lift of the body alone from the lift of body and chassis together) .
In figure 9 are given the corresponding curves for resistance. The
points marked on the body curves are those obtained for the medium
body.
The lift due to the body is zero at + to (all angles referred to the
line of the top longerons as datum) . It is nearly directly proportional
to n.ngle at all angles from - 8° to + 30° (i. e., the lift curve is virtunlly a straight line) . It shows a tendency, however, to increase
ruther more rapidly at large angles than at small. It should never
be forgotten that these values for lift, as well as those for resistance
due to the body, will be materially modified by the addition of the
wing:->, the do",-uwash from which members will decrease the lift.
The quantitative values of this effect ,\ill be discussed later.
The lift due to the chnssis is always positive and is virtually
constant. Although no test was made on the chassis alone, the
natural assumption is that the apparent chassis lift is the result of
the formation of eddies and screening of the rear portion of the body,
and that there is no dynamic lift on the chassis itself. This efJect
is hardly worth considering on the full-scale machine, the lift from
this source being always less than 5 pounds.

change of angle in either direction. The resistance due to the
chassis, on the other hand, is lea<;t at a large negative a.ngle, where

raplcUy at large anglos than at small. The curve ~uts tho aXIS of
zero lift at an anO"le of 3°, and the slope of the curvels about 0.75 of
tho slope of tho lift curve for the tnil alone. This chauge in slope
may be attributed to three causes . The most obvious is that a consieler, ble part of the tail (about 7 per cont) is actually resting on top
of tho body, and is virtually 110nexistem, in so far as aerodynamical
effects aro concerned. r he secol d is tho decrease in speed of the air
which hus passed over tho body, and the third is that, as observed
hy Eiffel,t the angle of downw 1sh increases less rapidly than the
angle of incidence. (NOTE.-'rhis phenomenon is prob bly less
marked than Eiffel's experiments would indicate, as he hiled to
t'lke account of the second of the causes which we nave mentioned).
Tho causo for the downwash when the wings are not presont is not
apparent, as an upcuuent would seem more probable from the shape
of tbo body and position of tho tail.
The drag due to the tail, becauso of the downwush noted abovo,
has its minimum at un angle of 2°. It is not symmetrica.l about this
anglo, increasing much more rnpicUy at negative than at positiv'e
11 ngles. The m.lllimum draO" due to tho tail is very small, being
b:11·01y half the minimum vi'ilue for the tail alono and less than 20
per cent of the minimum for the body, but it incroases more rapidly
than any other component, so that at :wo it is materially larger thun
that for oither body or chassis. The dr g curve for the tail in combination with body and chassis is less regubr thau for tail alone, the
values increasing less rapidly at small, and much more rapidly at
largo, angles.
It should bo noted that great caution must be exercised in drawing
conclusions from tests of the tai-, since the elevator po"ition is neutral
throughout, as is the custom in practicdly nll wind tunnel tests, and
tho lift ancI drag ar e therefore considerably different from those
which would arise in actual :flight.

hO"'eve1', that these struts have no important euect on the lift,

values of the lift coefficient, to be used in computing thc landing
speed, are in ther:1tio 0.937, as against 0.955] obtained byJ)1'. HUllSakcl'
for both the R. A. F . 6 and Curtiss wings. The bttcr tests differed
from the present ones, in addition to the/oints already mentioneJ,
in that there was no stagger, the gap/chor ra.tio was 1.2 instead of 1,
and the aspect ratio was less. Tests made by Dr. Hunsaker at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by the staff of the
N tional Physical Laboratory,s indicate thn.t there is a loss of about
5 pcr cent consequent on "'he redu ction of the gap/chord ru.tio from
1.2 to 1, and a gam of about 2 per cent from the use of a 20 per cent
stagger. The exact result of changing aspect ratio in a biplane is
uncertain, but it is probable that a decl'ense in this ratio increases
the biplane lift factor sli~htly. Takin~ all these modifications into
account, the lift correctlOll obtained by us may be reganled as
coinciding very closely with Dr. Hunsaker's results, that from the
present experiments being; a trifle the higher, and we therefore draw
the conclusion that the biplane coefficients may be considered as
virtually independent of the plan form of the wings. The effect of
changes in section, and especially the gain from mn,king up the two
wings of different sections, remains to be further mvestigatccl.
There is, of course, some loss in lift, especially at l:1rge angles, due
to turbulence about the struts, although this should be slight enough
not to affect the validity of the conclusions which we have based on
the a sumption that the strut effect was nil. Any such effect would
be relatively more pronounced on the model than on the full-scale
n,jrplane with stren,m-line struts. Taking account of all such disturbing hctors] a correction coefficient of 0.95 may be used in finding
the maximum lift for a biplane combination with a gap/chord r<1tio
of approximn,tely 1, and a stagger of from 10 to 25 per cent. The
effect of chassis, body, and tail on the landing speed will be discussed
in the next section.
It was previously remarked that little can be deduced from a
cornpari on of the drift CUl'\'e for the biplane with that for the monoplane, since the effect of the struts can not be readily determined.

I

/

At very small angles tbe lift curves for the biplane combination
and for the machine without tail 1'e })ractically coincidont, showing
t,hat the lifting effect of the body and chassis is nil, or, in other words,
that tho downwash from tho wings, acting on the rear of the hody,
is roughly sufficient to balfince tho lift ansing from direct dynamic
pressure on the lower surface 01 the body. As the angle of incidenco
increases, however, the two curves divergo, the se.Rara.tion first
becoming noticeable at about _1°, and the lifting eilect thus indi.cated
increases in magnitude until, at 10°, the lift due to the body and
chassis is about 0.015 pound. This :fi~urc is, of course, in excess
of the lift which must be furnished hy tl10 body to repl ce that lost
because of the containing of the part of the lower wing (:1bout 5
per cent of its total area) within tho body. 'l'ho two curves cross at
ahout 15°, indicating that the body xerts an effect oppo ed to the
lift of tho wings from thore on, but the flow about the 'wings is so
unst,on.dy at these large a.ngles that the measurement of the forcos is
comparatively inaccurate, and it would be highly unsafe to generalize
on conclusions 'd rawn from such small ditferences between large
quantities as those with which we are dea.ling, and based on ono or
two points from a single tost..
The manner in which lift is affected by tho addition of a tail will
be discussed more extensi'\·cly at 11 somewhat 1l1ter point, in connection with other tests uncler varying conditions with respect to
tho tail. It is sufficient to note h ero that t.he tail has a considerul11e
effective negative lift at negil.tive angles, that this decreases steadily
until, at about 11 0, the efi'c('.t becomes zero, and that at larger a.ngles
it gives rise to au increasing positive lift.
The additional drag c:1used by tho addition of body and chassis
raml1ins I1lmost consta~t, incroasing very slowly, except at vory
largo anglos, where the mcrcase becomes more r!1pid. It has, at 0°,
a value of 0.015 pound, as against a minimum drag of 0.080 pound '01'
tho biplane combination,nd 0.105 pound for the complete machine.
At n angle of 12° this resistance ha.s increa.sed from 0.015 pound to
0.025. , It will be noted that the drclg caused on the com-olete ma.chine
by the addition of body and chassis is ma.terially less than tIll ~r

EFFECT OF ANGULAR SETTING OF THE TAIL ON LJ1i''T AND DRIFT AT
VARIOUS 'WING INCIDENCES.

For the tests reported in this l1nd the following section tho medium
body was used with the tltils inclincd to the wing chord successive y
as follows : Ln.rge tail, _ I", _ 2°, _ 3}0; medium tail, _ 2°, _ 3·}O,
_5 0; smaU tail, - 3tO, _5°, _7°. Different ranges of angles were
adopted so that, as far as could be estimated in advance, the static
longitudinal stability would not be excessive, nor would the instability be very great, in any test.
The result3 a.re O'iven by four sets of curves, figures 13 to 16, inc usive Each of thet'st three gives the L andD curves for the three settings of some one tail. Fi;rure 16 is a collection of the Land D curvC's
for the three tails at - 3}~ to the wings, and is designed particularly
to show the results of vnrying the size of tail. An averaging of
results for the three sets of gruphs shows, what would be expected,
that the lift increases ste::.dily as the negative angle of the tail with
r espect to the wings decreases. The amount of this increase, fo!' a.
given variation in tail setting:, docs not vary appreciably with angle
of incidence, except at very large l1.l1gles, and r nges from 0.010 to
0 .015 pound per dewee of tail angle, the larger values occurring
on the smaU tail. Tne variations in effect are so small, however, that
little significance should be attllched to the latter fact. At angle;:;
dose to and beyond the bm'ble point, the curves spread out somewhat,
the apparent effect of the change in setting becoming greater, and
this has the effect of causin,~ the burble point to occur at a larger
angle of incidence as the tail and wing chords become more nearly
parnllel. As a concrete example, we may consider the landing speed,
which was found to be 41 miles per hour for the standard machine.
With the tail set at - 1° insteaa of at - 3,z°, this value would be
decreased by i mile an hour- a gain hardly worth taking into consideration.
At small angles the change in total drag is almost too small to
determine, although a decrease in relative tail angle has a tendencv
to decrease the drag. At intermediate angles (the exact range dIffering for the till'ee tails) the three curves merge together. At some

EFFECT OF VARYING SIZE OF T!.IL, I"EE ING A.1\;"GLE OF SETTY. 'G
CO~S,!',

i'T,

The curves for the machine wi 1 the thl'ec tails alI'cndy described.
tho tail bing set n.t - 3~· ° to tho I';ing chorl in every case, are plotted
in figuro ) 6. These cun'es show th;t th" lift for tlle whole machine
throughout ranks inver ely as the izcs of the tails-tl at is, it is greatest for the small tail and least for the large tail. The sp.-wing betwcnn
the three cur,es is nearly constant, The :lrrn.ng mont of the CUlTes
in this order is what would be expected ;'l,t S H\ll angles, where tho
total force duo to the tnil is dOWl.linlrd and the negative e1ect is
naturally least for it tail of small area, bu t the renson for such behn,vior
at hrge ' nglcs is less obvious, While it ,vould be impos ible to ch'<1w
definite cOllclu ions without makillg an exhaustive investig< tion of
the pressure distribution over the surfn,ce of the tail, the most probable hypothesis to account for the phenomenon is that the do"'llwash from the wings is less f It 11c:1r the body than out in the open
and that tho farther away from the bouy one $ets the greater the
downwitsh angle becomes. The mean dO\\Ilwasn angle will then be
larger for the large tail than for the small, t nd the lift (ta.king account
of , ign) will n,lways be less for a hrge tail than for !1 small OD ".
The ch'ag, too, is largest for the smull tail at angles equal to and
greater than 2°. From _ 2° to +2° the CUl'ves merge together,
and at nega.tive angles greater than - 2° the drag for tlie small tail
is least. This, too, may be accounted for by the hypothesis st:1ted
bovc in conjunction with the bet that at the points of maximum
downwash (i . e., the parts farthest a;way from the body) there is
proha.bly an actual negative dra.g on the tail, due to eddying nd the
existence of pressure on the top of the tuil. This is analogous to
the force which when a pair of plates are exposed in tandem tends
to dr:1W the rel1rmost forward into the wind.

The renson for adopting this method of testing relates especially
to tho pitching moments, but the results can be used to show the
'\'rr)' in which lift and drag are affected by the variation of the distance
heLwecn tail and wings.
Figure 17 represents the lift and drag for the machine with the
medium and short bodies, each cllrrying the large tnil at an angle
of - 3 to to the wing chord, while figure 18 gives similar data for
(he medium and long bodies in conjunction with the smull tail. In
(he cllse of the first, the lift for tho t,\'O bodies is virtually identical
n t allgles less than 5°. At this point the two lift curves diverge,
(he lift for the short body being the greater, and the divergence
1>(,(;0111eS steadily ~rcater as the an~le of incidence increases until
n L 16° there is a difference in lift 01 over 0 .03 of a pound, so that
1 he lllnding s]?eed would be somewhat reduced by shortening the
hody, quite aSIde from the fact that the weight of the machine would
he' 11l:11'kedly decr eased by a reduction of 10 per cent in the length of
the body.

The drag for the two is identical within the experimental error up
to an angle of 10°, beyond which angle the curves separate in the

In the case of the small tail, the lift is about 0.01 pound more with

either direction from vhcse l?oints will result in a decreased dO'lmwash and increased lift o.;ld or;1.g. It appears that this is what h: s
happened in the :rrescnt cn~c, and it would uncloubt dly be found
thflt, if the body should be shortened up still farther than was done
in the tests with the hrge tllil, the lift would be ::t m:1ximum for some
length, beyond which 11l .y furth er shortening wonl(t diminish it.
The gains in efficiency cOlbequent on shortening the body depend
chiefly on the reduction in Vi'" ight, permitting abo a further reduction in area. The direct ga'u in lift is smail, us it was for chtmges in
the angle of tail setting, although it is by no IDel ns negligible. The
applic, t.ion to other airpla.nes of he results obtained from this
pn.rticular set of tests is not to be recommended, howevor, sil eo the
effect of ChMging the body length might be quite different when a
dillerent mn.chine, using a different wing section, was afIected.
A QUA.'1TITAT!VE DISGCSSIO~ OF THE FORCES ON THE TAIL AKD THE
EFFECTS OF DOWN WASH.

Although we have now examined the char[lcteristic curves for the
complete machine in a con iderable number of cases (11 in all), as
well as for the machine without the tail, we have not yet made any
attempt t o correlo.te the figures for tail effect, or to secure any
measure of the downwash angle, and this subject will bo treated next.
~nough has been done to make it evident tha.t no single figure
or formula can express the degree of downwllsh, which varies with
distance from wings, angle of incidence, type of body, and is not even
the same on all parts of the tail at a given time. Any formulre tha,t
are given, therefore, must be accepted with due reserva.tion, s representnw n. " mean effective" downwash which, if it actually COlTesponde~ t o the conditions of flow, would give rise to the S!1me ta.il
effects as those observed. It is further obvious that the figures
thus secured will not apply to the effects of the tail on tho drag curve,
as tho eddying flow above and behind the tail actually results in its
having a negative drag at times.
In figure 19 are plotted the lifts due to each of the three tails when
attached to the medium body at an angle at - 3 ~ 0 to the wing chord.
The wavy curves, drawn in full lines, pass till:ough all the points vith
tho exception of one or two which were obviously very far orr.
Although the peculiar shape of these curves may be due in some part
t o observational orrors, which would show forth very IDuch exaggerated on such a plot as this, it will bo noted that the curves roughly
parallel each other, u,nd it is probable that the irre~ula.rities represent
approximately a condition actually present. t:3uch irregularities
may be accounted for on the hypothesis sta.ted in connection with
the tests of different body lengths, the lift due to the tu,il varying
in an irregular manner with the angle of incidence, since the length
flnd amplitude of the fluid wa,ves back of the wing change with the
angle, and the position of the tail with respect to the wave form is
consequently altered. As a measure of simplificu,tion, however, and
for possible u se in the framing of empirical rules, ideal curves have
been drawn with all irregularities removed, and these lie within
0.005 pound of the more exu,ct curves at all points. These fai ·ed
plots curve slightly upward, the curvature being greatest l.co,r the
middle of the curve.

from the normal.
The complete machine was tested cmder 11 different cond:'Lo~lS,
as already dc~cribed in detail in connection with liit and dr~'g. The
moments about the spindle were measured with !1 cali~rated torsion
wire, according to the usual procedul'e. Since so much depended
on the flow of air from the wings to the tail and since it WaS cared
that the straight spindle generally employed might unduly intorfere
with this flow, it was discarded and an offsot spllldle, bent through
right angles at three points and passing into the bottom ir--stoad of
the side of the body, was substituted. The positioll chosen 'or the
spindle gave a centor of rotation, about which the moments were
measured, just above the trailing edge of the lower wing. The
moments I1bout the center of gravity were computed by a process
explained in detail by Dr. Hunsaker's pape / and which need not bo
gone into here. The conteI' of gravity has been chosen, in every case,
ill such a position that the machine was in equilibrium at un angle
of incidence of 2°. This necessitl1ted using a different position for
the center of gravity III each case, the extreme movement being about
one-fourth inch on the model, corresponding to 6 inches on tho
m achine.

n
this case the discrepancy with the other curves is vory probably due
t o an error. The stability, represented by the slope of the moment
curve, is always least at or near an angle of incidence of 3°.
The curves speak for themselves, and it is difficult to draw any

FUNDAMENTAL I'llIKCIPLES 0:' D':NAMIC;'.L STABILITY.

Before takin~ up in detail the dynamical stn,bility of the Curtiss
JN3, we shall briefly tabulate, for purposes of r ference, the wellknown principles on which the treatmt'llt of dynamical stability
depends, and shall discuss the methods of npplying tl ose principles.
It has been found by Bryan 1 and oiher im-estigators that the
general equations of motion of an airplano, 'with symmetry taken
il to account, re(Iuce to two sets of equations of the fourth degree
in A, A being the logarithmic increment or dec'l'ement of the oscillation, one of which equations corresponds cO symmetric, or longitudinnl, the other to asymmetric, or litter: 1, oscill tions. The second of
these equations does not enter into the present itl-vestign.tion in any
form, III d we shall not discu s it. Before proceeding to an examination of the first, it is necessary to describe the notation adopted.
The origin is located at the center 0 grn.vity of the airphne.
The three mutually perpendicular n.xes of reference Ilre fL'.:ed lU the
mn.chine in such aJ)osition that they are parallel and perpendicular
to the relative win when the machine is in steady horizontal flie>ht.
They therefore change their position with respect to the earth s
the n.irplane oscillates. When there is !1 change in speed of flight,
however, and consequently in n.ngle of incidence, the axes change
their position in the machine. These axes arc denominated the
x, ?f, and z n.xcs, and the forces pllrallel to them, respectively, re
c:111ed X, Y, and Z. The x axis is parallel to the rehtive win 1,
the ?J axis is parallel to a line connecting the wil g tips, and the
z axis is -vertical. The moments about these axes are denominated,
l'rspecti-vdy, L, M, and J.V. The components oi v-elocity parallyl to
the x, ?I, and z axes are called u, v, and w, and jJ, q, and r, similarly,
nrc the components of angular velocity · bout these axes, Rnd co1'1'esponcliug to the moments L , 31, and 1\ .
It has heen sho:\'n that the longitudinal motion may be considered
s entirely independent of the side slipping velocity v and of tho
nngular yelocities of r oll and yaw-p m d T . This is not stl'icthr
correct ill every case, a side slip having :1 distinct influence on the
dr:lg, nd n. roll affecting both lift and drag, for example, but it is
necessary to make the approxin1l1,tion in order that the equations
of motion may simplify as described above. En.ch of the five coefficients in the biqun.dr atic may then be written as a function of one

COMPUTATIONS OF RESISTANCE DERIVATIVES.

The flrst sLep in comput,ing the resistance derivu..tives for a specific
airplane is to determine X, Z, and}.f for each angle of incidence a.t
which the model was tested, and to plot these against the a.ngle of
pitch away from tho position of equilibrium.. To avoid the appearance of mass in the stl1bility equations, all forces are reduced to
pounds per unit mass. The transformation is made or X and Z
by the application of the equations :
'
X =D cos 8- L sin 8
Z =L cos 8+D sin 8
8 being the anglo of pitch. The method of obtaininG' M has alreiLdy
. been described in the first part of this report, and ~as been carried
through for all the cases under examination for an angle of incidence
of 2° and I1ngles of pitch extending from _6° to + 18°.

The only remaining resitance derivative is Jlq , the damping
coefficient of pitching. This is secured by oscm ting the model in
n. current of air, measuring the time required for the amplitude of
the oscillations to be damped to a certain predote ·mined degree.
The method has been fully described elsewhere,l and will not be gone
in to hero.
The solution of the equation of motion for the oscillator reduces to:

log. ~ =~, where t is the time required to damp the angle of swing
from 00 to e and I is the moment of inertia of the entire oscillating
mn s, calculated by timing the periods of oscillation with the oscillator
counterweights in two different positions, and eliminating the effect
of the springs between the two equations thus secured . The maximum amplitUde of oscillation is about 3° each side of the equilibrium
position.
Bairstow has shown 2 that fJ" the damping coefficient, is a function
of pl'v where I is any linear dimension of the machine, tlus deduction
being bused on a strict proportionality between the air forces and
the square of the speed. The above relation, in so far as it states
that the damping coefficient varies as the first power of the speed,
is in close accord with the results obtained by oscilb,ting experiments at different speeds for the complete model of :m airplane; but
the dampin(; coefTieIent for the apparatus alone varies with the speed
in a highly IrreguInr manner, being nearly constant at speeds of from
20 to 35 miles per hour, beyond which points it changes rapidly.
This behavior is in accordance with that indicated by previous tests
wiLh the same apparatus, as is shown by the positions of the observed
points with respect to their curves, although it has always been
le'sumed that the discrepancies from a straight line were caused by
oxperimental errors, and such a line was drawn through an average
of Lho points . In the present experiments, since fJ, for the complete
mou lIS considered to be directly proportional to the speed, a mechanical method of fairing the curve and obtaining Jfq has been substituted for tho devico of plotting all the points and drawing the line
by eye, as has formerly been the custom. fJ, \vas found for each
enso at seven diiIerent speeds, ranging from 12 to 39 miles an hour,
nnd was divided by the speed of test, thus giving the damping coeflicil'IlL at 1 mile an hour. An average of the seven values obtained
for the even different speeds was then taken to be the true value

This method also has t 1C advantage that the mean deviation of the
individu:11 values from the average gives an excellent quantitative
measure of the accuracy of the run. This deviation \\'t s almost
alwa.ys found to be less than 4 per cent. Ha.ving found this unit

of the scale of the model and by the speed] di\-iding by the m ss of

SOLUTIO~

O· THE STABIL TY EQUATIO~.

Since the motion is oscillatory] the roots of the biquadratic stability equation will be complex] and will occur in pairs. The substitution of any root in the expression y=e·/.t gives the product of an
exponential] the exponent corresponding to the real part of the
root, and a trigonometric expression invOiving both sine and cosine,
and therefore having the period 2.. ] the magnitude of the angles (in
radians) corresponding to the imaginary p:1rt of tho root. In order
that tho motion may be a. damped ono, the real parts of a.ll the roots
must be negative, and tl:e condition for this is, as clemonstr!1.ted by
Routh \ that all the coefficients in the equation: A}..'+B;V+0}..2+
D}..+E=O] must be positive] and that the expression BOD-ADzB2 E] known as Routh's discriminant] must also be positive. The
magnitude of Routh]s discriminant is frequently taken as :1 criterion
of the degTee of stability, but it is not entirely satisfactory for this
purpose, as will be shown later.
Bairstow has shown 2 that tl is equation can be so bctored us to
give approximately correct roots] since the values of the cocfticients
do not vary widely in modern airplanes of standard type. The
solution is as follows:

(}..Z+~}..+~) (}..z+[g_ ~!~}+~)=O
The first factor corresponds to a short and heavily dumped oscillation] the second to one of much longer period. If there is any
instability, it appears in the latter motion. It is evident that] if
the second motion is to be stable, ~ -~~ must be positive, and OD
must therefore be greater than BE. This is a somewhat simpler,
although less absolutely correct, criterion than is the use of Routh]s
discriminan t.

Bair"t.ow's solution is therefore never perfecdy correct, but it is close
ellourrh nt all times to be of great value, which is all that has ever
he('n 0 claimed for it.
It hns already been stated that Routh's discriminant is not a.
sati fnctory measure of stability. A better quantity for this pm-posa
cnn he obtained in the following manner.
The most satisfactory basis for a . ingle e. 'pression defining tho
degree of stability, is the percentage of <1; mping dm-ing one complete
o. ('illation . A large value for this cxpres iOll 1S to be desired, as it
inyol ~es heavy damping in combination with a long period, both of
which make for comfort and safety. The damping in one oscillation
depends on the ratio of the period to the time l'equired to damp the

A word of caution is necessary to the effect that this does not furnish a
means of distinguishing degrees of instability, and that, of two machines
gi\-ing negative values, the one for which the value is algebruically
lItrg st (nearest to zero), may be the more unstable of the two. Only
po iLive values, therefore, should be taken into account. To minImize the efIect of instability it is desirable th t the product of the

DYNAMICAL STABILITY OF THE CURTISS JN2.

The resistance derivatives were computed and the stability disCllS rcl for Meh of the 11 difl'erent combinations of body and tail
which \\'e1'e made up. The machine was also placed on the oscillator
without a tail, in order to determine the amount of damping, or the
proportion of 1\I Q' due to the winO's, body, and chassis. It would,
however, have been useless to mD,1;::e complete stability calculations
in this condition, as it is obvious that a machine which is unstable
in a statical sense can not possess dynamical stability. The calculations have all been made, as in the case of tho statical 'Work and
tho reduct.ion of the center of gravity, for an angle of incidence of
2°, corresponding to a speed of slightly over 60 miles per hour.
Investigations by Dr. J . C. Hunsaker 1 have sho'wn that the degree

angle of incidence due to the pitch. If the truth of this hypothesis
be admitted, the damping moments should vary as the square of the
distance from the tail to the center of gravity, and should also he
proportional to the area of the tail. In geometrically similar mitchines, therefore, the damping coefficient should vary as the fourt:'"
power of a linear dimension, a. bet which has a.lready been ·em. rked.
In varying the length of the body and the size of the tail simultaneously in accordance with the convention which we adopted, the clamping coefficient should be directly proportion::u to the length of the
body, and it will be seen that this represents the actual condition
within the limits 0 . e.·perirocntal elTor if allowance is ma, e fo . the f· et
that the damping docs not all arise from the ta,il. A quantitative
discussion of this pO.i nt (t~le distribution of damping between the
elements of the m chme) will be entered on at another place. When
the tail area alone is changed the damping increases with area, i11deed, but the increase in damping, especially when the brge t!1il is
substituted for the medium one, appears to be consider' b1y more
r apid than that in area. The changing of body length alone also
causes a variation in damping mom en t more rapid thl1u would be indicated by a strict adherence to proportion·lity to the square of the
leno-th.
l'7he most striking feature of the damping coefficients, however,
is their variation with angle of tail settmg. In every ese, even
before any fairing was attempted, the value of 1.1q increased w'ith the
angle between the ta.il and the wings, a result whIch is in direct COl travention of the damping hypothesis which we have alre.:1dy described. It has never been conclusively demonstrated however,
that the for ce on a plate at a fi.....:ed angle of incidence is t h same s
e
the instan taneous force when the angle of incidence is constantly varying,' and i t may be that there is an inherent dumping force arising
directly from a change in the type of field of :/low. Such a force
would U1J.doubtedly ,\, ry ,,-ith the magnitude of the direct force on
the t ail, and would ;:here:~)!'e gi'\e the obser'\eu result.
CO~.IPUTATION

OF KB'.

The r adius of gyration under each case was computed on the following assumptions :
( 1) Changes in tail :1ngle have no effect.
(2) 111e weight of the tuil is proportional to the area.
(3) The weight of the body is propor tional to its length (for small
v ariations) .
(-1) The radius of gyration of the part of the body behind the center
of o-ravity is proportional to its length.
(5) The difference between the moments of inertia of the various
tails about their own respective centers of gravity is negligible.
T he r adius of gyration for the J~2 in its standard arrangement has
been very carefully calculated, and the computation has been checked
by swinging the complete machine/ the result being very nearly
5.S feet.
A tabulation of the other cases, as calculated from the standard
radius of gyration and the assumptions above, follows :

percentage of damping in Olle osci1lation decreases somewhat, so
that the net effect of such changes may be considered to be unf VOl'able. An increase in tail angle bring'S about a considen ble increase in

There wo.s a gener!11 tendency to decrease both period and damping

A comparison of Cases V, X, and XI ~ows tho.t tho period increases
as the length of the body is increased, the tail nren. being correspondingly decreased . The damping time, on the other hand, is o.bsolutely identico.l for all three cnses. When the body length in increo.sed
withou t changing the tail area there is, again, surprisingly little
change. Such as there is is a general improvement, through a ler gthen in g of period, a decrease 0 damping time, or both .
In short, it appears that considerable modifications can be made
in the size, placing, nd an ngement of the tail surf ces without
serious adverse effect on dynamical longitudinal tability at moderato
and high speeds, and that these details may be chosen primarily
from the standpoints of weight, aerodynamic efficiency, maneuverability, an d the possession of a sufficient degree of sta.tic stability
to insure 0. moderately r apid recovery from a nose-dive or other
abnormal attitu de. The needs of lateral stability, too, must be kept
in mind when changing the length of body.
P HYSICAL CONCEPTIOJ. S OF THE RESISTANCE DERIVATIVES.

By appropriate alterations in design, almost all the derivatives
can be slightly varied one at a time and without substantial change
in the others . To determine what these alterations should be, the
most straightforward method is to assume variations in en.ch of the
derivatives singly, and to calculate the effects of such deviations on
the long oscillation . At the same time, it is of the highest inlportance
to h ave a physical conception of the nature of the derivatives, as a
check on the conclusions derived from a purely mathematical tre!1tment . The basis for such physical conceptions has been e:A--pounded
with particular clearness by Dr. J . C. Hunsaker.l
(a) 1.I w , the statical moment derivative, represents the change in
pitching moment with vertical velocity. If the airplane rises, the
r elative wind ha.s a downward component, and the angle of incidence
is diminished. If J.1w is positive, it will tend to head the airplane
up . Conversely, if the airplane drops the relative wind has an
upwar d slope, the angle of incidence is decreased, and since w is now
n egative, N w will tend to head the machine down. The effect of a
p ositive Mw is ther efore to maintain the airplane always at the same
angle to the wind. If Mw is v ery large, it tends to pro uce v iolen t
oscillations with a shor t period, the condition being analogous t o

It is evident that the effect of increusing ..:1110 is wholly unfavorable,
the period being shortened and the damping decreased. The third

A reduction of ]110 to approximately 2.00 withot. much effect on
any other derivative could be secured by the use 0 a tail half way

REPORT :SATIOXAL ADvISORY COl\DfITTEE FOR AERO:SAUTICS.

Increases in the damping coefficient have exactly the opposite effect
to sinular c11a.nO"('s in ..:liw , uecreasing the damping time :1.Tlcllengtl ening the period. 0 Con iclcrable alterations can, however, be made without senously altering the nature of the motion . E,en when the
dampiJ1g co ffi.elent is reduced to hnlf its normnl value, a change
which would hardly 1e brought about by any modifica.tion short or
the complete removal of the tail, the motion is still not uncomfortt"bly
nolent, although the stability is much deCl·eased, and the critical
speed for instability would be considerably higher th~ n that for the
standard machine. When M q is still further reduced to zero the
machine is still stable, althou~h now only slightly so. Since damping
depends more on size of tail tll:1D. on angle, :Alq can be increased without changing Mw by increasinl$ the size of the tail, and, "hat is even
more important, the length ot the body, while decreasing the, ngle
of the tail to the wings. A broad, flat-bottomed body a.lso contributes
to damping.
(c) Xu represents the change in X with changing forward velocity.
It is evident from a physical standpoint that this should be negative
and as lar&e as possible, so that any tendency to change speed will be
immediatelY counteracted. Xu depends solely on the drag at 0° of
pitch, and a high ~ ratio is therefore unfavorable to stability. M~ king
a quantitative study, we find that an increase of 10 per cent in Xv.
has no effect on the period, and decreases the damping time from
13.5 seconds to 12.4. A decrease of 50 per cent, corresponding to
doubling the ~ ratio, still leaves the period virtually una.ffected, but
increases the damping time to a trifle under 20 seconds, so that the
damping in one oscillation is lowered from 64 per cent to barely 50.
Among the five coefficients of the biquadratic, Xu enters into 13, 0,
and D, but its efect on B is too small to be perceptible, and it influences the value of D much more than that of O.
(d) Xw should be hrge and~ositive for stability, as is evident
from physical considerations. When the machine, in the course of
its oscillation, starts to rise, it is desirahle that a force be set up which
will oppose the forward motion, thus decreasing the speed and checking the rise. The result of changing this derivative has been examined in the same manner as for the others already treated.

Here, too, as in the case of Xu, the effect is shown mainly by il.
lengthening of the damping time when the derivil,tive deere! ses.
The change is rebtively smail, but ma.y be of some importance when
the degl·ee of change is very large, as it is apt to be. "When tho angle
of incidence deCl'eases and the speed decreases Xw drops oil' \yith
great rapidity, actually becoming negative as the criticnl speed is
approached, and it is to the rapid change of this derivative that at
least a part of the instability a.t large angles of incidenco ma.y be
ascribed.
The means of controlling the behavior of .Xw may best be shown
by a brief ma.thematical investigation. We have already shown that

It will be noticed that an increase in Z70 lengthens the period and
decreases the damping time, thus markedly improving the stability.
Zw, like X w , drops off rapidly as the angle of incidence is increase ,
and this is another of the elements contributing to instability at
low speeds. Ex mining Zw in the same manner previously employed,
we see that it is proportional to :~ + D, the first term being by far
the more important. Z70 will then maintain its original high value
best for machines in which the burble point is "sharp," the lift
curve running up on a constant slope to within a fraction of a degree
of the critical angle and then breaking suddenly. This behavior is
characteristic of thick win~ sections, such as are used for propener
blade elements. A sharp ourble point, however, has certain disadvantages, such III chines being subject to stalling and exceedingly
sensitive at angles of incidence near the critical ang1e.
We have now examined, one by one, the effect of each of the
resistance derivatives, with the exception of ZU. It is quite usC'less
to treat this one, as it is a function of the speed alone and nothing
can be done to modify its value. The next step, therefore, is to
investigate the influence of the radius of gyration on stability.

The effect is surprisingly small, especially in respect of period of
oscillation, which might be expected to vary largely with K/.
TAT e can say without hesitation that no variation of the radius of
gyration which will arise in practice will have a perceptible effect on
the stability of
machine, and that the only importance of this
quantity appears in connection with maneuverability and quickness
of response to controls.
The only important quantity remaining to be investigated is the
speed. For treating this we have adopted the assumptlOn that the
wei~ht of the machine, and consequently the loading, is chan~ed
witnout changing the aerodynamic properties in any way and that
the radius of gyration also remains unaltered~ .the effect being the
same as if the weight of every part of the machine were to be scaled
down in the same proportion. The mass of the machine will then
be proportional to the square of the speed the flight attitude being
the same in each case.
Each of the si..x derivatives, under these conditions, varies inversely
as U. Thus, for example:

1l1q !X--;m:-Z U2 !X u
The five coefficients in the stability equation then vary as follows:

It is evident that, for a given flight, attitude, stability is improved

mainly in the form of increased damping, the pe iod being
but little affected. This can be very simply explained on purely
physie:ll grounds. The lower the speed of the airplane the (5reater,

ELEMENTS CONTRIBUTING TO DAMPING.

In order to make an analysis of this topic the model was tested on
the oscillator with the tail removed, usino- both the medium and
short bodies. The damping coefficient for the wings and short body
WIlS found to be 0.000067, and that for the wings and medium body
0.000070, as against a value of 0.000385 for the complete machine
wilh medium body and medium tail at - 3~o. The tail thus furnishes 82 per cent of the damping for the standard arrangement and
~ 1 per cent of that for the combination of short body and i arge

a stable center of pressure motion would greatly increase the dumping
due to the ,,-ings.
The damping due to the tail was cnlculn.ted for the aU'cPlune itself
at ~ speed corresponding to an angle of incidence of 2 , and W: S
found to be 117 units for tho medium tail in combination with the
medium body, and 111 for the 1m'go tail in combination with tho
short body. An indcpende11t. computation of damping due to the
tail, based on the cllstomary assumption that the t!l.il ac.ts as a flat
plate at nn angle of incidence derived from i s resultant p~th, has also
been made. The en ch,e n pect ratio of the t:1il \\':1S n-Sl med to be
3, as indicated bv tLe tests of the tail alone described in the fl.rst part
of the report, and. due allowance was made for the portion of the t<1.il
in contact with the body.
The values obt incd by such computations were 79 and 72, ]'0spectively. These, are very Dearly t,\'o-thirds of the valnes found hy
experiment, and the remaining third of the dl1.moing must be derived
from some other s urce. The discrepancy is, in fact, considern.bly
more than a third, as wo hU\Te already found that, due to dccreased
air-speed and the extreme complexity of flow behind the wings, the
forces on a tail 0.1'0 much smaller than those obtained by compntatio 1
from the flat-phte formula. The additional moment m y well be
accounted for by the hypothesis, mentioned l. bove, of a dissipation
of energy in modifying the field of flow abont :1 pIn.to at :1 constantly
chan~.ing angle of inCIdence. Tl1e damping computed from the size
and cUstance of tho tail can be used as a basis for a stability estimate,
proceedin~ on the assumption that the computed value forms 55
per cent or the whole 11q .
AN INVESTIGAT 0

T

OF LOW-SPEED CONDITIONS.

Since, as has alrcady heon noted, typical machines become unstable at low speeds, an investigation of theso conditions hilS been
added. The angle of incidence chosen for this study w' s 12°, at
which the investigation of Dr. J. C. Hunsaker showed the Curtiss
IN-2 to be slightly unstable. As there was not sufficient; time to
carry out experiments on the oscillator at this angle, jJlq was assumed
to be du'ectly proportionul to the speed of the machine, an assumption which. br. Hunsaker's experiments indicate to represent the
facts fairly closely, but to be rather less favorablo to stability than
the true conditions, . s jJIq actually diminishes somewhat less rapidly
than does the speed.
Thc resistanco deriv:1tives have been computed as before and aro
tabulated below, followed by the coefficients of the stability equation
and the period and time to damp 50 per cent for the long oscillator,

The results at low speed are less accur~te than at high, and the
yalues of X w, which depends on the difference of two nearly equ
quantities, can not be depended on within 15 or 20 per cent.
The fact that the machine ,vas found to be stable (although only
sliahtly so), whereas Dr. Hunsaker found the same machine under
th~ same conditions to be slightly unstable, is accounted for by the
braer values of Xw and ZlO obtained in the present experiments,
and the e, in tum, were probably due to slight differences in wings of
the model employed . A comparison of the characteristic curves of
fi"urc 6 with Dr. Hunsaker's curves will show that the former approximOates much more nearly than the latter to the form (A), in firure 35,
which was stated to be conducive to stability, and that the lift curve
in the present report has the "sharper" burble point.
The difference between the cases is slight, and there is nothing
to invalidate the conclusions and recommendations drawn from the
high-speed and statical analyses . The stability with the large tail
is somewhat poorer than with the other two, due to a lower value of
X w , which counterbalances the larger ]'/lq . This slight disadvantage
cnll readily be overcome, however, by a modification of the form of
wings and body ..
An increase in tail an~le shor tens the period, exactly as at high
speeds . Changes in the length of body, within the limits adopted,
have no harmful effects .
There seems no reason to doul;>t the possibility of developing,
without radical changes from the present designs, an airplane which
will possess a satisfactory degree of longitudmlll dynamic stability
at all speeds within the range of possibilIty, and to do this without
sacrificing, to a serious ex tent, aerodynamic efficiency or any other
desirable quality.

SUMMARY O' RESULTS OF STATICAL INVESTIGATION.

1. The Eifl'el 36 wing, with raked tips and aspect ratio 7.2, gave a
maximum LID of 21 and a maximum ~, of 0 .00315 .
2. The aerodynamic forces on the body are not perceptibly changed
by considerable changes in the length and abruptness of the run, or
portion of the body in back of the largest cross section.
3. At the ano-Ie of minimum resist::mce, the drag of body and chassis
together is slig~tly less than double that due to the body alone.
4 . The mean biplane lift cOlTection recommended for finding
minimum flight-spced is 0 .95 . At small angles and high speeds
correction factors of from 0.82 to 0.86 were found .
5. The lift contributed by body chassis, and tail at large angles is
negligible. At angles below 10° these elements exert a considerable
neg: tive lift.
6. The coefficient of parasite resistance varies less than 20 per cent
bet\\·ccn 0° and gO . Its minimum value for the Curtiss IN- 2, including
interpbno bracing, is 0.02 pounds per mile per hour.
7. The drag contributed by body lllld chassis, in the presence of
thc wings, is roughly three-fifths of that indicated by a test of these
clemcn ts alone.
8. The gain in efficiency from a decrease of the angle between tail
and wings is exceedingly small, a change of 2tO in the tail angle
increasing the maximum speed by only 1 mile per hour, and decrcasiug tho landing speed by one-half mile per hour.
9. Ordinary cnanges in tail area do not fl'ect the landing speed
perceptibly. The h1gh speed is somewhat improved by increasing
tail Ill" 11. .
10. Shortening the body of the IN-2 reduces the landing speed
without affectino- the wah speed .
11. The draa ~ue to the tail is very small except at large angles,
and actually d;:ops to a negative value under some conditions .
12 . The fi.n~le of tail setting can be much dccreased without serious
loss of statica.L stability.
13 . The center of gravity of the airplane is placed, for equilibrium,
from 4 to 18 inches forward of the mean center of pressure of tho
wi.ngs. This distance is greatest when the angle of equilibrium is
smUll and the angle of tail setting is large

SUMMARY OF RESULTS FOR DYNAMIC STABILITY.

I

"

/

1 . M q , the dampinO' coefficient in pitch, increases very rapidly
with the size of the tait and with the length of the body. It increases
slightly with tho angle of tail setting.
2 . An increaso in tail angle decreases the period of oscillation and
the damping in one period.
3. Increased tail area shortens the period and increases the
dampinO'.
4 . In~reasing the length of body increases the stability slightly.
5. To secure a maxin1Um of dynamical stability at high speed, all
the resistance erivatives except ],fw shoul be larO'o in ab:-,olu io
value. ]'1.0 should be as small as is consistent with a sufficient
degree of statical righting moment.
6. To secure these conditions, it is recommended that the angle
between tail and wings be much decreased. A considerable shortening, of the body is permissible if accompanied by an increase in the
tau area which will keep the moment of area about the center of
gravi!y of the machine constant.
7. ~ighty-two per cent of the damping moment is contributed by
the tail. The damping moment computed for the tail in accordance
with the usu al theory is about two-thirds of that found by exp ·iment. It is recommended, forjreliminary estimates, that the damping due to the tail be compute and assumed to be 55 per cent of the
correct value for the whole machine .
