INTRODUCTION.

The main object for which these experiments were conducted was the development of a
new method of producing high-grade aviation gasoline. Of almost equal importance was the
problem of increasing the yield over existing practice, and aIso of reducing the cost of production.
The experimental plant was established at C!ldestin, W. Vs., and owes ita origin ta the
offer made to the Government during 1917and accepted by the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautic early in 1918for the erection of a test laboratory.
The installation consisted of a suitable building and equipment, inchding a six-horsepower
“ Foos” gas engine, a Mm Brunswiok ammonia compressor, high-pressure tanks, condensers,
separators, pressure gauges, etc., which, together with our services, were offered to the Government without remuneration.
PRESENT METHODS.

The univerd method of producing gasohne consists of boiling orude oil in a stall, &niIar
ta the boiIing of water in a kettle, the vapor arising from the oil being passed through a condenser, whioh consists of a series of pipes lying in a trough of moving water, the water phqning
the part of oooling the oil vapors, and thus condensing them into liquid which is ramoved to
a cleaning outit where it is treated with sulphuric aoid to remove the Unsaturate or oracked
products. Stdphuric acid has a great af6nity for cracked parafiins such as are produced in
gasoline distillation.
The temperature at whioh the tit drop of gasoline oondenses from the distihtion of crude
oil differs according to the age of the oil field from which the ozude oil has been obtained, and also
according to the length of time it has stood uncovered she its pumping from the well. Crude
oil from the Pennsylvania or West vii
fields wilI start to boil at 80° F. to 100°F.; and
the fit drop of condensation will be found at about that temperature. This is known as the
initiaI boiIing point.
The temperature of the still is then gradually raised until it reaoh= the i%rnperature at
which it is desired to “cut” off the distillate. This is known as the end point or final boiling
point. This lattar temperature is controlled by the oommerciil side of the dierpriae, i. e.,
the supply and demand for gasoline. At 302° F. as a fhd boiling or end point the end of
the real volatile products is reached; and they are about to enter the illuminating or btig
oil distillates. Most of the commercial gasolines have an end point of 450° F. This is an indication of gasoline containing a large quantity of kerostme. The higher the temperature of the
end point the larger quadity of unsaturated hydrocarbons will be found before cleming.
It is the practice to clean the gasoline and remove the unsaturated hydrocarbons by a
solphuric acid treatrmnt, removing most of the acid, neutwdizing the remaining aoid bald in
suspension by the gasoline by the use of an alkalij md washing with water. The acid absorbs
the unsaturated hydrocarbons, thereby producing sdphones whioh in turn are washed with
watar.

It is our conviction that a gasoline which hss not been in touch with an acid will have
decided advantagea over one which has. It is also our conviction that a gaaohne produced
without a heat treatment, such as the distillation at present universally practiced at oil
refineries, would be free from cracked or unsaturated hydrocarbons, thereby eliminating the
necessity for such acid treatment. A series of experiment have lately bca conducted with
the folIowing results:

DESCRIPTION

ADVISORY COMMI!t’1’BE FOR AERONAblWS.

OF PEOCES+S USED IN EXPERIMENTS.

Crude oil or benzine was placed in a closed tank which was supplied with heat from a gas
burner sufficient to maintain the temperature at around 2000 F. Natural gas at a pressure
of about 100pounds and a temperature approximately 150°F. WM allowed to bubble through
the oil and thereby absorb the vapors of the lower boiling point hydrocarbons contained in
the crude petioleum. This charged gas, at its thm reduced pressure of about 10pounda passed
to a single cylinder refrigeration machine and was compressed to about 125pounds per square
inch. During the compression stroke a small quantity of glycerine was sprayed into the cylinder
by means of the high gas pressure on the delivery side of the compressor, and mixed with the.
gas and hydrocarbon vapors therein. The compressed gas, with ita then condensed and
entrained gasoline, pks the injected glycerine, pawed through a settling tank where the most
of the glycerine and some of the gasoline were deposited, and then through a water-cooIed condenser where the most of the remaining gasoline vapors were condensed. A separator was
next in line and seryed to remove the condensed g~oline from the gas which latter was then
pained through a reheater where its temperature wss raised to around 200” F. by transfer of
the heat of the exhaust game from the gas engine which operated the refrigerating mmhine.
This reheated natural gas then again passed to the tank containing the crude matm-ial and
so completed the cycle.
During tlm experiments a small amount of the natural gas was lost by leakage or otherwise and it was necessary to admit more to the sydmn from time to time. The glycerine which
was injected into the compressor cylindw served to aid the cold water circulating through the
comprmsor cylinder j acketa to abstract the heat of comprewion and maintain the temperature of the compressed gas and vapors at a low point. The amount of gasoline vapor condensed
from the charged gas as the result of the compression was thereby increased. The low tempcr~
ture of the gas and gasoline vapors also obviated any material cracking or chemical breaking
down of the various hydrocarbons contained. It is SISObelieved that the glycerine was to
a certain extent instrumental in remo~
by absorption some of the impurities contained in
the gasoline vapors as received in the compression cylinder.
The experiments were not carried fax enough to determine the ultimate poseib$ties of
the glycerine injection procaw as a means of remotig water, sulphur, snlphur compounds,
and other impurities from the gasoline. The apparatus used was assembled from material
readily available on the market, so that the results do not repreeent the economic value of
th~ distillation proces9.
A complete description of the several modifications of the fundamental process damibed
in the above note is contained in patent specification No. 193624, filed September 28, 1917, and
entitled ‘ ‘Procms of cleaning and refining distillates of petroleum. ”
