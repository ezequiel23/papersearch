The Subdivided Wing Sectioti.
In accordance with the Bernoulli equation, lift is a result of the formation of layers in a circulating current with
forward movement of a cambered surface. The separation of
the streamlines at the top side of a plate placed obliquely to
the direction of the current results in a vacuum between an
upper surface of discontinuity and the front of the top side,
and this vacuum is filled with harmful eddies.

It shows a

cambered section above the l’critical
angle of attack”.

IN

THE SUBDIVIDED PROFILE, the diagram of the current is entirely changed and the harmful formation of eddies is avoided
through premature deflection. Pressure equalization DOES NOT
OCCUR between the upper and under sides.

“There is no occas-

ion to fear diminution of the velocity on the top side, as
the entire profile system is to be considered as a STAGGERED
MULTIPLANE with independent single sections when there is
sufficiently large SPACING of the dividing surfaces. The form
of the transverse section is chosen in such a manner that the
top outlet groove narrows down opposite the bottom one.”

acceleration of the streamlines, new partial pres-

.,sures arise through the CAMBERED lower side of the divided
profile and add to the resuiting total pressure.1’ It has not,
so far, been possible to prove this in practice in Germany.
The HANDLEY PAGE tests confirm the theoretical expectations
entertained, in spite of the extremely imperfect and contestable arrangement of those tests. With six divided surfaces,
a GAIN of 200$ to 300fiin LIFT was expected. Wind-tunnel
measurements made ‘atthe British N.P.L. also confirm the increase of lift with more acute angles of attack. There is no
considerable increase of resistance in such case, and the tendency to KIGRATION OF THE CENTER OF PRESSURE IS NOT INCREASED
TO ANY IMPORTANT DEGREE.
Tests on Engine Cars.
These tests were chiefly carried out during the war, not
but to the extent required by various

These values correspond - according to

the scale of the model’- to various vaiues of the full-sized

The fi~st series, a car model

1 : 5,

from the Technical

Direction of Military Aviation, was measured at the parallelogram balance and further verified at the Eiffel balance. The
resistance was shown to be proportional to the square of the
velocity.

The measurements were taken at various angles of

attack and torque.
to (DTAlf)5,
The second series consisted of models (DTJIbQ
two with a square cross-section and two with a rectangular
cross-section, alternately; and one of each of these two has
a long engine shaft and a short one, also alternately. By this
arrangement, the components are unsymmetrical. There was less
resistance in the case of the short forms, butat

angles be-

yond 10° (or 200 for rectangular forms) the resistance was
greater. The resistance of the long square model is greater
than that of the rectangular model; for the short square model,
however, up to an.angle of 20° only. The long square fuselage
always presents greater resistance than the short rectangular
form.

The resistace of the long rectangular fuselage exceeds

that o~ the short square one at angles of attac$ not greater
than 20°.

All this can be explained by resolving the resist-

ante into form and angle.

The equation of lifting forces gives

correspending resuits.
The same models compose the third series of tests, but they
are here BLOWN AGAINST FROM BEHIND, at the Eiffel balance. The
influence of length is noticeable at high velocities, only, in
this case, owing to the unfavorable wash at the end of the engine, which now lies with the wind. This position is more favorable for the short models.
The resistance is proportional to the squareof the velocity between 25 and 40 m.p.sec.
With regard to the resistance of the different forms, the
above statements may be applied, though the cross-sectional
measurements are more marked in this case. The more acute the
angle of attack, the greater is the influence of length in so
far as lifting power is concerned.

In opposition to the re-

sistance, the lifting power is lower with the long square fuselage than in the case of the rectangular form, as also when
the short models have greater angles.
The inverse position is more favorable for the long, square
form at and belowan

angle of 5°, and it is still more so for

the short form. This is proved by the profile effect of the
two halves of the model.

The shape is of greater influence

the critical angle is smaller.
Fourth series: Caaing for TWO ENGINES on the scale of
1 : 10 (ISA)l, also examined at the Eiffel balance.

The coef-

ficient of resistance diminishes with increased velocity.
