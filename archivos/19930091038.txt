2 MANNEROF PRODUCING
THE MOVEMENT
OF A BODY RELATIVE
TO THE AIR WHICESURROUNDST—BODYMOVABLE.
I
Various experimental methods may be utilized in order to produce
the movement of a body in reference to free air.
In an indefinite m- of air, at rest as a whole, the following types
of movement maybe given to the-bed :
(a) A movement of rectilinear tranJ ation~
(b) A movement of rotation about the ams of a mechanism;
(c) An oscillating movement, as in the case of a pendulum.
The methods by means of some form of mechanism or by means
of a pendulum have been but”Iittle employed in France and we shall
omit special referance to them.
The method employing the motion of translation may be applied
in two$fOrnla
:
(1) The body is allowed to fall freely in air, as calm as possibk.
- (2) The body is carried on some form of car whioh is moved in calm
air.

In Franca the method of free fall has g@n rise to important invesati~us made by MM. CaiUetetand (Xkrdeau and espemdly by M. G.
!&
Th~ method by means of a wtr is now utilized by the Aerodynamic
, at the laborato
of military aerostation of
Institute of Saintr
Chakis-Meudon, an also by M. the D $7 e of Guiche. At Saint-Cyr
T
and at-Chalaie-Meudon, the car is composed of a carriage mowing on
rails. M’. de Guiche employs an automobile a+ a carrier.
A vari~} of the method of the car has been mstaUed at the laboratory of nuhta aviation at Viicenne.s. Gn a stretched cable a little
kmgi.ng car ro , c?*,
3s
attached beIow it, the objccta under test
with the necessary instruments.
The dimensions of the bodies on which the experiments are carried
out may be of the order of those which are utilized in aviation itself.
In other words,- it is possible to operate upon equi mcnt as used in
actual aviation, or at least presenting dimensions J’iffering but lit tk
from those used in practice.
From this pointrof view the method by displacement through the
air opens up a field of investigation more extended than the method
in which an articial current of air is employed.

This method, furthermore, may be subject to certain variations:
(a) The body under inv~tigation alone is placed in the incIosure
m the interior of which the artificial current of air is produced.
The apparatus for measuring the reactions of the air are on the
exterior of this rnclosure, their connection with the interior being
made thro h the soIid WSIIwhich Iimita the conduit.
This me % od is known under the muqe of the “tunnel method.”
It has not been ]arge~y employed in France. There exists at the
present time at the Aerodynamic Institute of Saint-@r a tunnel
of which the practid use has been interrupted by the resent war.

It is for

current of air.
From the point of view of the convmience of carrying on the
experinmmts,especially in large numbers, the kst method is superior
to the method by displac~t
in free air. The latter demands,
in fact, that the external air shall be as calm as tible.. This condition can only be realized on certain days and t%0 only for certain

But many imwtigations, notably those of M. Maurain at the
Aerotechnic Institute of Saint4&e, show that at any given poiit
in the air the wind is freqneutly subject to continued changes in
direction and intensity.
But even if it allows the experimenter to regulate the conditions
of any one investigation, the method b the use of the artificial
current of air can only be applied to mo z ek reduced in size in comariaon witi actual practice m aviation. ‘We shalI see later the reason

I

The methods which we have just considered require that the body
under investigation be connected in a iixed manner with a support.
The latter has, under good conditions, ita dimensions reduced as
much es possible. It is also removed as far as possible from the
body under investigation, so that ita presence will produce the minimum of disturbance. It is none the lws true, however, that the
airplane, thus studied, is not in the precise condition of free evolution
in the o emair.
For tL “ reason invwtigatione have been undertaken on “ lanes
during their free flight in the air. U~ortuna@y,
the field o SUCII

the experimenter; that is to say, of the piIot, who must. fit of all
guard

often & cubof analysis. FTeverth w it can not be x tied that
2
such results may have a very considerable practicaI value.
Exp6rimenta of this character were inaugurated in 1910 by MM.
Gaudart and Legrand with a Voisin biplane. These mporlmcnte
werg, however, neither suflkiently systematic nor numerous to load
to s@cant
resndte.
“b otherwise are the researches made by Commander Dorand,
at T illacoublay, on a biphme of his own construction iloted by M.
Labouch&e. At the Institute of Saint-Cyr, MM. #ouswaint and
Lep&e, Toussaint and the Lleutanant of Aviation Gouin, havo mado
im ortant experiments on a. Maurice F.arman biplane and on a
Bl&iot mono lane. Ing6nious a pitratiii capable of registering the

Let us return to the methods which, in a laboratory, ma be
employed in determining the resistance of the air upon a bo Jy in

With regard to the method of measuring this rosistanca two types
may be characterized:
(1) Determination, by means of a bahmce, of the total rc.sistance
on the entire body under investigation.
(2) Determination, at each point of the body, of the reaction
?xer@d by the air at th+ point; a study, in some manner topo a@the rcssures resulting from the r3 atlve

of the com lete resistance of the sir.

in the Iaboratmy of hf. EHel and at the Instrtute of Saint4yr.

Such is t%e general classification of the experimental methods at

these investigations in a Y

This method which consists in plac”
a model in the cylinder of

cautions:
(1) It-is nwessary that the model should be placed in a mass of

(2) It is very neceesary that the model under investigation shall
be practically isolated in the current of air; that is to say that the
support of the model shall play only a negligible rde and &all introduce no perturbations of import~ce.

(3) It is neoeeary that the model adoptad shall not be too small in
size if it is desired to extend in a more or less significant manner the
results obtained with such model to full-sized ap~watus.
In fact, when a study is made of the distribution of preseure over
the various ointa of a late, for exam 19, either on the face direotly
d ta &e action oF the currentto ! SW,or on the revere face it
~wmd that this distribution becomes regdar only at a certain &tance from the border. There exists, both in front and “b&in& a
central zone in which a regular regimen is estiiblishec$which is manifwt by isobsm arallel to the forward edge. Jmorder that this central zone may { e studied, it is necessary that the dimensions of the
plate under inves~ation be sufhiently large. h fact the width of
the margimil zone m which the =ures
are irregular~y distributed
does not vary ro ortionall wi the dimensions of the plate. The
experiments ofhf!’de Gui~e ~w that ti width vari~ but little

condition have a sensibly constant width, equal to 20 centimeters
. (7.88 inches) in frontiand to 40 or 50 centimetwa (15.76 h 19.7inohes)
at the rear. He concludw that it is well not to o crate with planes
having as read less than 1 meter (3.28 feet). In t~e study of curved
surfaces, & de Guiche found mmgin~ bands of disturbance of which
the sensibly uniform width scmcel exoeeded 20 centimeters (7.88
inches) on the two faces. It is we{ therefore, to use onl surfaces

which would be given by the wings of an mrphme of normal size. In
the case of very smsll models the mode of distribution of premre has
but a very remote relation to that which would be found on wings of
normal dmensions.
This condition of only using, for experimental purposes, models of
sufficient dimensions leads, in the method by the uee of an a@ificia3
current of air, to the emplopnent of very large.seotions for the cylinder of air. For =ainple, a study of@nes ha.yWeado@et=

The cylinder of air had a diameter of 1.5 meters (59.1 inchm).
The maximum velocity of this air was equal to 18 met+m (59 feet)

This increase in eilkiency is realized by interposing between the
experiment chamber and the fan a divergent oriihe forming a diffuser.
Tlus diiluser has a diamet~ equal to 2 meters at the outlet fim
the chamber; it connects with the ring of a helicoidd fan of 3.8
meters diameta (12.46 feet), providing for the flow of the air a
usefd motion of 9 square metere (96.9 square feet). The reduction
of velocity which is produced by ~assing through the Mfuser, as a
result of the progressive increase m diamet+r, raises the pressure of
the air by a certain uantity and d ‘hninishes oomspond~l
the
power wluch must be ? urnbhed to the fan m order ti bring tr e air
to atmospheric pressure.
The measure of the total resistance of the air is made in the experiment room by means of a balanoe, into the detail of which we can
not here enter.
The pressures exerted on each oint of the body subjected to the
action of the current of air are 1’eterm”medby means of oriiices of
very smalI diameter tied normdy to the surface at vmious poink
of the body and connected with manometers.

M. de Guiche has instituted a systamaticsserk of experiments by
the method of disphmin the body under investigation in cpiet air.
The body (use so far % as been made of plates in various forms) is
csarriedby an automobile. Two vertical pdlars fixed to the machine
carry at their upper extremities a horizontal axis on which are phwed
the mrious platw under investigation. These ~ates are provided
at their lated extremities with two graduated $ alf circles, Whi+l
by means of a needle carried b each pillar, serve to messure them
inclination relative to the line or movement. The pillars are of sufllcient he- ht and so placed that the turbulence reduced by the

M. de Guiche thus csrrka out a sort of topo a hical measure of
the ressures exerted on the different points oY% e plates both on

merits that this etlect is cdirely absent and that atmospheric prmsure prevails throughout the interior of the photo aphic chamber.
At the Iditute of SaintX&r, M. Maurain, who% as em loyed the
manmuetric method, uudertook to estabhsh in spite of t e pwtur%
bations caused by the movement of the vehicle, the atmospheric
prassure on the open art of the manometms which he uses for
measuring pressure. ? o this end the open part is connded
to a
space, completely tight, which communicattw with the outside air
by mesms of a tube placed at the extremity of an antenna. The
latter is placed uite far from the surface in order to maps variations
of ressure whiL are produced in its vicinity (2,3 meters, 7.54 feet)
in E ont of the surface under investigation and 3,35 meters (10.9 feet)
above the bod of the car. At the extremit of this antenna is a
%
tube of which t e usahd part is horizontal anJ cylindrical and is terminated by a pointed clcsed cone pointing in the direction of movement.
In the cylindrical tmd lateral part of the tube am formed
small circukr openings of 1 millimeter (0.04 inch) in diameter
which place it in communication with the atmosphere. M. Maurain
has amured himself that this tube plaaed in a current of air of zo
meters (65.6 feet) per second a proximately parallel to the current
assumes irubed the pressure of L e atmosphere.
The pressure thus de&mined directiy are reduced to. tho values
which the would have at a veIocity of 10 metars (32,8 feet) pcr
second. &r-v es of equal pressure may then be traced, thus indicating
the condition of the surface of the body and showing the distribution
of ressure over the same.
h rthermore, the surface of the body is divided into strips of a
cartain width. By a calculation of avarages, the mean prcsswe is
determined for each strip. Multiplying tlus by the surface of each
strip, we have the resistance exerted by the au on the iven stri .
h the s.tiace of t+ body under investigation is perfec $ y smoot E,
the fhqtion pf the am on such surface ma be ne lected. The force
determmed N then normaI to the surface o{5the bo y. By combining
these forces by the well-known methods of gra hical statics, the resiatance of the air over the entire plate maybe o$ tained in magnitude
and location.
Finally, in the experiments of M. de G@he the automobile should
move through a mass of air motionless as a whole, To this end the
experimen~ are made at certain hours on favorable days over a road
traversing a forest. The road is about 30 meters (98.4. feet) wide
and is bordered with sndl brush. The straight art in whidh the
measures are takm is determined at its two enL by easy turns.
There is thus avoided the establishment of a regular current of air
along the axis of the road.
The velocity of the automobile relative to the ground is measured,
correcting it, if necessary, for the component of the wind aIong the
direction of motion.

Graphic record is made of the magnitude of the components paralkl and perpendicular to the cable. When the system is in a state

The body under mwst~ation IS allowed to descend along the

The acceleration a is measured in the following manner: When a
pendulum is mopnted on a support which, itself, is given a movement
of translation vnth an accderated velotity, it tends to p~ace itself at
each instant in a position such that the angular deviation from the

PHYSICAL

Commandant Lafay has instaUed in the hysical laboratory of

the Polytechnic School the apparatus previous y used by M. Ratmm.
He has utilized this apparatus in order b solve, often m an elegant
manner, a series of interesting prQbhns in aerodynamics. For
example, he has prp osed to make visible the paths of air stream.lines
which surround SOII bodies of dif?erentforms laced within a cyhndcr
I
of air issuing from the discharge orifice of a ?an.
The methods which give the total resistance of tho air cnablo us
generally to determine separatdy the lift and the drift. From these
we ma then fmd the ratio of support, which is nothing but the ~atio

& . Lafay has set himse another problem”whioh is very importaut
in regard ta the practioe of aviation.
The experiments made with models of wings or of. airplanes am, as
a enersl rule, exchlsively static. The wind of the bkwmg ap~aratus
wf gse action is utilized IS maintained in a oonshnt state during the
pemod of each observation. Now, when an airplane moveg through
the air it is sub-sot on the ~art of the air to actions which vary qude
rapidly not o J y in intenm~, but also in direotion. Although the
inertia of an airplane prevents it from obe~
all th~ instantaneous
forcee,it maybe uestionedif the static expernuents of the laboratory
can be applied wi. out restriction to maoqee in practice. M. Lafay
lh
this question. He has
has striven to give a few indications regar
eriments, i. e., T
he as tried to study the
tried a few dynamic
Y
variable forces produced y a wind which changes rapidly its direotion
or its intensity.
entaI stud of this problem preswntsgreat difEcultiea
‘0$7
due cke y to the distur1“
mg aotions of inert&. In order to avoi~
t as possible, attached to
them, he was led to build mod& as
eleshc carriers, .md to make use of the Y eformatione of these carriers
in order to measure the forces. But if these deformations are to be
v
slight, in order th@ the energy aoguired by the system be n $&e,
they must, hcwever, be tic~tl~
great and sticien T~
regular to permit of arriving, by means o an appro riate optic
%
smpliflcation, at a oorreot evaluation of the forces w “ch roduoe
them. The redta of this amplMcation must be such that t%e can
be registered photogra hicaIIy on account of the rapidi~ of evo ?ution
in the phenomma un $er investigation. FinaUy, the model and its
elastic support would not fail to take on a vibrato
movement under
the action of the inevitable -ties
of the ? owing apparatus,
b
except for the pwoaution of adding lust enc h dampenmg to make
the apparatus praotiwdly aperiodic, without,T owever, retarding too
much lb dynamic indications.
M. Lafay has produoed an aerodpamometar capable of satidying
the9e ocmtradictmy conditions.
These experiments have been btampted by the war. However,
bm those which have been made it seemE to be proven that for
es of speed and direotion having the degree of rapidi~ of those

at a given moment has a v J!ue little difbrent (10 percent at the most)

But this construction may be transformed in the$ ollowing mmrwr:
In present practice with airphmw, normal conditions of operation
lead to the employment of propelle.mof a diameter of about 3 metma
(9.84 feet) turning at about 800 revolutions er minute. If, for
these conditions near the normal, the vectors ~ %~andB101 are zero,
the contour OA@l (?lB is reduced to the contour OAB. The construction reIative b normsl o

it is reduced to the tracing oF two lime instead of four. Now the
vectors AIB1 and B1Cl are zero, if the normal values (800 revolutions

TO
MACHINES
7
We have seen, Chapter II, that ex erimenters have studied the
problem of the resistance of the air eit% on reduced size models, or
er
on models nearly full sise or on actual full-size models. The mostcom lete and important results are those obtained by M. Eiflel on
mo z els.
One qua9tion presents itself immediately: Are all time experimental resulte comparable among themselves? TO what extent, for
actual airplanes, may we use the rasults of qeriments
carried outt
on a reduced scale?
Consider a body surrounded b the air and having a velocity of
translation V relative to it. If ~ is a suitably chosen surfnco, distinctive or characteristic of the form or design, the resistance of the
air may be expressed by the equation:
R= Z5’P . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (1)
K being a coefficient of the nature of a density.
We ma first note a law sufficiently exacti in a great number of
casea,lan~ which me fomulated in the seventeenth century by
Hu ghene Mariotte, and Pardies m fo~owe:
fl the density of the air remains the same (experiments carried
out in air at sensibly the same temperature and pressure), the
coe&ient K depends solely on the form of the body studied.
For simihw bodies, the coticient Kis constant, whatever maybe
the value of the velocity V. The realization of an experiment on a
reduced soalq similar to an ex eriment full size is easy. We may
for the
choose at wdl the scale of &e model and the docity
eriment.
e have assumed that the body is given a movement of translation
T
relative to the air; such a restriction LS
not essential. The movement
of the body@ the au ~y be more complex, accom anied, for exampie, b rotation; such IS the case of a screw props J’er. Jh an such
case, i owever, the eri heral velocities for the model and ?or the
full-sized machine sU’ d be in the same ratio as the velocities of
ou

ropeIIers, the speeds of advance are zero, and this

M. de Chiche hss found for certain surfaces, notably for planav

The latter has found, on the f@lowing face, only zones of prwsuro

Now the ex@ments
m the two casw~are very numerous and have

due ti phenomena which appear in one of the modes of experimentation and not in the other.
The principle of relative motion is, in fact, not in uestiom What
is in doubt is, whether, by the method of the tunneY conditions can

be developed which pernnt the assumption of equal relative motions
in the two case3.
Let us consider a solid which moves with a velocity Vin an indefiniti medium originally at rest. At a “ven moment, far from tho

the body under invea ation. One, formed of rc iom

latter. At each of these oints there is a velocity relative to the
movin body of — V, equ al, araUel and in the opposita direction to
the v 3 ocity of translatlon ; . The other region, situated near the
body, is disturbed by the movement of the latter. Relative to the
moving body, each point in this region has a velocity which is the
lwmdtant of
(a) A velocit —V equal, parallel, and opposite in direction to the
velocit of the %ody.
(b) K velocity W due to the motion of the solid body.
This last velocity is a function of the disturbance brought into the

bt us now assume the solid fked and the surrounding medium to
be displaced relative to it. Tbk mode of experimentation should
realize the conditions which re@rs the app%tion of the principle
of relative movement. For this It is nece

The viscosity of the-fluid may intermm in such manner as to cause

For angres of inclination comprised between Oand 10° rectangular

Beyond a-certain vaIue of the sprea,d there develops a regular
regnnen, mvolvmg the entye sqrface wnth the exception of two
lateral turbulent bands. Tlus regunen is imhcated by isobars parallcl
to the leading edge.
It appeam that the fairly uniform width of the bands of turbulence
does not exceed 20 centimeter (7.9 inchm). It is desirable, therefore, to use no aerofoils with a spread less than 40 centimeters (15.8
inches).
(2) Each one of the faces of the aerofoils joins in the support, but
not equalIy. The pressures supported by the lower face, at ordinary
incidence of flight, aw.une a smaller share of the total force than the
n ative presume on the back.
Y 3) The lower face is subject to the iniluence of the upper face, but
is itself without influence on the latter.
(4) The curvature of the back determines the distribution of the
ne ative pressures; it deviates upward the lines of air ffOW.
%n exaggerated height of the arc for the curvature on the back
produces a harmful taunter pressure on the folIowing edge of the
win.
T%e &@acement of the maximum height of arc toward the lead”
edge carries a corresponding displacement of the maximum value? o
the negative preamre, and in consequence a reduction in the drift
value.
The ideal would be to suppress in an aerofoil harmful pressures,
positive or negative (that is to say, to have on the upper face only
negative ressureaand on the lower face onl positive ressures), and
to find t%e prwsure of the atmosphere or&at the &lowing edge

(1) The total resultant force continuously increases with tho angle
of incidence, at least within the range of interest in aviation.
Aa to the force center (intemection of the total resultant with
the chord of the section) .it approaches nearer and nearer to the
leading edge as the angle of incidence increases from zero, at Icast

(2) If aerofoils of varying thickness have the same surface of mean
curvature, they are the more advantageous as the thickness is less.
M. Eiffel has shown, in effect, that under these conditions the ratio

If, m the plane of symmetry the leading e e of the following

M. Eiflel has made a series of experiments with two lanes of the
same type, of. which one has an aspect ratio of 6 (9o \ y 15 centimetms (354 by 5.9 inches)) and the other of 3 (45 by 15 centinmtem
(17.8 b% 5.9 umhes)).
The duck” type has been studied (yertical displacement zero)
from 2° to 6° and scpawith valuea of the angle of d6caIage v
rations of the planes equal to 4/3 andY’
8/3 t em width.
The “ ordinaxy mono lane” type has been studied with a d6caIage
of 4° and se arations of the elements identical wit$ the preceding.
FinaUy, d . Eiflel has studied the tandem type wth equal elements.
The angle of incidence of this combination of elements is the angle
relative to the chord of the leading element.
(1) “Duok” type.
From the vie~oint of suetentation and of head resistance, it is
advantageous JO increase the separation of the elements, and not to
exceed a certain angle of dticalage.
Suppose tha~ for various angles of -incidence, there have been
determined the total resultant of the am forces on the combination
of elements. We shall denota the aggregate of these by the term
“bundle of resultants.”
In the study of this bundle, the foil” “- results are obtained:
Y
(a) The bundle is always located toward t e middle of the interval
which se aratw the two elements. It is then in this re ‘on that the
center o? gravity of an airplane of this type should be ?ound.
(5) For a given distance between the elements, the bundle is so
much the more extended as the d6calage is greater.
(c For a given d6cal e, the bundle is so much the more extended
as d e distance between% e elements is eater.
This longitudinal change in the bund ?e of resdttante has relation
with the longitudinal stabdity of an airplane of this type.
(d) For a “ven distance between the elements! the bundle of
resultants is f ~placed toward the forward element m proportion as
the d6calage is increased.
In an an-plane of the “duck” t e, if the dhhige is increased
it is necesmry to move the center oP gravity forward.
Let us suppose that in such an airplane the center of gravity is on
the pro~ller shaft. For e tiibrium under a certain angle of incidence, It is necessary that 5 e rmdtant corresponding to this angle
t
pass through the center of gravity. Fko.rn@, .Igt ~ drop normals

reduotion of the snstentation and by an increase m the head raustence in relation to the sustentation and to the head resistance of the

The reIative diminution of the snsteutation is independent of the

When the motive power is zero, the tractio~is negative and the prop.~er functions like a windmiIL It absorbs power furnished by the

The measurement were made in a plane situated either in front or

(1) There is acceleration in the milocity of the curreut of air,
whether in front of or behind the repeller.
(2) The acceleration is greater %ehmd than in front.
(3) Acceleration increases from the hub outward to a distance
from the asis betweau 1/3 and 2/5 the diameter; it then decrmacs
as the ti of the blade is approached.
This d!mreaseie more rapid behind than in front.
(4) The value of the maximum of the acceleration depends on the
direction of the relative velocity
at the tip of the blade. Let ~~

seerm to be an upper limit. It leads ta rotative speeds of the model

When the roblem is concerned with the study of the propellers
of a dirigible rdiameter 4.5 meters (14.75 feet)), the ratio requires the
use of modeIs of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in diameter. These models
seem a ~ttle large for the cylinder of sir 2 meters (6.56 feet) in diameter employed at Auteuil by M. Eiffel. In this case it would be preferable to employ a model on the scale of 1/4 (diameti, 1.125meters (3.69
feet) , turning at 2,000 revolutions per minute, correspond@ to 600
revo tutions per minute for the propellers of the dirigible.

If we-call Wthe velocity of the current of air and if we consider the

the influence on the traction and on the power absorbed

seemed to depend on this ratio.

then more and-more’ ;lowly.

to the calcu-

lation of M. Maurain, director of the I&titute of Saint-@r, it is seen
that the traction of this helicopter would be increased by about 1/3 of
its value as a remdt of the relative current of air due to the movement
of the airplane; but the power to be supplied wouId itdf be increased
by about 1/4.
It would be interesting to apply such conclusions to the results of
experiments on propciUemhuger than those studied by M. RiabouchlnsIqy.

‘lb
ems ago there was only one laboratory in France in which
researcI - on the resistance of air were carried on in a systematic
manner. This was the laboratory imtdled at Cl&ia-hfeudon by
CCLCharles Renard. An engineer of great talent and, at the same
time, a remarkable schohm, our fellow countryman must be considerimentaI aerodynuaics.

T ther expenmentars had, to be sure, undertaken at this very time
interesting researches upon the resistance of the air. We may cite

F arallel with the studies of M. EiffeI on mod%, the Aerotechnic
Institute of Sain~,
under the ener etic direction of its director,
M. M.auram, and of lts subdirector, $ Toussaint, makes use of ita
elaborate e uipment to study avions & parts of avions in normal
size. This ~aboratory, at we present moment the most important
?sal of inventors numerous pmcw of
in the world, puts at the
a paratus for me asurementaw
%
enable them to determine a priori
e
t% ualities of the machines which they have under design. In
colla%oration with military atiation pilots, M. Touasaint has been
able to instalI on the avions ingenious registering devicm which make
it ossible to determine, during a flight, the affects of the air on the
J “ erent parts and the pilot’s maneuvers.
This ensemble of researches, executed by the difhrent l?lench
laboratories, researches which cumplemmt each oth~, have already
led to the series of results of which we have given an Idea in Chapter
IV of this re~rt,
These experimental results derive their importance from & fact, viz that they have been obtained by means of
a la e number of car& experiment susceptible of giving them a
high~egree of reliability.
Aviation has, moreove?, derived a great benefit-from these ltiboratoqy ex eriment9. I will cito here onl one comlrmatory example.
In spite o$ certain ideas put-forward by 5 . Rateau in regard to screw
pro ellers, the cons@ctom of airplanes made little of the influence
of ~ e back of the wings on the vsJue of the supporting force; they
%
baheved that the whole effect came from the w preesurc upon the
faoe directly exposed to the wind. But certain resmrchw tied
out at the laboratory of M, Eiffel on the distribution of air eflccts on
the two surfaces of an aerofod showed that there ‘were negative pressures on the back and that thee were much more important than
the pressureson the surface directly ex~oscd to the wind. Whrefore,
contrary to the mode of construction m practice, the necessity arose

N3R.ONAUTICIS.

of fixing edidly the oanvas on the back of the wing in order to avoid
..
accident.

The stud-y of the conditions of flight for airplanes by means of
registering instruments standardized m the laboratories hss, as hf.
Toussaint has showm, a great importance from the point of view of
scdety. It is of rime importance to put within the hands ofpilots
%
instruments ca a Ie of controRing the qpality of their evolutions.
Thisisofspe cm! im~rtan~ for the pupil; it is no less so for the expe
“
rienced pilot. Stat@ics, m fact, show that a goodI number of accidents are to be imputed to mistakes in piioting. z uch false maneuvers are often unconscious md wult from the ignorance of the pilot
as to the Limitsof safe~ m which he can maneuver his avion. By
mems of appropriate instrummts these limits can be determined
for each type of machine and even for each machine on the aviation
fiekis by experienced pilob. The file of the aerodynamic laboratories is to combine such registering a pwatus so as b simplify the
installation on board the machines an$ to stmdardize these instruments. The bstitute of i3ain&Cvr has ccmunenced to do this work
.
with success.
Our aerodynamic laboratory are concerned ~,
not onIy with
the solving of probkme which are a part of &e emenca of aerodynamics but they strive also to come to the assistance of our constructors, and they have their share in the evolution of a weapon
which is just now rendering such pat services in the war where the
destiny of the country which saw lb birth is at stake.
