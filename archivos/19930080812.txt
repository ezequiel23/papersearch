-4General Pr5ncinles.

The five years of War have brought abont a remarkable develepent Of
aviation in all its different departments. Let us hasten to add that we
cannot have a very clear idea of all the progress ao&mplh&d
until after o’urreturn to noszd peaoe conditions, the manufacturers oflthe tWO
enemy csmps having na>ursdly hMden the~r designs fran eaoh other~ Within
the very near future, the rivals on both sides wgll learn what their
reoent enemies have been doing.
Meanwhile, whatever may be the general opinion, there is no probl=
more urgezxtthan that.of oeourity. Yhe caplete statiatios of aooidents

Also, the steadily increasing speed of flight renders .

a
and more tioklish thing to effect, especially on a strange ground. The
obvious conclusion is that we must enooursge all irmestigat%one having for
their object the minimizing of landing cliffoulties, and of the distance
i
to be travereed before stopping.
The new Michelin prize ie the outccme of this movement, aud the solution of the problem is hoped for 3U the helicopter type fiohiae.
Considering only the airplane - the ourrent solaltioa present at
we can understand the advsatage of flying at high speed; but, at the same
time, a very low landing speed is necessary fo= seourityls salm. =om
these two requirements has arisen the Speed Ratio Competition, the Rules
of whioh have just been given.
These introductory reruu’kewere necesssxy, bat we must not forget
that the idea of su& a test dates baok ten years, and that its author
waa the Marquis de Dion, who thus gave aaother proof of his practioal
common sense. wan the time of the fizst landing aooidemts - and Heaven
knows how painful they were - M. de Dion was impressed with the necessity
of reducing landing speeds. This (kmpetition Shauld, therefore, be placed
