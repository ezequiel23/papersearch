ANNUAL

COMMITTEE

FOR AERONAUTICS.

INTRODUC1’ION.
The dhiency of a radiator for airplane engines depends primarily upon two factors:
(I) Its capacity for dissipating heat and (2) its absorpfiop.~f engine power be~ause of the .gecessity of pushing it through the air (overcoming its head.rewstance) and of lifting and sustaining
its weight.
At high altitudes both the density and the temperature of the air are less than at the
ground, and the change in these conditions has an important effect upon the performance of
the radiator. The decrease in air temperature ,tinds to increase the cooling capacity, while
the decrease in density of the air tends to decrease both the coding capacity and the absorption of power for any given speed of the airplane. On the other hand, the power of the sngine,
and consequently the heat to be dissipated, falls off .svithaltitude, so that at high altitudes a
given engine may be kept cool by a smaller ratliator than that required for the same conditions
of speed ‘md climb nem the ground.
PURPOSE.

The purpose of this report is, by showing the effect of temperature and density of the air
on dissipation of heat and absorption of power, and with the use of available data on atmospheric conditions at altitudes, to present a method for. estimating the performanm. of +
radiator under altitude conditions in terms of ita performance at the ground. A brief discti
sion will also be given of the relative cooling capacity required at altitudes and at the ground.
Since atmospheric conditions are continually changing, it will be evident that any estimate
of performance at an altitude must be based upon assumed conditions, such, for example, as
mean summer density and temperature of air, in addition to assumed requirementsof oparation,
such.= the maximum allowable water temperature. Certain meteorological data have accordy
ingly been included, in order to give such basis ~s ~-available for the assumptions that must
be made.

The results of tests at the ground are expressed as follows:
Free air speed (the speed of the airplane),.in miles per hour.
Mizssjhu.r of air through the radiator, in pounds per second por square foot frontal area.
Energy dwsipated (heat transfer), in horsepowty per square foot of frontal area per 100° F.
diflerenc~ between the temperature of the ent&ing afi and the average of the tcmporaturos of
the entering and leaving water, at ground. (At an altitude this timp~rature differmwc may
be modified.)

in overcoming head rwistance and that used in sustahing and lifting the weight of the radia@r
and contained water, msnming for the airplane a lift-drift ratio of 5.4.
Fi~re of merit is defined as the ratio of the energy dissipated to the horsepower absorbed.

The method of estimating radiator perfo~ance. under altitude conditions is has@ upon
the following laws:
1. Mass flow of air, for a given speed of the airplage, is proportional to the air density.
2. Energj dissipated (rate of heat transfer), for a given mass flow of air, is independent
of air density. This fact is shown by a series of tests “conducted on a number of specimens in a
wind tunnel which was entirely inolosed in a steel tank so that the air could be partially exhausted. The range of air densities used corresponds to altitudw up to about 25,000 feet.
Plot No. 10 shows the resulte of these tests.’
3. Energy dissipated for a given mass flow of a$ ‘~ay be regarded as proportional to tho
t.omperature difference indicated under “Detitiori& ‘of terms.” Several investigators have

proposed empirkyd equations for the rate df heat transfer, in which the temperature diflerbnce
occurred to a power slightly diflerent from unity (in some cases as high as 1.2), but if the greatest
value found were to be used, the difference bstween the result so obtained and that obtained
using unity for the exponent, would be well within the range of uncertainty in atmospheric
conditions at high altitudes. For the pr~ent purpose, tlpmfore, the linear proportionality
will be used.
4. Head resistance, for a given free air speed, is proportional to the density of the air.
This fact is in general use by aerodynamic engineers, and while it has been verified by a part
of the experimental work on which this report is based, it hardly requires to be proved h~e.
In ord?r to give some idea of the atmospheric conditions that may be expected at altitudes,
plots Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are included, These plots are based on data given by W. R. @egg in
the Monthly Weather Retiew, January, 1918. Plots 1 and 2 indicate mean summer, winter,
and annual values of temperature and air density based upon observations at four stations
situated in Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and California. Plot No. 3 showa the boiling
point of water corresponding to mean annual pressure at the saqp stations, only one line being
plotted because the difference between annual and summer or winter means (1.5°,at 25,000
feet, and I- at lower altitudes) is so small that it may safely be neglec@dj in view of the
uncertainties in all altitude conditions.
In order to inake use of the data on atmospheric conditions, and in particular of the proportionalities mentioned above, it will be convenient to introduce the terms “density factor”
and t{temperature factor,” and to debe them M follows:
Density factor=
and
Temperature factor=

temperature dillerence existing at altitude.
temperature difference assumed at ground

It will be noted that density and temperature ~erence “at ground” denote the assumed
density and temperature dii%rence to which the redts of tests at ground,,have been reduced,
and that the (‘factors” are not constants, but vary with altitude and with atmospheric conditions.
Then the actual values of density and temperature facto~ to be used in any particular
computation will depend upon more or Iws arbitrary assumptions in regard to atmospheric
conditions, and these assumptions will depend Upori the conditions waler which it is deairad
to study the performan~ of the rad.iatir-whether for summer or winter flying, wheth6r for
mean or extreme conchtlons, etc. The temperature factor will also depaid upon the limit set
for maximum allowable water temperature.
It is now possible to express the properties of a radiator at an altitude in terms of its
propeitiw at t~e ground, and the density and temperature facturs, as follows:
1. For a given free air speed, mass flow of air, being proportional to air density, is equal
to the product of the mass flow it the ground by the density factor.
2. Energy dissipated per lUUO1? temperature difference an altitude is the same as that
dissipated per 100° F. at the ground jii the same mueg$ow of air.
3. Energy actually dissipated at an altitude, btig proportional ta tie temperature. difference, is equal to the product of the mergy disipatid per 100° F. by tie t-perature factor.
4. For a given free air speed, head resistance, being proportional to air density, is equal
to the product of the head resistance at the ground by the density factor.
METHODOF COMPUTATION.
The method of computing the performance .at an altitude m?y be summarized as follows:
1. Choose an altitude and a free air speed.
2. Aeaume such conditions SE will de-e

DESCRIPTION CURVES..
OF
Plots Nos. 4 to 7 represent the properties of two types of radiator core at altitudes; plots
NOS.4 and 6, showing figure of merit, and plots Nos. 5 and 7, energy dissipated, in terms of
altitude. The conditions and requirements assumed are mean summer dem+ity and temperature of air and a mean water temperature 30° F. below the boiling point. The computations
are based upon data given in plots Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
Radiator 1%8 is made of flat hollow plates set edgetie to the air stream, and its performance is typical of radiatom adapted to use inunobstructed positions-that is, in such positions
on the plane that the flow of air toward or away from the radiator is not obstructed by other
parts of the plane.
Radiator G-3 is a type of high heat transfer and high head resistance, adapted to use only
in obstructed positions. Its properties are comput~d, however, only for the condition of
being placed in an unobstructed position, since the problem of determining head rw.istance in
an obstructed position is too complex to be introduced into this report. (See Reports No.
59, Genetal Anal@s of the Radiator Problem, and 61, Part II, Resistance Due to Nose
Radiator.)
The curves indicate that while heat transfer falls off with altitude, the iigure of merit may
increase slightly at the higher speeds. The general form of the curves is the same for both the
type of core suitable for unobstructed positions and the type suitable for obstructed positions.
Plot No, 8, based on mean summer density, shows a typical relation of “density factor”
to altitude; and since head resistance is proportional to density, this plot also shows the relation
of head resistance at a given free air speed to altitude. No curve of “temperature factor” is
shown, because so many different assumptions may be made in regard to atmospheric conditions and operating requirements that a single curve could hardly be called typical. “Temperature factor” cam easily be computed for various assumptions from data given in the plots of
temperature and boiling point against altitude.

.—

the radiator is to be partly masked at the higher altitudes, plot No. 9 may be wed to
give an approximate idea of the degree of roasting desirable, in terms of the cooling capacity
required at the ground for horizontaljlight.
Let a radiator be chosen of such a size that it will just cool the engine when flying at a given
speed (shy, 120 malesper hour) horizontally, and close t.athe ground. Now the energy required
to be dissipated, divided by the energy that the radiator is capable of dissipating, will represent
what may be termed the t‘ effective area” of radiator required at an altitude, in square feet per
square foot required at the ground. ‘I’be adjective (‘effective” is used because the decrease
in heat transfer caused by a partial masldng will depend not only upon the area of face covered,
but upon the form of shutter used. The real indication of heat transfer will be given by the
mass flow of air, rather than by area.
The power of the engine, and consequ&tly the heat to be dissipated, may be assumed
rou@y proportional to the air density (see Report No. 45, Part I), and an approximate value
may be found by multiplying the energy dissipated at ground by the density factor. Plot
No. 9 shows the ratio of this required dissipation to the capacity for dissipation, as taken from
plots Nos. 5 and 7, and represents approximately the ratio of the “effective area” desirable at
an altitude to that required at the ground, M the.rad.iatir is to keep the engine at a constant
temperature, These curves are plotted for a speed of 120 miles per hour, but are practically
identical with the curves for other speeds. This fact, and the small difference between the
two curves plottad, seems ti indicate that the destiable degree of masking is a function of the
altitude, and practically independent of the type of core or of the speed.

“

When the plane changes from maximum olimb to horizontal flight, its speed will be greatly
increased (for some types of planm, about doubled), and this inorease in speed will involve a
proportional increase in maw flow of air, and a corresponding (though not proportional) increase
in heat transfer. This consideration alone would require a degree of masking that would in
some cases approach 50 per cent of the eff.ectivenees of the radiator at the altitude, but it has
not been included in the computations for plot No. 9 because of a wide range of its variation
with di.fTerent
planes and their different uses. If the relation is known between the maximum
climbing speed and the horizontal speed when using the same engine power, then the mass
flow of air and the corresponding heat transfer dan be determined from the resulti of tests at
the ground, and the degree of masking that is desirable cm be found from the two rates of
heat transfer.
It may be well to note that no account has been taken of additional cooling from the
surface of the engine itself or from connecting pipes, caused by the Iowering of the air temperature; and again let it be emphasized that mass flow of air gives the real measure of what has
been tamed “effective area.”
