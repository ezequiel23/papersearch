GENTLEMEN: The particular work comprising the subject of this.	
:	
report	 has been	 undertaken pursuant	 to	 an allotment	 by Dr. Charles
.•.•.
D. Walcott, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, of $2,500, made
available through the Secretary of Agriculture to the Chief of the 	
.
Weather Bureau.	 At the meeting of the executive committee held
.:	
June 11, 1915, the chairman, Dr. Charles D. Walcott, was authorized to. 	 •	
designate Charles F. Marvin, Chief of the Weather Bureau, as chairman	 .	
.
of a subcommittee to investigate and report upon the problem of the
atmosphere in relation to aeronautics. 	 He was requested to select .	
.
other members of the subcommittee, not to exceed four, and Prof.
William J. Humphreys and William R. Blair, of the-United States 	
.	
Weather Bureau, subsequently consented to act as members of the	
•
.	
subcommittee.	
.	
... .•	
At the meeting of the executive committee held August 5 1915, a	
. .	
.
proposal of work to be undertaken was outlined by the chairman of 	
..
the subcommittee on the atmosphere in relation to aeronautics, the
substance of which is briefly quoted as follows

The Weather Bureau is alread y in possession of an immense amount of data concern. 	 .	
•
ing atmospheric conditions, including wind movements at the earth's surface. 	 This	 .	
•	
.	 .
information is no doubt of distinct value to aeronautical operations, but it needs to 	
.	
.'
be collated and put in form to meet the requirements of aviation.	 The bureau also
has a considerable amount of determinations of atmospheric conditions in the free air. 	
••
Most of these observations were made at Mount Weather, but others have been made at
•	
a few points in the West, such as Huron, S. Dak.; Fort Omaha, Nebr.; Avalon, Cal.; 	
.•	 .
and a few aboard the Coast Guard cutter Seneca, during the past summer while this	
.
vessel was engaged on	 ice	 patrol off	 the Newfoundland	 coast.	 Portions	 of these
data also are undoubtedly valuable to aviation, but it is quite apparent that but a	
•
small fraction of the material needed to meet the requirements of aeronautical work
.	 .
.
throughout the United States is available, and that therefore much additional obser.	
.	
vation work is necessaay.	
.
In considering the work that should be done along these lines, further cooperation 	
.	
.
.	 is needed by the Weather Bureau with those actually engaged in aeronautical opera- 	
..
tions, and with this need in view Prof. Blair, a member of the subcommittee, has
.,
already been in conference with Mr. F. H. McCrary, acting director of naval aero-	
.
,nautics.	 Itis proposed to utilize the fund made available by the Smithsonian Institution to undertake a careful compilation of the data already available in the Weather 	
.	
.•
Bureau records, this compilation to be along lines that will make the data available	 .	
.
to aviation; also that additional observations be undertaken to gain information con- 	
.	
.
.	 cerning atmospheric conditions by means of pilotto
balloons, the position and motions 	
of which are recorded by theodolites and such other apparatus as the work may require.
It may be proper to state at this point that the Weather Bureau is already conducting
•	
aerial investigations of direct interest to meteorology and that the new work herein
proposed will be supplementary and in addition the work the Weather Bureau is

• already performing. Embarrassment has been experienced in the progress of this work' /(
since the European war on account of the inability to procure serviceable rubber
balloons. A manufacturer in Ohio has undertaken to supply these, and has submitted
a considerable number of samples and full-sized balloons, ho far, however, the resilta/
have been almost a complete failure, on account of the seeming inability to seture
the necessary strength and gas tightness at the seams. Work is still 	 progress, howin
ever, on the manufacture of the balloons, and we are hopeful of more favorable
results in the future.

ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS IN RELATION TO AERON. TJTICS

1 INTRODUCTION —Brief presentation of a few fundamental
principles and data relating togeneral atmospheric conditions and . 	
•	
.• . •	
motions and forming a basis for the subsequent discussion of relations 	
-	
of temperature pressure and motions of the atmosphere
.

:.	
..	
CHAPTER 1.—General meteorological and . climatological data	
• - •.	
..	
selected and classified with respect to its bearing on aeronautics. 	
• ., The data should show general surface conditions of weather, tern- 	
•	
.	
perature, sunshine, rain, thunderstorms, humidity, and wind velocity. . 	
and directions; also comprise as full information concerning average .
free-air conditions as the scanty data available permit.	
.	
CHAPTER II.—A discussion of particular and local atmospheric. . 	
conditions as affecting aviation.	
.	
CHAPTER III.--General presentation of free-air conditions ar•	
ranged with relation to surface conditions
L	
CHAPTER IV.—Instruments with snecial reference to aviation. 	
CHAPTER V.—Miscellaneous useful material not otherwise in- .
cluded.	
APPENDIX.—Formujes and practical tables. 	
.	
The practical closing of European markets for certain instrumental
supplies has prevented procuring recording theodolites of special
construction needed in studying atmospheric motions by means of
:-	
•
pilot and sounding balloons.	 A type of instrument of this kind has 	
been designed and efforts are being made to secure the manufacture
'in the United States of a small supply for the Weather Bureau work. 	
Difficulties are still encountered in 	 procuring	 in the United States	
•	
a gocd quality of rubber balloons for atmosphe'ric explorations. 	
Mention is made at this	 point	 of a special form of camera adapted
• •'
to make a photograph on a single plate of the entire sky from horizon
to zenith.	 This ha been developed and tried out by Mr. Fred W.
Mueller, with the advice and assistance of Dr. 0. L. Fassig, both of
Baltimore, Md.	 The instrument is fully described and illustrated in
the Monthly Weather Review.
Since the publication of that paper I am: informed by Dr. Fassig
that Mr. Mueller has greatly improved the mechanical arrangements
of the camera, so that the same results can be obtained in a simpler . 	
manner.	 It is believed the device may have some special use in
aeronautics as well as meteorology.
