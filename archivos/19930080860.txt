the Eifiel tunnel (which begins

at the entrance cone and terminates behind the

because

there must be an airtight room for the experimenter on account
of the partial

vacuu~

the return current and are therefore able to make the testing
room perfectly accessible"

We can enter the testing room with

the crane and we can run the testing apparatus (which is provided
with wheels) in on tracks.

The location of the tracks is shown

In order to obtain more room for the apparatus, two

bays were built, one on either side of the

If, after

an aeroioil experiment" a propeller test is to oe made, the latter can be prepared in one of the bays and then

This is one great advantage of this plant .

Another advantage consists in the smoothness and uniformity of
the air current resulting from the series of curved streamlined
deflectors in each corner.
Still cillother advantage lies in the fac t that the width of
the

cl~oss-section

behind the blast gradually increases and is

then greatly reduced sl-;,ortly belore the measu.ring place .

Thus we

This increases the spe ed

fivefcld and the momentc.un twenty-fivefold, from which it follov;s
that the irregularities ensuing from the inflow only re.La ue -co
'~

values of 1/25 of the momentum previously obtaining.

.

..i..

Thus, with-

out spe cial adjustment.) uniformi ty is assured in the experim:::mtal cross-section to within 4% of the momentum, and
speed.

Since the

lL~iformity

z%

of the

in the inflowing current is fairly

good to start with, it is very satisfactory in the experimental
section.

In contrast with the forner plant, where we could ob-

tain uniformity only through tedious adjustments whi ch, in the
course of time often had to be repeeted, we here obtained a satisfactorily uniform current at the very

ou~set.

A great saving of power is effected by th e arrangement in
the new plant.

In the old tunnel.) Kith its uniform cross-section,

there was a great loss of energy in eliminating the eddies.

~e

have therefore put the straightening device, a honeycomb with
cells of

o~ly

about an inch diameter, in the position of least

velocity, thereby causing only a small loss of energy.

The ener-

gy emerging from the entrance cone, aside from the losses in the
open

stretch, is utilized in the further circulation, since the

whole stream is again collected.

In this way the kinetic

ener ~j

of the air stream in the exp erimental section is nearly 1 1/2
times the energy of the blast et the driving shaft of the blower.
This is made possible by the fact that the kinet ic- energy is par-

- 7 -

tially recovered in the collector.

Hence only about 2/3 of t~G

air energy needs to be furnished at the blower shaft.
In Gbttingen we have an alternating current which rencier8

Oonsequently, we J:'I c_ '3
"T

i:rJ.stalled a motor-generator set (consisting of an inducG'tol1 mo-'
tor

-r;rhicn drives a dynamo) by which the blower motor is dl.'ive:l.

The power plant also includes a smaller dynamo for dI'ivln g the
propeller-testing device and an exciting dynamo.
Both dynamos are s o-called Ward-Leonard dynamos which can be
run at different voltages, so that the blower may be dri-ven at
any desired speed from 50 to 1100 r.p.m.

In this connection,

there is a regulation system, consisting of a coarse and a fine
l'egulator, which influences the field excitation of the dynai11os.
The fine regulator is operated automatically by a pressu=e balance or regulator.
Fig. 3 is a diagram of the pressure regulator.

It is quite

complicated, and I will not try to explain all its details h ere .
The essential points are as follows: The excess pressure in the

sealing liquid.

The diagram shows how the pressure ma kes the

level of the liquid lower inside than outside the movable cylinder, thereby exerting an upward force corresp onding to this difference in level, against the horizontal balance arm

The maximum power at the blower shaft is about 300 HP .

On a

car which can run horizontally on the wooden rails, there is a
tower on which a second car runs in a vertical direction.
Through the latter run s a rod on the end of which is a pressure
gage.

Thus all points can be reached.

By means of a pressure

recording device, a line is drawn for either the horizontal or
vertical direction.
Fig. 5 shows a device that is located under the floor of
the experiment room.

(In Fig. 4 this space is left empty, cor-

responding to its condition at the beginning of 1917.)

This is

very noteworthy object, consisting of a turntable with floats

and a trap.

When

t~e

experimental apparatus is

whe8~ed

in , it

can 3:lot be left on wheels J but must l'est on sta tiOTIdry su:p::- orts,
since only thus can accurate weighings be r:!ade .

Hence it is nec-

essary to have some 8pecial provision for sUP1Jort ing the heavy
a};:paratus wr"ic:l 'Weighs from 500 to 1500 kg.

We have hit upon

the exp eiient of lowering the central po=tion of the track on
four spind:':"es.

that .. for ex-

ample, a p:Lopeller can be tested in an oblique position with r<:3f-

erence to the air current.)
In addition to the fact that it can turn on a circular track
a,

the device has the fLuther peculiarity that a part of it can

float.

of which there are four.

When water is poured into these pots" the so-called float frarJe
c

is supported by the floats.

By pouring water into the pets,

a lift of 0 to 2000 kg. may be generated, so that the heaviest
objects can be floated.

The

p~rpose

of the floats is to enable

a horizontal motion in all directions, so that when we attach one
or more scales to the o·oject, we can li·!easv.:re the forces without
trouble from frj, ction.

Thus :far provision has only been r.:ade for measure-

ments of drag, but it is intended to provide also for lift measurements.

'.

Fig. 6 is a diagram of the measuring device, the so-called
3-component balance , which has been chiefly used for measuring
lift, drag and moment.

It has been built on the plan of the very

satisfactory device employed in the old plant, with some structural

improveme~ts,

and also for greater forces.

The aerofoils are

usually hung bottom up, so that the lift stresses the wires instead of slackening them.

In the contrary case, it may happen

that the model, when it is not sufficiently weighted, is lifted

- 1.3 -

and the wires are broEen.
nothing can happen .

By the above-indicated method, however.

linen the model is not heavy enough to wi th-

stand a negative lift, a

fe~

additional weights are hung on

sp~n

wires.

The new tunnel is designed for an air speed of 54 m/sec. and
it will probably be possible to reach 60 m/sec., corresponding to
all air efficienoy of about 800 HP.

this would result from the great difference in lift) if a float
went down on one side while tne opposite float went up.
In this connection) Dr. Prandtl claims that the

o8~tBr

of

gravity of the floating portion of the propeller testing device
is quite elevated and that, by suitable water filling, the l ateral
metacenter may be brought as near as desired to the center of gra1Jity.

For this purpos.e, ·the side floats · are of oomparatively small

cross-section in the vertical direction.

Hence, the fears of

Prof . Parseval can be dis=egarded.
Engineer Gsell sugg:3sted that possibly the Eiffel tunnel
might be '!lore favorable in its powe::? consun:pt5.on than. the Gottingen tunnel and that the loss of power at the exit of the former
might be smaller than in the 7etur~1 curre!~t of the Gottingen tunnel; also that, in the Gottingen arrangenent, power might be , further conserved by gradual:y increasing the

c~oss - section

the expel'iment place into a -:idiffuserll before the beginning of the

Prof. Prandtl answerGd that i n fact the Eiffel tunnel appears
to oe from 5 to 10% more economical than the Ggttingen tunnel.
