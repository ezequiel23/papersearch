Lead, tin and zinc which, as is well known, have an unfavor-

able influence upon the pennanence of aluminum' alloys, are not found
in duralUlllin.
The specific gravity of duralumin varies according to composition and hardness from 2.75 to 2.84.

The melting point is about

6500 C.
Duralumin is made under this name by the Durener Me tal 1war ke ,
Duren (Rhld), and under the name of Bergmetall by Carl Berg, Eveking
(West!. ).

Working of Duralvmin
Like other metals, dural'Umin can be rolled

in~o

plates and

shapes and behaves in a similar manner, in that the elongation decreases as the hardness of rolling increases.

Tube blanks, however,

- 2 can be made only by pressing and not by the oblique rolling method.
Fig. 1 shows the increase in tensile strength and decrease
in elongation of a duralumin plate as its thickness is reduced by cold
rolling from 7 mm. to 2 mm.

The strength increases from 41 kg. to

about 54 kg. per sq.mm. while the elongation falls from 22.7 to 2.3 percent.

The curve shows that the elongation decreases very rapidly with

the very first reduction in thickness.
However, duralumin can be worked hot at a temperature of
about 4000 C. very well.
Tempering
I

Dutalumin can be tempered, like steel, by heating and sudden
cooling.

For this purpose plates, tubes, and shapes are heated to be-

tween 4800 and 5100 and quenched, then aged; that is, the treated
material is s~ply set aside.

~he original strength characteristics

are very nearly restored atter the quenching but the tensile strength
continues to grow with the time of ageing, from 35 to 50 kgs. per
sq.mm.

The elongation does not decrease but remains at least the same

and usually incre~ses slightly.

In practice the greatest strength is

reaChed after about 5 days of ageing.
When heated to over 5300 C. duralumin becomes unusable.

Con-

sequently the treating is carried on in a bath of nitrates whose temperature can be carefully regulated and watched.

During the ageing of

the metal work cannot be done on it which would change the section
as in that case the strength will not increase any more.

After the

completion of ageing, the material can be re-rolled in order to obtain
smooth surfaces.

The strength is thereby increased at the expense of

The modulus of elasticity of the hard composition 6ala was
found by the Techniachen Bochschule .Aachen to be 700,000 kgs. per sq.. em.

Making allowance for the possible effect of vibration on the modulus of
elasticity it appears better to use not more than 650,000 kgs. per

s~.

em. in computations.
In j'lldging as to the suita.bility of a ma.terial for use in

stressed parts not only the tensile strength but also the ductility is
of great

~portance.

This can be determined by bending strips baCk-

.Although the strength values of the steel plates are less than
those of the duralumin plates, nevertheless one can compare the figures
as to number of bends and depths of impression without correction, since
it is possible to obtain steel plata with higher strength which also
possesses great ductility .
The number of bends (see Fig. 5) for both metals decreases
with increased thickness.

For steel, however, they lie considerably

The difference is least for plates under

For thicker plates of dural'umin the number of

bends decreases very rapidly.

A plate 2 rom. thick breaks over a 90

bend; a plate 4 rom. thick over a 450 bend.

From these results dura-

lUlIlin might be referred to as "cold short" for thicknesses greater than
1 mm.

This property makes it uns~itable for highly stressed parts

which must at the same time withstand vibrations.

This is of pr~e im-

portance in connection with the bent lug plates which are ordinarily
used in aircraft for taking wire terminals;

In these lugs vibrations

undoubtedly occur dux ing flight which \"lould reduce the strength of the
dural'\llllin and might cause sudden fracture.
Exactly how vibrations influence the modulus of elasticity
has not yet been determined, although experiments along this line are
already under way.
A comparison of the depth of

~pression

of steel and dura-

lumin shows (see Fig. 6) that for steal the depth of impression increases with the thickness of the material while for duralumin it decreases.

As a result of a peculiarity of the testing machine used the

the vertex of the depression.

In this locality the material began to

It is obvious that thick plates of ductile

material may be stretched more easily on the upper surfaces and consequently deeper impressions obtained than with thin plates, since for
thick plates more material can flow before fracture occurs.

A similar

course of reasoning can be used to explain the decrease of depth of

nn-

pression with increasing thickr£ss of plate in the Case of material of
less ductility.

On the upper surface of the test pieces there occur

,
- ? wi~h '

high tensile stresses at the point above mentioned, which increase
tbe strength of the plate.

As the material flows only to a s.mall de-

gree, cracks very soon appear and extend into the interior.

The pro-

cess described can be followed on the sections of a steel plate of
about 40 kgs. per sq.mm. strength and a duralumin plate, Fig. 8.

The

flow before fracture of the steel plate is plainly recognizable while
the duralunin plate shows

hardl~

a sign of it.

Fig. 9 is a photograph of a test sample of strong duralumin

plate after fracture in whiCh the material suddenly split in all directions.
For flanging and pressing tempered duralumin is consequently
suitable only in the thin gauges .
. Influence of heat and cold.
Heat has an important influence on the strength of duralumin.
According to the results obtained in tests by the Central Bureau

~or

Scientific Investigation, Neubabelsberg, when heated the strength
decreases 10% for an increase in temperature of 1000 and about 20% for
an increase of 1500 (see Fig. 10).

At 2500 the elongation becomes the same as at room
With further heating the elongation increases with in-

creaSing temperature.

Consequently wherever dur.alumin is exposed to

heat the possible decrease of strength must always be considered.

The Durener-Metallwerke have also carried on for about a year,
exper~ents

on the influence of the electrolytic effect from junctions

of duralumin with iron or steel.

These were made by riveting duralumin

bars to iron plates and then placing them in artificial sea water .
There resulted only an insignificant destruction of the iron and a reduction in weight of the bars of about .23% so that no considerations
exist against the use of duralumin and iron junctions in aircre.ft.

Dural'\1ll1n has a strength of 35 to 40 kgs. per sq.mm. and an
elongation of 10 to 15%.

ThG stretching strain limit lies very high,

about 28 to 32 kgs. per Sq. meter.

The modulus of elasticity is about

600,000 to 700,000 kgs. per sq.cm.

It is very brittle especially in

thicknesses above 1 mm. ani consequently sensitive to bending to and
fro (altarnating).
Bent Plate Fittings, with bent lugs which must resist vibration are
best not made out of duralumin but of sheet steel.
