The urg e nt need for the highest p ossible number of
utilizable Iriachines, turned out in the short est possible tirr,e
gave r i S0 to such a derr.and on the airplane industry dur ing
the W(;...r, ~md there was such con stant need for im: ovn.tions
in the airplanes therr.selve s, that the manufact~rers had to
a.epand on the ir own common sense and experience 1'ather
than on scient ifi cally acquired knowledge in the e.:1rly ye a rs
of the ~ar . The results obt aine d were uncommonly successful, in spite of ther3 being no spare tirre for developing
aerodyna;nj.cal theories a.nd utilizing them as foundation
to work upon . The :nethod sui ted the time s, but such an en:pirical n,ode of testing ne i, types , constructed on unsure
b~ses, could not be continued later on.
The future of aircraf°t,j design Hill have to be entrusted t'J technically
trained engineers who are specialists in their own line of
w k.
or
The creation of systematically scientific b~ses for
the further development of airplanes will be specially
sought after; their construction, their util ization and
their efficiency will be studied, and strength calculations

Wina. t-1m~el model 'vest s have been adoptsd
extensively, but few pri.(.ctio?ol tests have been IL3.de on airplc::mes eluring fli6h"t. The f i r s t utjlizable ~ests carried
out at the ~e!'mG:l.n Testing Labol'~tory* JV3 r c; c'J.t. short by the
War. There is urgent neeQ :or auch t e sts, for it is by their
means alone tha t the v~lue of ~ojel tests, obtained under
simplified conditions, cun be vrov e d in r e spect of th 8 ir application to actual airplanes.
Wind tun~el measurement s of
l~rge models and high velocities have occasionally produced
a3"tcnishing re6ul"ts. This ShO~6 th ~ t it is only by me~ ne

conditions . in their actual succession, c a n c e rt a inly npver
be realized by means of model test s , as such conditio~s depend up on the pilot, and are maneuvers vvhich cann.ot b .=; reproducea in "t 8 st ing n.ode J s. All th8 conditions of non-steady
flight and of the ~orking of the propeller c~n certainly be
ootained in model "t es"t3 , but suc~ tests c~n only be carried
out with greet difficulty.
Up t c tne pre sent t iIte, there have be en b1),"t fe w re suI t s
of pracitcal flight tests, it being difficult to reduce the
art of aviation to the limits of regular a nd systema tic
tests. The airplane requires so many constrl4.ctional alterat ions, when its proport ions are reduced to t~le jU:lens ions
of the model, th~t the effec"t of such modifications c a nnot
al ways be fo:;.'eseen and flight tests on actual airplanes
are still dangerous, though less so tnan in former yeo.rs~
when less experience had been guined and there was l ess
excess of engine po tRer.
The ration~l st~rting poin~ of all flight t ~s ts is
steudy horizont~l flight. Me asuremen"ts of 3winging and steering conui.t ione in curved fl i ght sh ould be postpone d unt il
horizonto,l :light has be e n brou6ht to the cr'C2.rldard of our

?here 6\.re two main pOints t o be determined. in im~es:;i ­

slight alterations in th9 distrlbution of force may easily
ciisguise aerodynamical influe:lces qu~.te effectively. It is
essential, for these reasons, th~t p~rticularly sensitive
instl.'ument s should be used in measuring force s on airplanes,
and a thorough £'.cquaintance wi::h the airflo'li conditions i e.
equally necessary. It is, indeed, only when the p=opeller
efficiency, decrease of power .1itn atn"ospheric pressure, etc.
has been thoroughly g:r:oundeci thLvt such mee.surement s ca n be
taken at all . When measurements of moments are t:;.l.ken, pro peller anli angine are, on the contrary, of sm~ll import :1nc e .
Here \ve hQ.v·e to deQ.l vii t:n ~he compensation of ~ero1ynamic al
forces only in the fir st case, and they can be l!,easl.lred
filth less o.elici;..l.te apparatus.
The difficultiss here encountered are of Ci purely tec:i1nical nature, as the n~easurements
of moments neces s itate dero,nger.oents of the equilibrium
through unbalanced lo~ds or by one-sided bracing of the cellule, and the ~ilot is therefore obliged to fly in an unba.la.nced airpla.ne. The se drawbacks may, ho weve r, be met by
controlling devices and by experience on the part of the
pilot.
J

•

We now propose to deal with such me asurements of mom ents,
giving the results of the ~ction of the rudder on the posit ion of the cdrplane ~s on the equil ibriulU of the moment s.
The measurement of moments is preceded by measurements of
the dimensions of the ~oments produced by t he st eering of
the rudder in their relation to the angle of attac~. CalibrCited rudder curves c~re obt ,,\ ined by such measurements, in
the present inst~nce for the rudder and the elevator. Th is
theoretical data is closely connected \7i th the direct and
practical study of the influence of bracing on moments, and
consequently on the equilibrium of the airplane 4nd its
safety in fligh ·t . Ment ion \vill i:il so be made of the means
by which errors in position c~n be corrected.
A simple
method of bracing is thus arrived at, ~nd its direct utilizat ion is sho IV!l in the test resul ts given below.
Data on rudder efforts and the r e sultant moments has so
far been obttl.inable from -the controlling measurements taken
in the G8ttingen M
odel Testing Lu.boratory alone. iIi Such tests
c~n only be c~~ried out under simplified conditions, ~nd
they can only be applied to an Girpldn6 a fter it hus been
practically tested in flight. The G8ttingen measurements
t~ke no account of the effect of the slip stream on the
controls, a.lthough the ruider :...nd fins :::..re sensibly c.:..ffected by the slip stream, as shown by the various positions
tu..#.ell up by an ~i!'pla.ne when the engine is running, a.nd in
gliding fllght. In the GOttingen measurements the angle
of attack has been s~ccessively incre~sed by 5 oI where~s
suoh great differences never occur in the angle of attack in

The she o,i' or curves follows "tihe same general direction, converging only by 50, It may therefore be concluded that the

If the c~rrent had been djscurbed by the slip stream, there

The sweep of tce curves of th e values of Cn * found in
the G~tt ingel1 Report and reproduced in Figs. 11 and 12 is
quite similar to that of the calibrated curve in Fig. 10.
It gives the ~mpression that ths point of inflec~ion is depe ndent on the ratio of the rudder area to the total are a..
In some of ~he curves, a further pOint of inflect i o~ is shown
for larger angles of attack. The G8ttingen measurements do

reason to believe that it is p os s ible.
The Gchtingen valus E: of n:oment c annot be compared wit h
those obtaine d at Adlershof on account of the comparatively
large angle of attack in the Gottj,ngen tests . It must also
be remembered that the G~ttingen ratio bet weer- rudder surfa ce

tests in question. If mean values ~ere found for th3 two
G2>ttingen ffiodels, they would approximately correspond t o the
ratio oi 2/7.
If the value of 2 0 be interpolat e d, the scale
of dimension s of the resulting values of mome nt is similar

According "GO th6 cal iora,ted curve sho WT; in Fig . 10, the
difference of 0 . 5 0 in the eileron position corresponds to a

It is importa.nt to note 'that considerable transverse
momen:s can be brought to bear uFon the airplane (See Fig . IO)
by making comparatively small alterat~ons in the position of
the aileron, while extremely high unequalized ~oments may,
on the other hand] easily be compensated by altering the position of the aileron. Even for the highest transverse moment of 150 kg/h, an alteration of 2.0 0 in the aileron position
(applied to one aileron) is sufficient . Protracted flight

position of the perpendicular struts, the fo l lowing conclusions

v~i thin :3 m. of the cen"ter of the fuselage because the airplane runs no risk, and can continue tc fly, in spite of
the unequalized vveight and even if the bomb releEl.sing
device should get out of gear on one side. It is, therefore, not absolutely essential that the bonb-release should
act sirr.ultaneou.3ly on both sides. By means of the arra.:lgellient ~bove described, they ca~ be alternately droppeQ, It
might be advisable, however, that such aircraft should be
equipped. ,'lith re,;ersible or semi-reversible aileron centroIs, that is, Ivith ,vheel gearing, 60 that the pilot may
not be over fatigued by the unequalizeci load.ing of the
airplane.
The fact that the calibrated curve is flatter in the
center is probably due to cert~in effects of the air current
produced by the portion of the fling in front of the aileron. In case of extremely large angles (over 12° according to G8ttingen measurements), the inversion of the steep
upward portion of the curve may be antiCipated, though that
portion of the curve lies beyond the range of possible
me asurerr.8nt s .
A further series of tests nas carried out as a sequel
to those above mentioned, the differences on the right
and on the left of the angles of attack being represented,
by way of compa=ison, as unequalized displacements of the
inner struts. The results of this series of tests, e ,
are ShO,ffi in Table 4. In Figs. 14 and 15, a comparison is
dra..vn bet ween this method and the inner strut displacement
applied to the first series of tests, as regards their influence on the position of the aileron in flight with the
engine running and i~ gliding flight.
This comparison shows that unequalized transverse
moments or the drag of an airplane - , hich arr.ounts to the
.•
same thing -- may be more e::fectively corrected by a right
and left displacement of the angle of attack below the Quter
struts. A bracing under the outer struts thus has greate~
influence on the transverse position of the airplane than
bracing of the same dimension under the inner struts, in
spite of the decrease of lift towards the wing tips.
The actual difference in the angles of attack, from
right to left, is at most 1 0 from the central position,
though it may amount to 2 0 in tests. This ciisplacement
causes a strong torsion of the surfaces, plainly visible to
the naked eye. Even nith a displacement of 1 0 under the inner or outer struts, the differences affecting the aileron
are not inconsider~ble, as the trQnsverse moment amounts to
75 kg/ffi. ~n the first instance, and to 56 kg/m. in the second

instance. The follo 7ing rules may therefore be applied
to braci:lg:
The s i de-slip of an airpla~ e m y be corrected by ~l~er­
a
ing the ar.gle of attack on one side, under the in~er or
outer strut. The l~tter ~ethod is the more effective.
On the basis of test results obtained in series a
to d, . Fig. 16 fu~tcer shows how the position of the directional control is altered by transv e rse moments produced
either by adding ~eight8 or by altering "(,he angle of attack
on one side. This fi~~re clearly shows that purely transverse moments produced by weights have no ).nfluence whatever on the position of the directional rudder when the engine is running or in gliding flignt. The frequently ezpressed opinion that a aide-slip accompanies transve rse
moments causing rotation of the airplane tl1us fai1s to hold
good when such rotation is the result of moments due to
weights, and is equilibrated by altering the position .of the
aileron. This action of the aileron may be traced to the
simu1taneo~s action of both.
(In the case of moments that
make the airplane tilt laterally, there is no simUltaneous
rotation of the cellule if the airplane be disequilibrated.)
With the aileron position formerly in general use, one
side only came into play, while the opposite side remained
inert and rotaticn was the obvious result of the unequalized resistance.
In Fig. 1'7, a comparison is again dravvn bet ween the
displacement of the outer strut in tests a to d and the
displacement of the inne!' strut in series e , as re gal'ds
their influence on t he position of the a i leron. IVe kno \'v
that an unequalized alteration of the angle of attack below
the inner strut has no effect on the position of the aileron, though side-slip as well as rotation results fl'om such
alteration below the out e r struts, the position of the aileron and the directional control being thereby affected.
The fo1lovnng principles may therefore be adopted in
practice:
The rotation of an airplane can only be corrected by
altering the angle of attack below the inner struts. There
is no need to fear a consequent recurrence of side-slip.
The alteration of the angle of at~ack below the outer struts
is certainly a more efficacious means of correcting rotation, but it causes side-slip of the airplane after bracing.
Fig. 17 further shows that the directional control takes
up variou,s positions in flight with the engine running and
in gliding flight, in consequence "Of the action of the pro-

In the case of an engine r~nn~n~ Jith full l~a~; t ne

Close beside the tail-skid, a tank is built into the
rear end of the fuselage. This tank can be filled by pur: .ping from the observ e r' s cock;>i t during flight . lNhen the
tests were being carried out in Nov embe r and December, 1 917 ,
wat er coul d not be utilized on account 0: fro s t, and the
tfAll we il"p.llJ.m.@ w
ould have been stoppec. up by the addition
of k itchen salt to the vvater. The tank Ivas therefore filled
with gasoline of 0 . 720 sp ecific weight. The distance between the cent e r of the tail and the c.g. of the airplane
is taken as the lever arm of ~he long itudinal mome~ts, and
the n igrat ion of the to t al c. g . towards the rear, due to
increase of weight in the reay tank , is a ls o taken into
conside:·at ion.
Including the empty tan~:, the ins~alla: ion
we ighs 5.2 kg., and the calibrated curves of the elevator
consequently run from that pOi nt. The quantity of fuel
carried during the tests being al ways t he. s a:ile , the totE_
l
weight of the airplane and the positio~ of the c.g. remain
constan-c.
Contrary to the me~hod follo we d in the preceding tests,
the angles of attack of the m.ng s ar e altered to the same
degree on both side s of the airplane (ti.1e setting of the
wings being left unaltered) , t ha t is , the wing s aye dr a ',m
up just so much on -ehe trailing edges, below the outer
struts, as they are lowe r ed below the inner struts . The
position of the Wings relative to the engine shaft depend s
upon the w
ing chord adjustment prescribed. by the manufacturer . Incr3ased incidence is rr.arke d w:.th a mi nus , decreased incide nce With a plu s .
The te st s were carr ied. out 1 ike the earl ie r serie s
with the sole difference that a fl ight velocity of 120 km/h
was maintained in the pre sent ins-eance . The results aye

this table, the influence of the var iou s positions of the

wing ohords, as affeo:;ing the engine shaft, on the P08:!."tlOll
of the elevator .vhen flying lI'lith "the engine running and in
gliding flight (See Fi 6 s. 18 and 19) there is a notic~able
difference i~·l the s wee p of the curve s. COl1t rary to the results of previous tests (Figs. 6 to 9), the curve sheaves
do r-ot aeviate in parallel directions, but in different directions. This confirms the belief that it is not only the
deviation of the air current behind t~e w
ings, and the
lift of the fixed part of the stabilizer that act as air
forces on the controlling part of the fuselage, but that
the position of the elevator' is a.J.so cOllsiderably influenced by the propeller wash. As the measurements ~Bre rr.ade
with the engine running and in gliding fligdt, at the same
altitude, on the same day, and at the saree flight velocity, that is, vJi th the sarr,e irr,pact pre ssure, the deviat ion of
the air current of the wings - ias -che same for both methods
l
of flight. The difference in the curve is t herefore due
to the fact that the characteristic values of the lift of
the fixed plane are different in gliding flight from those
in flight with the engine running, on aocount of the unequalized angle of at~ack and the air eddy of the propeller.
The impaot pressure, \ 1 ~~ ) during the tests amounted
( 2 gVRl )
,
to 68 kg/sq . m. The angle of attack, in fli6ht with the
engine running and in gliding flight, oo~ld not be successfully measured, the apparatus speoially designed for the
purpose proving defective at the first test . In spite of
this, it oould be seen that ~here is little variation in
the angles of attack ~ith the engine running and in gliding
flight, so the alteration in the first approximation may
be stated as null.
The calibrated curves of the el e Vator (Fig. 30) , which
are take n from tha test results, compri se the influence of
all three kiIlds of air foroes on the cor.trolling devices
and on the position of the elevator. The possibility of
oaloulating, from the Gcttingen :iieasurements, a calibrated
curve takin;s no account of the influence of the propeller
wind, provides an opportunity of yhecking the curves in
question by comparison with the Gotti::1gen measurements and
determining, at the same time, to '.vhat extent a calibrated
ourve based partly on theory and partly on mea,surements
t~ken in the wind tunnel can be applied in p ractice.
For the calculation of the oalibrated curve, simi1ar
angles of attack were pre su~ed for fl·ight with the engine
running and for gliding fli&ht.

The controll~ng moment ML is algebraically composed
of the filomant MZ of the addi t iiona1 we ight and the wing

The normal air force symbol Cn for the controlling

- 21 The se mOIUer-t s, V\i t i~ the ;i.ni t ia:i mome; nt 19. 4 m/kg. a.re
marked. in dott e d lines in Fig. 20; the calio:'a.ted C1;.rve runs
in a st:raight line mid'lVay between the curves for flight with
th e engine running for gliding flight, and this leads to the
conclusion tilat the G~ttingen tests coincide remar}:aoly with
the tests dur:ng flight, carried out quite independently.
The difference between the curves calculated v
nthout including the inf111ence of the propeller vva..sh on the controlling
deVices, and the curves found in actual tests, constitutes
a d irect standard measurement for the influ~~ce of th ~ propeller on the controlling device both in flight with tile engine running and in gliding flight.
Figs. 21 and 22 show that the lines of long itudinal moment
c1 imb rnO:i:e steeply in flight ~'Vi th the engine running than in
glidtng flight. From this and frol'!'l the calibrated cur..res, it
may fur~her be seen that tha elevator is more effective in
flight vvith the e:lgine running thaD in gliding fli ght. It
follows that if the airplane cann~t be right ed in a steep nosedive, even wh.::n the eleYator is at its J.arges~ ang:e, it may
possibly be done by putting -the e:lg i ne at full th~pttle.
At the same time, the flight veloc:;' ty i s 8.1so incr eased and the
lifting force of the wings augmented. ?light 17it h the engine
running is less suitable for testi ng lo ng it~dinal stability
and steering capacity of an airplane tY P8 than gliding flight .
If the elevating control has been incorrectly measured, the
airplane wil~onlY crash when it is gliding at a steep angle;
the larger the angle of the elevator in a steep glide, the
greater is the difference between the longit~dinal moments
produced by the rudder (lifting moments) in gliding flight
and in flight with the engine running. The airplane can therefore be steered in flight with the engine rUTIl1ing at an angle
that would not be possible for gliding flight, as the moment
produced \ll ould be insufficient.
It is furthe r shown, in Fig s. 21 a~d 22, that w
hen the
angle of a~tack of the Wings is increased, the long itudinal
rr.oments corresponding to t he angle of the eie v a~or ir-crease
with the same velocity. As a result, the curves i n Fig. 22
are flatter than those in Fig. 21, in gliding flight more noticeably than in flight With the engine running. With the
same angle of attack and at the same velocity, the angle of
the elevator is larger in flight with the engine running than
in glj.ding flight; that is, tile airplane is nose-heavy wi thin
altitudes of less than 4000 m. - which is the test limit - if
it has been equilibrated for fli ght .nth the engine l~nning.
When it is equili.bra-ced for gliding fl i ght , it is tail-heavy
in flight with the engine running. Wi th a vie iV to overcoming these differences in the flight of an airplane under the
two flight conditions, the fixed pa~t of the stabilizer has
been so disposed as to be adjustable from the pilot's seat J
by means of a self-locking hand-wheel. This system has been

- 22 -

cl1iefly a.do,P-ted in Eng land. The airplane can thus be e q\.:.ilibr&t e d Unc.3r ar.y tnol'Vll condition of flight - with the engine
running or in gliding flight; - at a given altitude, with a
give n angle of attack and with a g iven velocity . No effort is
required on the part of the pilot, because the elevator is
not ca~led into action. No sooner does one of these factors
undergo an alteration, however, than the equ i.llbrium is again
di s turoea and can or-Iy be restored by the readjustment of the
fi~ed plane or by the action of the elevator.
If an alteration takes place in all the above-named influences, brusquely
as in the case of steep gl iding v
v.'.th the engir:e stopped, it
may so~e tim e s happen that the increase in t~e . elev~tor angle
no longer suffices for the adjustable fixed planes. On this
account, the:::-e is some objection to adjusta-ole fixed planes.;
to begin wit~, the ~ilot can compensate his airplane for only
on~ flight condition, at high altitudes, through altering
the position of tile fixed. part. This derangement of the equilibrium when passing to another condition
worxing may be
dangerous in the case tvi th airplanes with extremely marked
variations of position and s pe ed, such as fighting monoplanes,
for instance, especially ~h~n the c. g . is located high up
on account of the position of the pilot!s seat and the machinegun, as in German fighting monoplanes with a stationary engine .
T~e adjustable tail plane is favorable for airplanes in
which the c. g. varies c onsiderably during fl~. gbt (as, for instance, through the we"\.ght of bombs app:"
_ied ~~n front 0: or
qehind the resultant of the air-forces in night-bombing or
giant airplanes) as the p ilot can cons i.de :r.ably lighten the
elev.a tol' , aft e l' bombs have been dropped, by read justing the
· fixed pl~ne.
In a:rplane s of the newest types, ~he adjustment of the fixed part sca.rcely needs to be taken into account, there b e ing no marked alterations in the fljght conditions. The same ::ilay be said of la:::-ge size or g iant airplanes.

SUMMARY OF TEE

T~ST

RE SULTS.

1. C airplanes with t~o struts ar e extremely susceptible to aileron maneuvers, slight alterations of the a~lero~
sufficing to compensate g:eat unequal ized moments.

2. Great unequalized morLlents can be produced or neutralized by the unequalized alteration of the a~gle of attack be10'IV the out3r or i:mer strut s.
Adjust!llent belo w t he outer strut
is the more effective method of the two. Contrary to the effect of alterations in the angle of attack below the outer
struts, moments resulting from weights and alterations in t~e
position of the inne r struts cause nc side-slip in the airplane.
3.
When a load of bombs is suspende d beyond the center
of the airplane, be low the wings, the bombs nee d not be dropped
on both sides simultaneously.

.- 23 ~.
The propelle r wash of a wide open e~gin e has considerable influence on the position and working of the elevator. T~e elevator is more susceptible in flight ~vj. th the
engine ruaning than in gliding flight.

5. Adjustable taii planes are not advisable for D
airplanes, nor for the C tY ye, but they are, on the other
hand, to be recommended for lar ge size ~nd giar-t airplanes
in which the c.g. changes Guring flight.
6. The aileron values obtained by wind-tunnel n·, easurements are about 10% too low, though other i'1::'se applicable.
For the elevator, the results of such meas14rements should be
taken as mean values bet ween flight w
ith the engine running
and gliding flight.
