The purpose of this report is to outline briefly the salient features of operation of the hightension magneto, and of the simik battery ignition systems, and to trace the various traneforrnationa of energy which take place. The resulte of numerous measurements on such systmna
as have been studied at the Bureau of E%andards will “be quoted in illustration of these properties. These phenomena are doubtless .underetiod by magneto designens, but with the exception
of the excellent papera by Armagnat and Young referred b“ below, the literature of the subject,
is very meager and consiste chiefly in elementary expositions for the instruction of’ the amateur
automobilist.
Thti cycle of operations of a jump-spark system can be divided into a number of periods.
During each period the electrical phenomena proceed under fairly definite and constant conditions, each period being separated from the one preceding and the one following it by an

OUTLINE OF OPERATION.

.

The high tension magneto combines in a single machine the functions of an electric generator
and of an induction coil, and these two functions are to a considerable extent independent of
one another.
The circuite of a high-tension magneta are substantia~y as shown in figure 1, Fbei@ the
primary winding which has a few turns of coarse wire and consequently a low resistance, whiIe
the secondary winding S has several thousand turns of fine tire.
The two coils are wound one
over the other on a common iron core, which (in the ordinary or shuttle type) has the form
shown in figure 3. Condenser Cl is connected across the terminals of F primarily to reduce
capacity between the secondary

winding or high tendon leada and the grounded frame of the machine is sufEciently large to
have a mat&al effect on the operation,
This capacity is in part distributed along the windings
and various portions are consequently subject to different voltages.
The effect of this capacity
may, however, be approximately
re~rwented by an e~uivale~t condenser connected as shown

In the actual ma=meto the primary resistance materhilly reduces the generated curi-ent
and the actual flux at break is (ss shown in plot 20) considerably less than the maximum
open circuit flux.
It should be noted that there is a very considerable difference in the operation of a magmeto
at low and at high speeds. In the former case, the primary current is limited chiefly by the
r=istance of the windinga and has approximately
the same wave form as the generated voltage.
The maximum current reached ia proportional to the speed and is small so that the total energy
stored magnetically is also small. Consequently at “break” nearly all of this energy must be
tranefemed to the electrostatic capacity of the windings and condenser before the voltage is
su.fticiently high to jump a normal spark plug gap. At high speeda on the other hand the
current is limited by the inductance of the circuit and is nearly independent of speed. The
current and magnetic energy we very much greater and ogly a negligible part of ~
energy

Tlgs effect is
shown in plot 2 I in which the current generated in the shorhcircuitid

Since
it is impossible without the expenditure of itite
power to abruptly change the current in an
inductive circuit, the primary current now flows into the condenser rapidly chargi~o it. The
charge in the condenser offers a continually increasing electromotive force in opposition to the
primary current, which therefore decreasw at a constantly increasing rate.
The decrease of
flux resulting from this decrease of primary current generates an E. ~. F. in the secondary winding

For our

PERIOD 3.

iI

When the gap has broken down it affords a conduct~@- path, and the charged secondary
capacity and leads immediately
discharge through it. The exact conditions existing in the
spark, pmticularly immediately after breakdown,
are stiU ob~cnre, and it is possible that this
first discharge may be oscillatory and of high frequency.
Tests made by loosely coupling a sensitive wa~e meter to the secondary circuit of a magneto have shown no indication of resonance with any oscillations within the range betwean 30,000
and 1,000,000 cycles, although the apparatm used was suiliciently sensitive to have detected a
steady oscillation of 0.2 milliampere throughout the range.
A circuit formed by connecting a
loop from one point of the distributor to ground was found to absorb oscillations of frequencies
from 3,000,000 to 10,000,000 cycles per second for various configurations of the loop, but no
such absorption vw detected at frequmcies from 2,0~— to 3“0,000 cycles per second.
Any
oscillations which may have been present must therefore have been very feeble or very highly
damped.
In addition to this discharge of the leads, the current increases rapidly in the secondary,
since it is now practically short-circuited
by the gap; and the primary current simultanemdy
decreases at such a rate that the total ampere turns linking the main flux are maintained with
little loss. The charged primary condenser hastens the decrease of primary current and uItimatdy reve~es it for a short we while the condenser energy is-being shifted to the secondary
side. The dissipation of energy in the gap, however, is probably euflicient to damp out any
oscillations from this condenser.
The net results of the three simultaneous processes during this period are, therefore, (a) the
discharge into the gap of the energy stored in the capacity of the leads; (b) the complete stipping of the primary current and the formation of a secondary current giving approximately
the same ampere turns; and (c) the tilpation
in the windings and gap of the energy in the
primary condenser.. The duration of the period is of the order of one cycle of an oscillation,
detaznined by the primary condenser and the leakage inductance of the windings (approximately 0.00005 second).
The energy discharged into the gap d&ng this time is about 0.002
joties, which recent measurements indicate js just about sufficient to ignite am explosive mixture.
It is therefore probable that this period 3 is the one fundamental to ignition,
PERIOD 4.
Period 4 extends from the establishment of the secondary current in a steady arc across the
spark gap to the extinction of the spark.
During this time there exists across the gap a steady
discharge which lasts for a considerable time (0.003 second in the case of a 5-mm. spark gap in
air). It has been found experimentally
that the voltage drop in the gap iE roughly constant
during this entire period, as is shown by oscilIograma such as figure 16. The capacities therefore
remain with a small charge and have little effect on the phenomena.
The energy dissipated in
the gap is supplied by the decay of the secondary current in the coil, and since the voltage. is

The stopping of the steady arc and consequently the end of period 4 maybe due to one or
the other of two causes.
These are (a) the exhaustion of the energy supply which results in
the gradual reduction of the current to zero and the cessation of the arc, as is shown in &ures
11 and 14, or (b) the closing of the primary breaker which has the effect of quickly =tinguishing
the spark, ae is shown at a in figure 13. In the former case there is at very small currents a
rather rapid increase of the sustaining voltage (as &t a, @e
16) to a value which at the instant
of cessation of the spark may be double its normal value.
The secondary current consequently
drops to zero at a somewhat more rapid rate than during the major portion of period 4. The
“ natured” or uninterrupted
dying out of the spark usualIy occurs in magnetos operating at
moderate speeds and with reasonably long spark gaps, and almost in-ra.riably occurs in battery
systems... It may be considered as the normal mode of operation of the syhmi.
Owing to the large number of variables (such as current at break, rotational energy, and
extinction of the spark by the closing breaker) which affect the total heat liberated in the gap: it
is impracticable

The sequence

formed of the secondary winding and spark, so that the rate of decrease of current is quite
slow, and an appreciable current maybe flowing, when the position of maximum flux is reached,
and period 1 of the next alternation begins.
In some cases this interference may be so great as to cause the succeeding spark to miss
fire as shown in figure 17. In cases where the spark dies out before the closing of the breaker,
period 6 follows immediately after period 4 and the circuit k practically free from current

During the interval after the dying out of the spark and before the closing of the breaker
there may remain a small amount of local eddy currents in the iron core and pole pieces. &

The energy which can be stored in the magnetic field during this period is usually decidedly

The battery system usually operates on 6 or 12”volts,-’whtie a magneto may give a primary
peak voltage from 50 to 100 volts at b.igh speed. The battery, however, maintains ite voltage
at all speeds while the magneto may give only 4 or 5 volts peak at 100 revolutions per minute.

windings with an alternating current bridge at frequencies up to 3,000 cycks throw some light
on this problem, and if a convenient way of interprethig
the results can be vvorked out, this
method may prove useful.
The requirements of an ignition system are quite different from almost any other form of
electric generating system and me in some respects conflicting in character.
A high voltage is
required to jump the spark gap through the cqmprwsed gas in the engine cylinder.
Ti’bile
this is usually only 6,000 to 6,000 volts, it maybe very materially increased by oil fllma on the
electrodes and a cold and consequently dense charge when starting an engine.
Such a high
voltage, of course, requires a large number of secondary turns.
On the other hand, the spark
plugs frequently become coated with a conducting film of carboq, vrh!ch drains the energy
during period 2 in much the same manner as the eddy currents.
It then becomes necessary to
supply such a large current that the IR drop in the carbon deposit is equal ta the sparking
voltage of the gap in order to produce a spark.
Siice the secondary current during periods
3 and 4 is limited b the value which produces the same ampere turns around the armature
core as did the primary current before “break,” this second condition requirw a small number of
secondary turns.
Recent measurements at the British National Physical Laboratory indicate that the actual
energy required for ignition is very small compared to that furnished by any commercial form
of ignition system, and any excessive amount of power is slightly detrimental in that it increases
burning of the spark plug and contact breaker termids.
The paradoxical requirement
is
therefore for a system furnishing large current and voltage but small power.
A possible solution to this problem lies in the use of a suitable subsidiary spark gap and
condenser as used in the lkdge arrangement
and similar high frequency systeins, in which
the voltage is made as great as possible and the large current required by a fouled plug is
obtained by the sudden discharge of a condenser through the auxiliary gap. The presence of
the condenser, however, tends to reduce tie maximum voltage att@nable and-to some extent
defeats its own purpose.

TRANSFORMATION RATIO AND COUPLING IN HIGH TENSION MAGNETOS.’
By

SIISBEE.

RIWJMM.
This report describm a convenient method for measuring the ratio of turns of high tension
magnetos or induction coils. Two resistanoas are connected betwe~ the high tension terminals and ground, and a galvanometers is connected between the junction of the resistances
and the junction of the primary aad secondary windings.
The resistances are then adjusted
until no kick of the galvanometers occurs when the magnetic flux through the coils is suddenly
varied.
This variation in flux maybe made by moving the rotor of the magneto or by interrupting a current in either windhg.
From measurements by both methods an estimate of the
ma=guetid leakage and coupling coefficient is obtained.
ResuIts obtained on various mapetos
by this method are given. The ratios are usually between 40:1 and 70:1, and the magnetic
leakage flux is only 2 to 4 per cent of the flux common to both windings.

INTRODUCTION.

A knowledge of the ratio of turns or more strictly the ratio of magnetic linkages between
the primary and secondary windinga of ma=wetos or spark coils is frequently neaded, both in
predicting the performance to be expected from a given coil and in an~yzing the results of
. oscillographic tests, etc. The method which is described in this report is similar to the alternating current methods used in obtaining the ratio of transformers and no claim is made for
novelty in respect to it. It has, however, bean found very useful in connection with the investigation of ignition probkcs
and is capable of all the accuracy needed in such work.

In case only moderate accuracy is needed, any low range direct current ndliammeter
or millivoltmetar is suitable.
With the connections as shown the magnetic flux through the windings
is suddenly varied, as by rotating the armature 180 electrical degrees, and the remlting throw
of the gahwnometer noted.
The resistance l?, (or R,) is then varied until this throw is reduced

and a consideration of the magnetic circuit, as
indicated in figure 3, shows the values of this ratio to be expected in the various cases.. For
the circuite shown in figure 1~, in which only the field of the permanent magnet is used, it is
evident-from figure 3, that some of the flux will pass through the secondary coil without linking
the primary,
