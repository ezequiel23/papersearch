DEVELOPMENT OF AERONAUT’CAL E@ INES BY THE 2JUJYAND NAVY.
I
Development of certain types of engines by the Army an~
,.

Navy Air Services has been recently approved by the Secretary
.,.

,

-.,

of War and the Secretary of the Navy upon recotiendation of
the Aeronautical Board.
These en~ines have been arranged into three groups, namely:
Enginesj the development and use of which are of
mutual interest to the Army Air Service and to
the Navy Air Service.
(b) Engines, the development and use of which are primarily of interest to the Army Air Service.
(c) Engines, the development and use of ‘~ich are of
interest primarily to the Navy Air Service.

(a)

,X

In thus dividin~ these eng$.nesinto three classes, it
should.
be noted that class (b) and class (c) will, by the process of elimination in a great rianycases, be merged wl*h
class (a). It is believed that engines now placed in class
(b) will never be entirely without interest and value to the
Navy Air Service, nor will engines for the Fresent placed in
class (c) be entirely without interest and V~LIUeto the ArmY
Air Service. The list of engines by class is as follows:
Class (a) Of mutual interest to the Army and Navy Aiz Ssrt’ices.

50-60 H.P.
An engine of this power is available but further develop~
ment of this type of engine has been assigned to the Navy
Department.

engine for installation in aircraft used in training.

This engine
step towards the development of a durable} relatively cheap
engine for trailiing
purposes, or for small shipboard aircraft. It should be noted that this engine is of a greater
power than either of the engines betng developed under
class (a)”for training purposes and of less power than the
350 H.P. air-cooled engine being developed under class (a).
Its development is desirable fo~ training purposes since
the requirements of the Naval Air Sewice are such that
greater powers are needed in aircraft fo?utraining than axe
required by the Army-Air Service. Likewise, it is desirable to have availa-~le engine of doiiestic
an
ma-nufaciure
of about this power corresponding with cextain well-known
engines of foreign manufacture, for use in small shipboard
and other type aircraft.

253 to 275 H.P, engine.
This engine is io be cleveioped
for use in a ‘~win-engined
airplane or seaplane designed as a torpedo carrier, bomber,
or spotting ~OaGhine. It should be noted that the total
power of these engined, as contemplated SOr a twin-engined

installation, is approximately equal to ihat of the 550
H.P. engine noted under class (a), but the development of
the smaller ei~gineappears to be desirabie f~om considerations of maneuverability and ease of installation in Naval
aircxaft designed a~ torpedo carriexs,
650 to ’750H.P. watez-cooled engine,,
The development of a larger type engine for rigid airships
appears to be desirable, in view of the increase in size
of this type of aircraft, with a view to reducitigcwplication of power plan% to the greatest extent practicable without undue concentration. weights, and at present, it apof
pears that 650 to 750 H.P. represents the maximum power
and weight that was practicable to concentrate in a single
unit for this purpose. To be developed by the Navy Department.
Steam engines.
The development of the steam engine is to be continued at

-4once, and worked to a definite conclusion as rapidly as
possible.
Geared en~ines :
The Navy is now engaged in the development of the geared
engine for use in its aircraft.
It is pro-~ablethat the develo~~mentOf both ai~-cooled
and waater-cooled
engines of the power noted ‘will
be desirable.
it will be seen the continuance of existing development work
and the inception of other projects coverin~ an extremely wide
field of engines, both as to power and as to type, has been determined upon.

Such wide and detailed development is ex~remely

necessary at this time in order that the availability, or lack
of engines of a Given type, may not prevent the development of
types of aircraft of the greatest utility.
.
The importance and possible value of the development of an
internal combustion engine of turbine type is being followed by
the War and Navy Departments and there are scme indications
.,
that increased progress in aeronautics.
will warrant its development in the near future.
