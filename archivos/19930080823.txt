This is, however, not to be taken literally, for the deflec·tion of a rod. in proportion to its length cannot exceed cer-cain

The conclus ions. of this investigation app:Ly

tfiereiore to comparatively small deflections of the roj and to rods
which originally were perf e ctly straight, s ymmetrical and of uni-fOrm material.

Wi-;:;h these reservations, the fonnula and th e

That the deflection, according to Euler, for the load

•

- 23 The difference in the two oases is due to the faot that, in the
t ransvers ally loaded rod t he bending moments are independent of t te
deflections while in the axially loaded rods they are proportional
to the deflection.
The oonolusion drawn from the discussion of 1uler's formula
that an axially loaded rod should not deflect any measurable amount
and that no gradual increase in deflection should correspond to the
gradually increasing load, is, however, not generally oonfirmed by
experiments.

For instanoe, Fig. 6 shows the lateral defleotion in

It follows f r om the curves that, although the deflections grow
rapidly with the load, the crippling of the rod does not ooour very
suddenly.
This contradiction might be attributed to the fact that the
modulus of e lasticity

E

does~ot

remain quite oonstant as the

stress increases Or that either the cross-sections of the rod are
not perfectly symmetrical or the material is not uniform, Or also,
that the rod was not perfeotly straight before the load was applied.

The last point seems, however, unessential as the practically

SUMMARY.

The formulas hitherto employed for calculation of rods sub ject
to compression, are usually of value only for stout or for $lender
rods.

They do not cover l as a rule, the whole range of rod lengths,

or they give too great a safety factor for short and mOderately
large rods.

Therefore, a new em
pirical formula, equation (8), has

been devel oped, that holds good fOr any length and any material of
the rod,

agrees well with the results of extensive strength

To facilitate the calculations, three tables are included.

giving the crippling load for solid and hollow sectioned wooden
rods of different thic'k ne s a and length, as well as for steel tubes
manufactured according to the standards of Army Air Service Inspection (Idflz) .
~reaking

Further, a graphical method of calculation of the

load is derived (Fig. 4) in whiCh a single curve is employ-

ed for determination of the allowable fiber stress.
Finally, the theorY is discussed of the elastic curve fOr a rod
subject to compression, according to which no deflection occurs,
and the apparent contradiction of this conclusion by test results is
att r ibuted to the fact that the rods under cest are not perfectly
straig ht, or that the wall thickness and thl; material are not uni-

- 34 fOrm.

Under the assumpt ion of

aJl e ccen~

ric roc, having a slight

initial b end accord ing to a sine curve, a simple formula fo r tts
deflect ion is derived, Nhich SLOWS a sUrpris ing agree:nent -;7i th test
results .
na~ion

From this a further formula. is derived fOr the determi-

of the allowable load on an eccentric rod.

The resulting

relations are made clearer by rr.ea:lS of a graptical reiJrese:'1 tat ion
of the relation of the moments of the outer and inner forces (Fig.
7) to the def l ect:'on,

and. through the determination of equilibrium

oetween moments.
