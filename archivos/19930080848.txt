THE PROBLEM OF FUEL FOR AVIATION ENGHJES.

*

The speaker be gan by mentioning the physical propert i es
which may be dema..'1ded of fuels for aviat ion use and the means
that may be adopted by the engine maDufacturers to properly
meet the demands necessitated by the use of such fuel.
In the ch oice of a fuel the fOllowing factors must be considered:

(1) its composition;

(2) the quantity available;

(3) t he pr ice per heat unit; CL.Yld (4) the p o ssibility of kee pi:1g
stocks in ae ri al p orts both at home a:r:d abroad.

It is also im-

portcmt to kno'vv if the change from one fuel to another will neces s it a te any se rious mod ification of the engine .

The s torir.g of fuel in the airplane and supplying it to the
engine are other poir.ts to be considered .

Gaseous fuel , which

woul d have to be taken on boardl in large gas bags or in airtight cylinders, cannot be cons idere d as the primary fuel on ac.count of the space occupied by and the weight of such containers .

At best it might be carri ed in liquid form in heat-proof

cont a ine rs.

Solid fuels Yvhich might be pulverized or are in

the form of powder (explo s ive material) cannot be considered, al th oug h liquefiab le or solub le Iuels such a s napthaline or par-

Con side ring the fact

ground in t he intense heat o f sumn:er and also at high altitudes
in the severe ccld. of winter, the question of fue l supply is not
of the simplest b e cause many fuels lese their

such as may occur in forced l andings.

iently inflammable mixture in the engine cylinder.
These conditions have not yet been fulfilled.

Apart from

insuring the safety of all the fue l pipes by double tubes and
double jackets, they might be met satisfactorily in two ways.
In th e first of these use could be made of an

eY~losive

fuel

that evaporates easily, such as gasoline or benzol, supplied in
such a manner that there is no possibility of delivering fuel
to the engine in excess of its instant requirements.

For this

purpose the fuel in the trulk would have to be c ondense d to such
an extent or kep t at such a low temperature that it resembles
an ointment in fluidity and wi 11 not flow out of a leaky tal'lk or
it might be absorbed by some special substance to prevent its
escape.

In the second way, fuels could be used that do not read7 .

ily gasify , i. e ., fuels with high boiling points and flash points.
The carburetor would be so designed or the intake air and fuel
would be brought to such a condition in the

mfu~ifold

or in the

cylinder that mixing and i gni ti on would be sat isfac-tory.

The im-

portant question of the utilization of fuels of lower inflammability and

conse q~en tly

of highe r boiling point

~~d

lower cost

would thus depend on the engine.
The preparat ion of the fuel mixture in the carburetor was
then dis cussed .

The carburetor functions primarily as an e jector

pump as sho\m in Fig. 1.

its metering relations

- 13 Another difficulty arises through the fact that not only the principal fuel, but also the lubri cat ing oil used may turn the scale
in causing spontaneous i gn ition.

Hopkinson* made a remarkable

test wi th an engine usi!.1g ordiD.ary gas, in which he tried. to
bring about prema.ture ignition with the aid of a red-hot plug,
the temperature of whi ch he measured wi th th e rmo-element s..

It

was not until the temperature of the plug was 600 0 to 700 0 that
premature ignition took place.

If a drop of lubricating oil fell

on the plug or on the exhaust valve~ a temperature of 400 0 sufficed for spontaneous ignition.

The difficult qp.estion as to

what part is played by lubricating oil in spontaneous ignition,
reminding one of spontaneous igni tion in air c ompresso rs, here
plainly cr cps up again .
An esserrtial pr ovision for th e safe operation of engines
with prepaTed fue l mix.tures i g nited in the engine by means of a
special ignition pin is that the cor.1pression temperature should
remain far. lower than that of spontan eous ignit ion under all conditions.

By s e lecting suitab le fuel and suitable lubricating

oil, it is certain that seve ral important economical advant ages
might be at tained .

The first step necessary would be the sys-

tematic i nvestigation of the properties ment ioned, name ly , the
boiling points, saturation and spontaneou~ ignition temperatures
of fue ls considered us able , and the effec t of these characteristics on the perfo rma nce of the fue l in the engine.
