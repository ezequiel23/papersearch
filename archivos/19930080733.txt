Each blade is built up of wooden laminations in which
are securely embedded the ends of eight threaded rods.

The

butt end,

is cylindrical, fits into a steel cup, the

bottom of

is pierced by eight holes through which

the ends of the rods project.

These a.re helci by nuts on

the outside in order to resist centrifugal force.
