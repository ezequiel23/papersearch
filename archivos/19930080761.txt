In this re-

spect, and partly on account of the war, there have been many
changes, so that in the opinion of the author, within two years at
the latest the small Diesel engine will gradually replace the hitherto common automobile engine.

It is assumed that the future en-

gine will be fully adapted to the new purpose, which will require
various structural. changes in the regular Diesel engine.

The main

character stic of the ~ie sel engine, that of intreducing the fuel
in the most finely divided condi% ion possible into the highly heated air charge, must howeve~ be retained, since it is to this very

in this connect ion, and

still more the suggest ions made for the construction of these parts,
are innumerable, notwithstanding that there is only one possibility
for poly-cylinderengines,

especially for swift -running engines.

The fuel (however small in amount) required for each combustion
must be measured to each cylinder by a special metering valve.
Since the fue 1 pump cannot exert any real suction, the fuel must
led to it from the cent airierunder moderate compression of about
O. 3 atmosphere, v?hich can be generated by a small special air pump.
In this connection, care ~iustbe taken t o admit no air into the fuel
pump and, since small air bubbles cannot be prevented from flowing
with the fuel toward..
the pump, provision must ‘oemade for ,removing
this air.

Above all, the pump itself must be so const rutted that

not the smallest air bubbie c-anremain in it.
Fuel- pumps for poly-cy linde r engines with only one rcet ring

equal quantities t o the different cylinders, have been abandoned
as iupracticable.

Just as impracticable are the pumps in which,

stead of ‘measuring the fuel, the spraying pressure is regulated.
For poly-cylinder engines, such regulating, which may indeed answer
for a one-qylinder engine, always gives unequal fuel cli tribut ion,
s
since the flow-resistance of the different nozzles is never the same,
even with the most carefi1 adjustment.
For

If the engine,
