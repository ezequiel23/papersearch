This report was prepared for the hTatioual Adtiory
Committee for Aeronautics and is
based upon an analysis of a Iarge number of airplane engiie tests made at the Bureau of
Standards.
It contains the resdk
of a search for fundamental relatiom between the many
ww.-iables of engine operakion.
The data used came from omr 100 groups of tests made upon se~eral engines, primarily
for military information.
The types of engines were the Liberty 12 and three models of the
Hkpano-Suiza.
The tests were made in the altitude chamber, where conditions simulated
altitudes up to about 30,000 feet, with engine speeds rauging from 1,200 to 2,200 r. p. m. The
compression ratios of the difkrent engines ranged from under 5 to owr 8 to 1. The data taken
on the tests were exceptionally complete, including many pre.smres a~d temperatures, besides
the brake and friction torques, rates of fuel and air consumption, the jacket and exhaust heat
~o~ses.
With the Liberty engine, operaiing at from 500 to 2,000 r. p. m. and with the HkpanoSuiza 300 h. p. operating from 1,400 to 2.,200, it k found that the friction torque increases
appro.simate~y as a linear function of en@e speed at a given air density, and approximately as
a hnear function of density at a constant speed.
This means that the friction horsepower
increases appro.ximately as the square of the speed.
Actually the reIation of torque and speed
is such that the friction horsepower increases with speed raised t.o a power between the first
and second, this pow-er increasing with speed, approaching the square.
The relation depends
upon the engine design and speed and density of the air. Any statements as to the distribution
of the friction losses are based upon incomp~ete evidence; the indications are, howe-rer, that the
pumping losses are about half of the total friction.
There is no doubt that for a giwn process of combustion and at a constant speed the engine
power is directly proportional to the ~eight of charge supplied; in other words, proportional
to the charge density at the beginning of compression.
.&s a consequence, if operating conditions
are sensibly constant except for altitude, the engine power -w-iIlbe closely proportional to the
air density.
The -volumetric efhciency increases with increase of air temperature at constant
pressure, so that power does not decrease as fast as the air density when the temperature is
raised, due to changes in =mporizaiion and heat transfer.
In order to compare the action of the gasoline engine with the theoretically perfect heat
engine operating on the same cycle, it is necewiry to base the heat balance gf the actual en=tie
upon the heat actually made a~aiIable by combustion, not upon the heat supplied in the fuel.
By summing up the eshaust and jacket heat losses with the brake power, an approximation is
made of the true heat a-railabIe, accurate to within perhaps 5 per cent.
Basing the heat. balance
upon the heat thus accounted for, it is f airl-y well est abh%hed that. the ener=gy distribution is
not appreciably altered by change of either altitude or speed.
It is, of course, aIkred by

the same as the theoretical rejection of heat computed for the same compression ratio.

L 1N7!RODUCTION.

This report was prepared for and by the directiou of the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics, and is an analysis of a large nymbcr of tests made in the altitude laboratory of
the Bureau of Standards.
Many of the tests used in this report were made upon engines
supplied by the Aviation Section, Signal Corps, United States Army, and the Army Air Service,
Engineering Division, McCook Field._ Much of the. work was made possible by the hearty
cooperation and aid of the National Advisory Committee for ihronautics, the Army Air Servicej
the hTavy Department, and the Bureau of Mines.
The very nature of this report depends upon data taken during a, long period of time,
under the sup er-risiori of Messrs. W. S. James and S. W: Spmrow.

D. R. Harper, 3d, contributed much to the value of the papw.

Only one set of friction runs wherein the engine was throttled was available.
This was
made upon a Hispano-Suiza engine, 300 h. p., and is shown in figure 2-H, 1,800 r. p. m. Such
results were converted to approximately the equivalent value -with open throttle by subh-acting
from the observed throttled friction m. e. p. the change of pressure difference between the mhaust and intake manifoIds.

greater than the suction pressure in the cylinder; it is possible that the net msulfi of this approximate
ion may not be far from the truth.
There are also unknown changes of area of tho lower
loop of the card, due to change of compression line, of fuel vaporization, etc., with change of
throttle position.
The above metthod has been used in a latier chapter (see fig. 4, Part IIJ.) for

The mean effecti~e pressure required to pump “the charge apparently varies directly with
the air density at a given engine speed, as shown Ori figures. 5, agreeing with the hypothesis that
the weight of air handled at constant speed, and hence the pumping work, should vary directly
with the density.
The proportion of the total friction -which is used in overcoming the pumping losses is
shown for the Liberty engine on figure 6–L,. and for the 13.isp

It is evident that the two engines have very different pumping charac~eristics.
CONCLUS1ONS
RESPECTINGFRICTIOX LOSSES.
An empirical and approximate statement, applicable to the speccl and density ranges herein
covered, is that the friction torque (m. e. p.) increases as a linear function of speed at Q constant,
air density, and as a linear function of air density at a constant speed. This applies t.o both
the Liberty 12-cylinder and the Hispano-Suiza 8-cylinder engines and is shown on figures 3
and 4. A.ctually, the true relations of friction torque, engine speed, and fiir density am much

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
‘lXe indicated power of a four-stroke cycle internal combustion engine may be defined m
the power developed inside the cylinders derived from the combustion of the fuel, and is obti~imxl
by adding the friction power (including pumping losses) to the brake power.
change of piston
friction due to the inc:eased pressures in the cylinder when the engine is operating seemed to
be the most probable ‘source of error when determining the indicated power by this method,
However, a consideration of all the evidence, including actual indicator diagrams, leads to the
conviction that indicated power is correct when obtained from brake plus friction.
CHANGE OF INDIC.4TED
MEAN EFFECTIVE PRESSURE WITH BAROME’i’RIC
PRESSURE.
For a given engine the indicated horsepower may be expressed as i. m. e. p. times speed
times a constant.
It is shown later that the work obtainable from unit weight of air is. independent of speed but is dependent upon conditions of operation, for example, mixture ratio.
Hence, at a given density, variation in i. m. e. p. must be due .+ber to a difference in the amo~lnt
of air taken in per stroke or to a difference in the degree to which it is utilized.
I?igures 1 and
2 are presented, as a composite photograph, to show the magnitude of such variations under
the conditions noted.
Values of brake mean effective pressures used for computing indicated mean effwtivc
pressure on figure1 are from testson Liberty 12-cylinder aviation engines with 5.4, 5.6, and
7,2 compression ratios (altitude laboratory tests, hTos. 144, 147; 155, 156, 157, 159, and 160).
Similar values used on figure 2 are from tests on a Hispano-Suiza, model H, 300 h. p. engine
(Tests ITos. 161 and 162.) These engines were operated at
with compression ratio of 5.3.

The barometric pressure ranged from ground (75 cm.) to that corresponding
Hispano-Suiza.
Only wide-open throttle runs were used on figures 1 and
to about 25,000 feet altitude (3O cm.).
2. In all cases the fuel was an aviation gasoline -which meets the specifications of the Aircraft
Production Board for export to the American Expeditionary
Forces.’
The indicated mean effective pressure versus altitude curves of the two engines, figures 1
and 2, are not comparab~e above about 15,000 f cct (45 cm. barometer), because the Llherty
engine tests, except RTO.160, were made with special altitude adjustment on carburetor, whereas
the Hispano-Suiza tests were made to determine the engine performance when equipped with
stock carburetors -without special altitude adjustment.

this totaI friction was added to the obsemed brake mea~ effective pressure ai partiaIIy closed
throttle positions.
The density of the charge at the beginning of compression was approximated by computations based on the following premises: (1) The total weight of charge per cylinder is the
sum of the weights of air and of gasoline supplied per cycIe.
(2) The totaI -rolume of the
charge at the beginning of compression may be co~=idered as the total @rider
-roIume Iess the
volume occupied by the residual gases expanding from cIearanee volume and exhaus~ pressure
to the suction pressure.
(3) The density at the begiming
of compression is the weight of
charge per cylinder per cycle (1) di~icled by the ~oIume of charge per cylinder per cycle (2).
In detail, the assumptions made in order to compute the datz for pIotting figure 3 include
the folIowing:
(1) That the exhaust pressure in the cyhnder is atmospheric pressure.
(z) That the suction pre=~e
&side the cylkder, a or 6 on figure 4, is the pressure measured in the intake manifold close to the intake valves (actuaIIy this intake pressure as measured
has too great an absolute value and would lie abo~e the suction pressure on the card, thus
indicating a smaIIer lower loop than would be shown by an indicator).
(3 J That the exhaust gases Ming the clearance -rolume of the cylinder would expand
=
from the exhaust pressure to the suction pressure according to the reIaiion P T71”3C.
(4) That the corners of the lower loop card were sharp, as in figure 4, and not rounded as
they are in fact.
(This assumption gives too large an area for the ~ower loop; assumption 2
gi-i-es too small an area} so the errors tend to neutralize each other.)
(5) Thzt all of the fuel supplied was completely ~aporized at the beginning of compression.
The data used in studying the change of indicated mean eflecti~e pressure with de~ity
at the beginning of compression, shown on figure 3, were from a test (hTO.160) which ~cluded

prw.swe -with increase of cornprwsion ratio is expected because of greater ratio of expansion,
and a ~ossibIe improwment
in combustion.
A cmnparison of figures 1 and 2 show-s that fihe indicgted mean effective pressure of the
Hispano-%iza
engine is slightly greater than that of the Liberty, at the same air density and
compression ratio.
This is explained by the less amount of heating with the Hispano-Suiza
manifold jackets.
When the air suppIy is at O“ C. (32° F.) the manifold temperature of the
Hispano-%iza
is about – 10° C. (14° F.], -whiIe that of the Liberty is about + 5° G. (41” F.).
For a given temperature and a given pressure of air supply, the actuaI density of the air entering
the cylinders is reduced by heat~~, aIthough it is also increased by the cooling resulting from
the evaporation of the gasoIine.
~s~~ the manifoId density instead of the supply density, the
two engines gi~e the same mean effecti~e pressure for the same density.
Apparently the relation between indicated mean effecti~e pressure and air supply density
is based upon the fact thzt the chanam of indicated mean effective pressure is proportional to
the change of density of the charge at the beginning of compression, irrespective of whether
the density is changed by altitude or by throttling.

one method of rating engines is by the horsepower per cubic inch or Iiter of piston displacemeRt. This maybe somewhat rnideacling, as it is based on the voIume, not the weight, of charge.
The piston displacement of an engine is constant, but the weight of charge drawn in on the

The subject of -roIumetric efficiency is taken up in Part Y in connection with the effects of
change of air temperature upon engine performa~ce, but it is not out of pIace to consider it here, in

Returning to the subject of the indicated work from unit weight of air, tho density of tho
charge at the beginning of compression is a direci measure of the weight of air drawn irito each
cylinder at each suction stroke,
The usc of the weighfi of air per cyIinder pm cyclo avoids the
kdious computations which are incident to obtaining the charge density,
In tha ewnt that
on] y one engine is considered> Lhe process is further abbreviated by taking weight of air pm
revolution, which is a constant tirnes the weight per cylinder per cycle.
The points in figure 1 represent Lhe indicated work (ordinates) plotted verems the lvcight of
air (absciss~), or, more strictly, the foot-pounds of indicated work per cylinder pm cycle versus
the corresponding weight of air used per cylinder per cycle.
Figure 1 was plotted as a genmalizationj wing data from many tests of both the Liberty and the 13ispa.no-Suiza engines.
The tests plott~d include all of the several compression ratios previously mentioned, with the
engines operating at the several speeds, altitudes; mixture ratios, and thrott.lo position.
On
the whole, the points indicate a definite relation between the indicated work and the weight
of air supplied, although there is a considerable scattering.
The line shown as the curve is
really the center of a zone or band, and was located without reference to the points (circles)
representing the 7.2 compression data.
As there were many variables incluclcd in the tests shown in figure 1, data from one engine,
a I.iberty 12 with 5.4 compression,
was plotted on figuro 2, using coordinates proportional to
those- of f~gure 1. That is, the indicated mean effective pressure is used in place of tko footpounds of work per cylinder per cycic, and pounds of air clivide.d by r. p. m. are emplwycd as
equivalent to the weight of air per cylinder per c,yele. On figure 2 all the variables are [.]irninated except mixture rtit,ios and possibIe changes in the efficiency of combustion at diflcrcnt
densities.
Tho mixture ratio would be espected to have considerable influence upon tho work
obttiined from a pound of air (when mixed with gasoIine), hence the points where the data
would plot are marked by numerals which are the values of Lhe corresponding mixiurc rwtios,
On the tests pIotted in figure 2 the weight of air supplied per cycle was changed mainly by
alterations of the density through change of pressure, aIthough changes of speed from 1,200 to
ZJ()()o r. p. ~l. caused smaller changes in the air weight per cycle at such altitude, and on SOme
of the runs the engine was throttIed.
In the latter case the changes due to change in th lower
Ioop of the indicator diagram have been handled ‘as previously explained.
‘t’he indicated mean effective pressure is found to be nearl], but not quite, proportional to
the weight of air suppIied per cycle.
A reduction in the density of the air causes a sIightIy mom
than proportionate decrease in the mean effective pressure, especially at the smaller densitim,
The mixture proportions have considerable efiect upon the worli to be obtained from a pound
of air, other conditions being constant, and this subj cct of effect of mixture ratio is discussed
in another part of this report.
The speed of the engine has no effect, at least for the speed
range covered by the data on figure 2,
The explanation of the more rapid falling off of indicated bean effective pressure per pound
of air at the greater altitudes was not ob~ious.
It was suspected that this might bo duo to
Iess complete combustion at reduced densities.
Some few exhaust gas ana]yses had previously beeu made on a similar engine which was being tested in the altitude chamber,
Theso
analyses were examined to see if they showed an3?change in efficiency of combustion with change
of altitude.
The determinations of oxygen in the exhaust gas, as shown by theso analyws, are
plotted versus barometer on figure 3, and .a~parently indicate a greater amount of unco@ined
oxygen at, the higher altitudes.
In obtammg the sampIes of exhausfi gas reasonable precautions were taken to prevent air leaking in, since the result of a leak wouId be to increase tho
oxygen content of the sampIe as the pressure was reduced in the altitude chamber.
The excess
oxygen in the exhaust at altitude would also be a result of a decrease in the efficiency of comIhi.dence from recent tests with a constant mixture ratio hardly support the assumpbustion.

But, c-vcn so: it would

V. EFFECTS OF CHANGE OF TEMPER.4TURE
It is customary to supply hext to the mixture of air and gasoline in order to aid cmburction
and distribution, although this heating reduces the engine power at open thro ttk.
Heating
the air supply at constant pressure does not reduce power in proportion to change of air-supply
density.
It hms previously been shown that engine pbwer is proportional to air drmsity when
These apparently contradictory
facts led

to ~he work on which this chapter is based, involving the change of volumetric efficiency with
air temperature, and from which it is concluded that the engine power is directIy prop~mtional
(when conditions am normal) to the weight, m density, of the charge in the cylinder at the
beginning of compression.
The outline followed in studying the effects of varying -air temperatures was to first find
whether the air temperature affected the indicated work obtainable from unit weight of air or
of gasoline.
Under the conditions and withinthe limits of these tests no change was discovered.
Continuing the study, it wm. found that the volumetric efficiency increases as the air temperature
is increased.
perhaps it will be well to say that volumetric efficiency m used in this report is defined m

air temperatures.
One of the sugg:~tions arising from this work is that it maybe possib~e to breakup a hwvy
fuel by intense heating of the air, subsequently cooling the charge in order to minimize the loss
of power.
In testing in the altitude chamber, the air temperature is gencralIy rnaintaincd constant
for each and the same for all tests. However, there are tests in which the air supply tempcr~atum
was varied, using a Liberty 12-cylinder aviation engine with 7.2 compression ratio, runnin%

Another feature which should not be owrlooked when studying this subject is the existence
of what may be termed a critical temperature for each gasoline.
To explain this, i~ has been
found that “X” gadine
does not c=rburet well if the air supply is much cooler than the freezing
point of water.
Reports from sources outside of the Bureau of Stmuiarcls indicate that a temperature of at leash 15 or 20° C. (60 or 70” F.) is necessary to handle commercial gasoline.
The tests considered in this chapter are not below the “critical temperature” of the fuel used.

weight of charge is proport.iona~ to its density, and as heating the air does not decrease power
as fast as it does density, it follows that the air supply density is not proportio~al to the charge
densit~ inside the c@der.
Densit.v changes of charge, due to changes in temperature, and perhaps presmre, after the
air has entered the carburetor, may be espeeted to explain these cha~~es of volumetric efEciency.
Such changes in charge temperature will not be completed in the manifold, but wfl continue
inside the cylinder, and n-ill aIter the volumetric efiliciency until the intake vah-e is cIosed.
ManifoId temperatures and pressures indicate the direction and magnitude of the density
changes? although the information afforded by them is incomplete, in that the final conditions
inside the cylinder are unknown, except indirect@ by means of ~ohrmetric efficiency.
This
development is ihstrated
by figures 3 to 10, inclusi~e, is outlined in the foIlowing discussion,
and is based upon data from a Liberty engine of 7.2 compression ratio when conditions were as

730 C. (160° F.), except for three of the several runs at higher air temperatures when jacket
was varied, both above and beIow normal.
The manifold temperature, measured afi the intake mike (fig. 3] is higher than the air
suppIy temperature when the latter is below about —7° C. (-!- 20° F.), because the jackets are
giving more heat to the charge than is abstracted by e~aporation of gasoline.
With air suppIy
temperatures abo~e ttis the heat transfer from the jackets becomes Iess and Iess as the air
suppIy temperature approaches the jacket temperature, w-bile at the same time more and more
of the gasoIine evaporates in the manifold, withdrawing increasingly greaker quantities of heat.

supply density (b curves).
lf the density inside the cylinder were known, it is quite probable
thtit the indicated m. e. p. would be found to vary directly with the density at beginning of

Under the conditions of these tests the volumetric efficiency should be a measure
of the.

It was of interest to see how the indicated mean effective pressure would vary witth air

In order
to imitate this condition the actuaI indicated m. e. p. values afi the several air temperatures
were clivided by the c.ozresponding observed volumetric efficiencies, the results being shown by
crosses on figure 10. To make a comparison with the assumptio[l that power varies with density,

air temperatures were computed upon the assumption that m. e. p. varies directly with the
density, density being changed only by change of temperature.
The results me shown by
circles on figure 10 and they coincide with the points (crosses) from the observed data.
This
confirms the statement that a change of “temperature of entering air alters the power of t-m
engine only as it changes the density of the charge at the beginning of compression, provided
that the fuel is properly vaporized or pulverized at the time of ignition.
But the recIuction of
power is not directly proportional to the increase of absolute temperature of the entering air
because at the same time there is a reduction of heat transfer from the surrounding media and
also a greater cooling effect because more of the fuel is vaporized before the intake valve closes.
The extent of these hTo modifying factors is determined by the design of the engine, the conditions of operation, and the nature of the fueI empIoyed.
There can be no formula of universal application “%vhichwill convert the engine power or

VI. EFFECTS OF CHANGE OF MIXTURE RATIO.
The subject of mixture ratios is receiving consi&wabIe attention at the present time. Thr

power and economy.
The effect of-change of altitude and compression ratio upon the proportion of air and fuel
for, say, maximum power is not definitely known.
It is possible that Lho proportion giving
maximum economy at the ground may not be the same as that giving maximum economy at
another altitude, or with another compression ratio, or at another throttle position.
The same
statement applies to the mixture for maximum power.
If altitude and comprtwsion ratio
change the required proportion for a desired result, such change may be explained by the efle cts
of changed density and heat content of the charge at the time of qgnition upon the process of

tests, at speeds from 1,200 to 2,200 r. p. m., still it is possibIe that the reIation of the velocity
of flame to piston travel may have some influence upon power.
This subject of mixture ratio involves the question of how much energy is li’oeratd by
the combustion of the fuel under the several conditions,

possible difference between the actual mixture ratio, defined as the measurwl air to mcasun.xl
gasoline, and the effective mixture ratio, defined as the proportions of air and gasoline actually
combining inside the cylinder.
At the present time data are being obtained in the altitude chamber upon tho cflccts of
change of mixture ratio, but among the oIder tests there are only a few with much rango of
mixture, as most of the runs were made with the carburetor adjusted for the hwt economy
consistent with the condition of maximum power.
However, the tests upon tho 7.2 compression engine also included runs with the rnkture purposely mado considerably leaner than Lkc
maximum power acljustment, and some runs on the engines with about 5.4 compression aIso
included rich mixtures as wcl.1 as maximum power mixtures.
A general survey was made of the data from practically all of the older tesis, using basic
relationships.
By basic is meant the fundamental relations betwwm mixture ratio ond the
indicated work resulting from unit weight of (1) gasoline and (2) air supplied.
TIw use of
indicated instead of brake work placed the data from all the engines on a moro compmwble
basis and removed some inconsistencies resulting from variations of volumetric cfllcicncy.
The results of the general survey indicated that the work obtainable from unit wcigh~ of gasoline steadily increased as the mixture was made leaner until the ratio was about 18 or 20 to 1,
when the engine performance became erratic, probably due to misfiring.
This erratic behavior
did not ahvays begin at the same mixture ratio for the various altitudes, compressions, etc.
The survey also indicated that the work obtainable from unit weight of air followed tho f mm
into which the usual curves of power versus ratio would convert; that is, the maximum power
is obtained from unit weight of air with a mixture perhaps slightly richer than tho thcoret.ical
combining proportion of 15 weights of air to 1 of gasoline.
Chided by these general relations, data were selected so as to segregate the various wwiablcs
as much as possible, still retaining comparable tests with varying mixtures.
These am shown
in figures 1 and 2, plotted to the coordinates previously mentio~ed, namely, mixture. rdio
as abscissn for both plots, and ordinates of indicated work per pound of gasolil~e for flgurc 1
and per pound of air for figure 2. One plott or section of figure I is made with data from a
Liberty engine with 7,2 compression, another from a Liberty with 5.4 compression, and tho
third from a Hispano-Suiza
300-horsepower engine with 5.3 compression.
All of the plots
of figure 2 are from a Libe~t3~ 7.2 compression engine, at different times and different altitudes.
In order to reach absolute conclusions it wiIl be necessary to cover Lhe whole rango of mixture
ratios at each compression} as this is a major factor.
It is evident that altitude is also a
factor, probably of minor importance, and that speed changes of the magnitude of from 1,200

VII, 13EATBALANCES.
The heat balance of an engine shows the disposition made of the energy supplied, and is a
vaIuable aid in making impro~ements in engine pmformance.
The data obtained in the a.ltitude Laboratory permit accounting for most of the energy supplied, a.~ih is exceptiordy
comple~e
in all respects. In this section a comparison has been made between the heat bfilauco obtained
from actual engine tests and that computed by thermodynamics from the corresponding theoretical cycle, indicating that the greatest possible improvement in thermal eflkiency can be
made by increasing the compression ratio.
A major portion of the potential energy suppIied is ‘actualIy made availabie to the engine
by the chemical process of combustion, but not all, as some of the elements or compounds
usually escape uncombined.
And unburned fuel in the eshaust maybe of a different chomica]
nature from that supplied, in which case chemical changes represent energy changes.
I?or
exampIe, if the exhaust contains carbon monoxide,
aIcohols, or ald&ydes,
they roprcsmi
chemical changes and also energy losses.
The thermal effic.ien~y of an engine is usually computed as the actual Worlidividcrly the

bustion and the losses
due to incomplete transformation
from heat energy to work, l~or purposes of analysis of engine performance it would be well to separate the efficiency of combustion from the efficiency of transformation of the energy actually made availablo to -the mwhanism, the former probably varying more with change of operating conditions than dots the lattw.
One method of approximating the efficiency of combustion is by wsuming that all tho heat
made available by combustion’ appears in the total heat accounted for during an engino tcs~.
In these tests the energy accounted for is in (1) the brake power, (2) the cihaust heat, and

is the useful result obtained from the engine and needs no comment.
(2) .The exhaust heat
was measured by water cooIing the exhaust gases to their original temperature and pressure,
and measuring the heat thus absorbed.
Therefore, the exhaust heat does not iucludo any loss
due to inefficiency of combustion, as it is made up entirely of the sensible heat of all the products
of combustion, togetherwith the latentand superheatof the water Yapor. (3) The jacket,
losses were obtained from the quantity and the temperature rise of the cooling water.
The
heat thus represented includes that taken directly from the combustion, from compression,
and from piston friction.
As a great part of’ the friction loss is due to piston friction, a large
portion of the friction will appear as heat in the j acket water. It should be noted that t,ho sum
of brake thermal efficiency, jacket, exhaust, and radiation is 100 per cent of the hoa~ made
available,nd that if indicated is substituted for brake thermal efficiency in ok taining the heat

heat losses from the engine system by conduction, convection, and radiation.

made a-railable by combustion.
If unburned fueI is included, the 10SSOS
are, called “residual
heat,”
The energy accounted for in exhaust, jacket, and brake (an approximation
of tho heat
made available by combustion) is used as a basis for computing heat balances in this chaptm,
as well as the usual basis of ‘(heat” supplied in the fuel. Both types of heat ba.laneo wore

Tables 1 and 2 present the items of the heat bahmces computed upon the two bases prwiously mentioned, i. e., per cents of heat supplied in gasoIine and of heat accounted for in exhaust,
jacket, and brake. The last cok.mm of Table 1 is an estimate of the quantity of heat remo-red
in the lubricating oiI on the Liberty engine, obtained by noting the temperature rise of the
oil from irdet to outlet during the test, and subsequently deter mining the rate of flow of the oil
at ~arious engine speeds.
Less than one-half of 1 per cent of the heat supplied is remo~ed by
cooling the oil.
Exhaust heat and indicated horsepower, as per cent of heat. accounted for, taken from
Tables 1 and ?, are plot&l zgainst air density (at constant temperature) on the upper section
of tlgure 1. D~ta from the Liberty en=tie are denoted by circks, and that from the HispanoSuiza enntie by crosses.
In the preliminary pIotting of data with these same coordinates it
had been found that there was no systematic variation with speed, so the different peeds

and speeds. This agreement betw-een theory and test results Ied to the ta.buIation of data from
tests of enaties -with se-reral diflerent compression ratios, includ@
some of the fist tests made
in the aItitude chamber.
Heat balaqces as computed from these tests with severaI different
compressions are gi-ren in Table 3, wherein the items are as foIlows:
EJB is the sum of the heat accounted for in the e.xhamst, jacket, and brake, expressed
as per cent of the heat supplied in gasoline.
E is the heat rejected in e.xhanst, expressed as per cent of heat accounted for in
exhaust, jacket, and brake.
J is the heat removed in jacket water, expressed as per cent of heafi accounted for.
B is the brake or dynamometer horsepower, express+d as per cent of heat accounted
for.
As friction determinations were not complete on some of the older tests because of Iack of
power, so the indicated thermal efliciemies are not gi-wn for &is group of tests. ln tabulating
the data for Table 3, a speed common to all tests was sought, but some of the tests were made
