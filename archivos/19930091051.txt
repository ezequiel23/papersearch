(1) The subcommittee on aircraft design and associated engineering problems deals with
the general aerodynamic problems of flight, and with the fundamental problems of the design
of structures suited to realizo the various requirements of the particular service required. To
assist in its work subcommittees on steel construction for aircraft find fireproof co,erings for
aircraft have been organized.
~) The subcom mittee on navigation of aircraft, aeronautic instruments. and accesso ri es
,
deals wi th probloms relating to instruments and accessories required for the operation and
na\~igation of aircraft in general, and further with reference to special types of military or
general service.
(3) The subcommittee on power plants for aircraft deals with problems relating to the
power plant as a whole, and with its various immediate attachments and accessories, including
fuels and lubrica.ting oil. To assist in its work it has organized under it two subcommittees
dealing specifically with the following subjects:
(a) Fuel injection engines.
(b) Radiators for aircraft engines.

(4) The subcommititee on stiandardizatiion and investiigation of materials deals primarily
witih the physicol properties of the materials of engineering construction, with special reference
to their adoption and use in aircraft constiruction . To assist in its work it has organized a
subcommi ttee on light olloys, to deal specifically with oluminum Itnd its light alloys.
COORDINATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND RESEARCH WORK.

By virtue of the close contact with military and naval needs afforded by the appointment
of representative officers of the Army and Navy on the various subcommittees, and also by
virtue of direct military and naval representation on the executive committee, the scientific
and research \vork in aeronautics undertaken by the Army, the Navy, the Bureau of Standards,
and this committee, has been coordinated. The results obtained have been promptly brought
to the attention of oll agencies interested and unnecessary duplication of efforti has been reduced
to a minimum.
The Director of the Bureau of Standards has placed the facilities, personnel, and equipment of the bureau at the service of the committee, and has r equested the committee, through
direct advice, and through the immediate agency of its various subcommittees to supervise
and direct the research and investiigational work on aircraft problems, carried on at the Bureau
of Standards for the War and Navy Departments and the committee.
ACTIVITIES OF THE TECHNICAL SUBCOMMITTEES.

The activitiies of the subcommittees engaged on scientific and research problems and the
programs for the further study of these problems are describ ed as follows:
AIRCRAIT DESIGN AND ASSOCI ATED ENG INEERING PRODLEMS.

During the past year the work of the subcommittee on aircmft design and associated
engineering problems has, in the main, consisted of1. Investigation of designs for aircraft submitted to the co!Uffi.ittee.
2. Theoretical investigations.
3. Study of types of propellers.
1. Numerous designs of both airplanes and airships have been submitted to the committee. These have oll been studied with care. In some cases special committees have been
formed, with the cooperation of the military authorities, for the purpose of a m ore complete
investigation.
In not a few cases features have been observed which called for furLh er scientific research,
and the committee has arranged for the necessary experim ents in some of the existi ng aerodynamic laboratories, generally at the Bureau of Standards. Among these investigatiolls the
most important one, which is still in progress, is probably that of airplanes having w1ngs
arranged in tandem.
2. Severnl theoretical investigations have been undertaken . The most important of
these are(a) The Study of the Laws of Air Resistance of Aero[oils, by George de Bothezat. (:See
Technicol Report No. 28.)
(b) Theory of an Airplane EncoUllwring Gusts, Part III, by P rof. E. B. Wilson. (ee
Technical Report No. 27 .)
(c) The Design of Wind Tunnels find Wind Tunnel Propellers, by E. P . Warner and F. II.
Norton.
(d) Analysis of Fuselage Stresses, by E. P. Warner and R. G. l",fiUer.
3. The study of types of propellers has been continued at the aerodYlI!lmi co.llaboratory of
Leland Stanford Junior University. The labora tory itself and the results obtained in 1917 lire
doscribed in tho third annual repo r t. The work of the present year hns consisted in tho investigation of many new types suggested, in the main, by the military authorities.
Before stating the program of work f or the coming year it may be well to outline the scope
of activities of the committee as conceived by its chairman and members. This mlty properly
be subdi vided iuto five groups of investigations: (1) Propellers; (2) norofoils, or elementul'J

supporting and controlling surfaces; (3) combinations of supporting and controlling surfaces;
(4) reaction between the airplane and the propeller system; (5) structure. Under division I
the principal problems are as follows:
(a) Model experiments: (1) On propeller models (single or multiple) undisturbed by reaction with adjacent structuros.
(2) On propeller models (single or multiple) set up with corresponding models of adjacent
and interfering structures.
(b) Free flight tests on full size propellers with special reference to the preceding experiments.
(c) Analytical investigation of propellers in accordance with theories developed by
Drzewiecki, De Bothezat, and others, and with special reference to development of relations
between the results found by such methods and those furnished by direct test, either on models
or on full-size forms.
(d) Examination and ano.Iysis of existing experimental results on propeller models with a
view to classification and reduction to uniform units and modes of representation.
Under division 2 the principal problems are as follows :
(a) Examination and analysis of existing experimental results on aerofoil aIld supportillg
or control surfaces with a view to classification and reduction to uniform units and modes of
representation.
(b) Search for forms of aerofoil or supporting and control surfaces with special characteristics, as, for example, the minimum shift of center of pressure with change in angle of attack.
This involves both theoretical and experimental study.
Under division 3 the principal problems are as follows:
(a) Study of combinations of supporting surfaces with a VIOW to the determination of
mutual reaction and interference.
(b) Study of combinations of supporting and of control surfaces with a view to the determination of the most effective methods of steering and of control generally, jncluding stability
under various conditions of ilight.
Under division 4 the principal problems are 118 follows:
(a) The mutual reaction between a single propeller (tractor or pusher) and the adjacent
structuros of the plane (fuselage, nacelle, control surfaces).
(b) The mutual reaction between two tandem propellers and between such a pair of propellers and the adjacent plane structures (nacelle, fuselage, control surfaces).
Under division 5 the principal problems center around a study of the methods of design best
suit~d to meot the needs of aeronautic construction and having in viow:
(a) The a,ailable materials of engineering construction.
(b) Tho spocial requirements of aircraft structures.
Under these various problems those which. correspond most nearly to the present rosources
of the committeo, both in personnel and in laboratory equipment, are those in the first four
groups; and of thesc tho problems of more immediate importance seom to be the followin g:
Ia (II ), lb, I e, ld; 20., 3a, 4a; 4b .
In the dotermination of precedence, howe'/er, judgmcnt has beon constantly exorcised,
having in view the appli cation of the problom to war co nditions, and the o.vailable reso urcoo of
tho committee.
With tho opening of tbe laboratory at Langley Field and the complotion of the new wind
tunn el ill connection with it, the work of the committee will bo greatly facilitated.
KAVIGATlO;-.1 OF AIHCIUFT. AEHONA UT IC INSTRUMENTS. AND ACCESSOH I ES.

A subcommittee on navigation of aircraft, aeronautic instruments, and accessories was
formed in order to aid in the development of airplane instruments; but inasmuch as thero were

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

During the past year the activity of the committee may be considored under three heads:
I. Improvements in existing instruments.-Owing to the fa ct that the aviation officors of the
Army and Navy have to a large degree handled thoir probloms in thoir own organizations, it
has beon only in rare cases that it was necessary to condu ct independ~nt investigations looking
to the improvement of existing instruments. Tho method followed has been to learn from the
military authorities the nature of the defects found to exist in the standard instruments furnished the airplanes; then to ascertain if investigations were being made to remedy these
defects. In those cases where additional researches were necessary, proper steps have been
taken to see that these were made at the Bureau of Standards, the resources of which were
placed at the disposal of the committee by its director.
2. New instruments.-Constant efforts have been made to obtain information concerning
the airplane instruments developed in foreign countries, and ih a number of cases actual instruments have been obtained. These have been tested, and the results, if favorabl e, havo been
transmitted to the proper military authorities.
Continuous correspondence has been' carried on with French and British exports and
investigators in order to keep in touch with developments in Europe, especially with reforence
to long-distance operations.
3. T.he great number of inventions and suggestions which arc received by the office of the
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics are carefully scrutinized; and in case any promising device or method is noted, care is taken to further its development. When it is perfected,
or its usefulness demonstrated, it is called to the attention of the military authorities.
The great defect in the proper conduct of the obvious work of the committee at the present
time is the lack of facilities for testing instruments in actual flight and for learning from the
aviators themselves the facts about the instruments. For the committ~e to work to advantage
it will be necessary for it to have a laboratory for instruments directly attached to an aviation
field and to enjoy certain obvious privileges in connection with the latter. This matter will be
settled satisfactorily when the laboratory, workshop, and wind tunnel are opened at Langley
Field, for the hearty cooperation of the Division of Military Aeronautics is assured.
The program for the following year will be largely a continuation of that for the prosont
year, viz:
1. Investigations will be undertaken aimed to improve the standard instrumonts which
prove unsatisfactory.
2. EITorts will be made to develop new instruments to meet needs as they arise or as they
may be foreseen.
3. As soon as proper facilities are provided at Langley Field an independent investigation
will be begun as to proper standards and specifications for airplane instruments of all types.
During the current year there has been no allotment of funds to carryon the work of t.ho
committee, but in the near future it will be necessary to provide for the salaries of two or mor('
technical assistants and for construction work in the shops.
pOWFa PLANTS FOil AIRCRAFT.

1 cw types oj aviation engines.-A special subcommittee known as the fuel injection engino
\
committee was appointed to investigate the possibilities of developing an aircraft engino embodying features of tho Diesel or Junkers-Diesel oil engines . Some progress was made in the desigu of
such au engine, aud the committee has cooperated with a private compt1.ny which is dovelopillg
a silllplifled form of Junkers engine for a somewhat diiIerent purpose . Tho possibilitie::! inhort)nt
in this type of ongine appear so prorrtising that it is planned to co ntinu e the work on tilis
problem.
A novel form of scavenging two-cycle engine was brought to the atLont.ion of the committoo
,early ill the year and appeared so promising that the Clarko Thomson Research was interos({ld
in the problem of its development. A standard aircraft engine was altered t~ suit the principlos
involved . The results of experimentation and test, however, indicated that the inherent diLlicultios were too groat to justify continuation of the development in tho fa ce of the more irupor-

tant problems then requiring prompt attention. It is planned to again resume this investigation
in the near future, as the possible results are of great interest.
S'Il,perch(J.rging to maintain power at aUit1wc.- The committee has kept in close touch with
the several forms of apparatus which are being developed for this purpose. Early in the year
a co mprehensive survey was made of the various possible means for maintaining the charge
density, Ilnd it was concluded that all but one of the promising typos woro under satisfactory
development and that the committee could bost oxpedite the final solution by insuring that the
one remaining intoresting type was made tho subject of intensive dovelopment. Therefore the
Cln.rke Thomson Rosearch was requested to undertake the problem of supercharging by moans
of the genr-dri ven positive blowor of the Roots type. Test results are not yet available. It is
the intention to maintain ·close cognizance of 1111 forms of supercharging development and to
insure that the true value of eve'ry promising means shall be detorminod.
[mprovemen.t of engine deta.ils.-Inasmuch as the life of most aeronautic engines depends
to a large extent upon the maintenance of the exhaust valves in a proper working condition
and that the principal reason for the rapid deterioro.tion of such valves in Lbe high tempera·./,ure at which they have to operat.e, it is readily seen that the adequate control of the temp ernture rise of 'exhaust-valve heads constitutes a major problem. The possibilities of several
suggested remedies for this trouble have been studied and experim ents have been conducted
with valves of various designs and materials. It is proposed to continue this investigation
wit.h a ,iew to determining the best means for insuring the maximum life of such parts.
The problem of suppressing the noise of the exhaust has been studied and mnch experimental work performed in the endeavor to devise a satisfactory form of mufIler for aircraft
engines. Very encouraging results have been obtained with a newly developed vortex type
of silencer.
Rad'w tion improvement.-A very comprehensive study of lhe characterislics of all available types of radiator-cell construction has been made in three different types of wind tunnels.
Experimental work has been completed and results analyzed to the end .that the underlying
principles of radiator design have been established . In practice the problem is fundamentally
one of minimizing the power cost of unit radiation, and this investigation has resulted in severnl reports which contain especially valuable engi neering data. The effect of radiator location on t.he airplane and of different forms of radiator h ousing have also been studied , with
some rathcr remarkable results. It is proposed to check the lab oratory data by various free
night tests and also to make an additionllllnbol'atorr study at such points as lhe effect of cel l
size, dimcnsions, and nature of surface on the rate of heat transfer.
Carburetor imlJro'Vl'ment.-_\. st.udy has been made of the performance of several different
types of u(,l'ontlutic carburetors as mounted upon an engine in the altitude chamber. At the
Sllmc time, th ese and other types have been 8tudied \\-ith the aid of a special testing equipment
whi ch permit ted duplication of tho pressure and temperature eondit.ions en co unt ered at all
flying alt.itud es. Special attention has been given to the study and evaluation of lhe several

stress of the past year to develop methods or. apparatus f.or the measurement of the quantltles
involved. It is pr~posed, however, to pursue ' thiS investigation as rapidly as may be possible.
Ignition improvement.- Methods have been developed for the mechanical and elec(,rical
tes ting of those components of the ignition system which had not previously received ad equat.e
treatment. 'Tho spark plug in particular has been made the subject of exhaustive research
as to its design, materials, and operation chal'llcteristics. An extensive inves tigation has been
conducted on the effect of high temperatures upon the mechanical and electrical properties of
various ceramic and other materials which could be used for insulators. As tho result of a most
careful survey of the entire field of ceramic materials, in which a very large number of new porcelains were inade and tested, a special porcelain has been developed for spark-plug insulators
which is markedly superior to any that has heretofore been produced, either in this country or
abroad. The electri cal, thermal, and mechanical st.rength of this material so far surpasses that
of the best previously available as to make this discovery one of the greatest possible importance .
The several causes of failure in spark plugs have been investigated, according to their relative importance, and temperature measurements have been made to determine the effect of
different.materials in the spark-plug shells
Studies have been made of the effect of changes of pressure and temperature upon the
voltage necessary to insure spari~ing. A method has been developed for measuring the heat
energy of ignition sparks and corresponding tcsts have been made upon a number of igllition
systems. At the same time the character of the electrical discharge has received much attention as has also the problem of determining magneto characteristics. The effect of the external
spark gap, and the correct design of such accessory has been made the subject of considerable
study with a vi ew to determining the best design for a simplified form which would render
unn ecessary any manual adjustment, in order to secure the correct electrical characteristics
und er varying conditions . The problem of · determining the most effective form of electrical
discharge for securing the greatest rapidity of ignition and flame. propagation is to be further
studied as are those other problems which have been mentioned above.
Fuels and combustion.-An exceptionally compl ete program of invesLigation has been completed on the performance characteristics of a considerable number of gasolincs and other
hydrocarbon fu els as d ev~loped under conditions appro.a~hing those obtained in acLual flying,
but which were secured by means of the altitude chamber. Wbile the r esults of this extend ed
in vestigatio n are largely of a negative nature, th ey hnve nevertheless been of the grentest im por t.ance ill the set.tling of many qu estions in vol ving supp osed ad van t.ages for fu els of extrllordinary specifi ca ti ons or compositions. Howe\' er, cer tnin fu el mixtures and c.hemi cally alt ercd
fuels have sho wll extremely deSIrable characteristics, largely by way of permitt.ing greatly
increased compression pressures aud therefore increased power out.put. amI Lh ermal efficiency.
An engine hilS been equipp ed with a new form of apparatus whi ch will enable the determination of absolute vulu es of the rate of flame propagation. It is also expected thut it will be
possible to meas ure the rate of co mbustion. It is proposed that thi s Itppafl1t.us shall furni sh

can be used in cOIUloc tion with flame-propagation m easurements in tho study of the phonomena
which occur in the cylinder oCthe mod em aircraft engine. This work is of great importance
as determining the direction · for the expenditure of effort in th e furth er development of this
type of prime mover, and it is intend cd to carry it on as" rapidly as possible.
Lubrication anrl lubricants.-A preliminary study hIlS been made of effect of varying oil
compositions upon the power output, efficiency, and opern.ting ch aracteristics of nircrnft engines ns far as could be determin ed by tbe ordinary methods of conducting such tesLs. Tbe
effect of tho mixture of different forms of gro.phite with the oil has !lIso been studied. These
trsts were what might be cnlled service tests, in nsmuch us !?enrice engines were used and opcro.ted
under full load condit!ons on the torque stand, samples of the oil being obtain ed at regular intervals and the change in quality noted, as well as the operating ch r actcristics of L engine.
he
A special single cylinder aircraft engine has been fitted with means for measuring the
.pressures and temperatures existing in the oil films at all of the important bearing points.
th is equipment will provid e original d ata of a character which hns not h eretofor e been obtainnble, and it is believed that the very complete knowledge thus secured of the actual co nditions
. in the oil film will enable a much more accurate determination of the properties required in
oils for nircraft engine lubrication.
A compreh ensive laboratory stu dy is being made of the fundam ental properties of lulll'icants and new kinds of tests have been discovered which throw mu ch light upon the complicated
relations existing between the various physical and ch emical properties of lubricants.
It is proposea to cont.inu e all of the above phases of this invest.igation, as much of the work
is of a fund ament.a.l nature and the results will be of the greatest imp or tance to other fields of
lu brication as well ns that of the high duty in ternal comb usti on engin e.
Steam a1~1'craft potc('r pZal'lts.-Although the steftm engine was very popular during the
yery early attempts to solve the problem of mechanical fli ght, the r emarkable development of
the internal combustion engin e has so greatly surpassed that of the steam power plant that it
had been impossible for the latter to approach the resul ts obtained by the' gasoline engine for
the propu lsion of aircraft, either from the standpoint of weight per horsepower output or thermal
efficiency. At the present time, however, it is the belief of many aeronautic engineers that a
large propor tlOn of the fu ture corrunercial aircraft will b e of much gr eater size than have so far
oeen constructed. In the larger of present day long-distance bombing airplanes the total
power capacity approximates 2,000 horsepower . If steam po wer has any chance at all , in
competition with the internal-combustion engine, It must be in units of large sizo. Owing to
Lhe long and expensive development through whi ch the steam pla n t must pass and to the comparltt.iycly recent advent of the successful very large airplane it was im poss ible to undertake
allY comprehensive inv estig~ation of the problem durin~ the year H118. However, it is felt
that the subj ect. is well worthy of the most serious consideratIOn during the immediate fu ture
and it is the intention to institute such laboratory and ex,p erim entnl activities as will serve to
dl'tcrmine the f undamenta ls required for successful steam-p ower plants for aircraft.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVIS ORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The program for the future utilization of the altitud e laboratory includes, in addition to
the work previously indicated, a study of the uniformity of mixture distribution in inlet manifolds of various types, a study of the effect of different compression ratios in connection with
special fuels, tests, and development of supercharging devices, and analysis of a performance of
different types of aircraft engines.
STANDARDIZATION AND lNVFSTIGATION OF MATERIALS fOR AIRCR AFT.

During the past year the activities of the subcommittee on standardization and investigation of materials for aircraft have been mainly conducted at the Bureau of Standards, and all
experimental work on this subject done at the Bureau of Standards has been under the direction of this subcommittee. The following is a brief description of the more importan t work
on this 'suhject done at the Bureau of Standards during the past year :
(a) Airplane wing beams.-Tests have been made on solid beams of various woods with a
view to determining their r elative fitness for use as airplane wing spars. The possibility of
using laminated beams has also been investigated. The use of built-up members will result
in the elimination of much of the waste du e to the necessary r ejection of much solid stock.
Various splices have been tried and recommendations made regarding the most successful
types. The results of these tests are given in Technical Report No. 35. Further beam tests
will be made on special apparatus for transverse and axial loading, thus eliminat ing expensive
sand testing.
(b) Wing ribs and wing coverings.-Tests of wing ribs and wing coverings of metal and
other materials are in progress, with the object of developing fireproof wings of lighter weight
than the standard wing of fabri c and wood.
(c) Impact tests.- An investigation is being made by means of impact tests of the effect of
shocks on woods used in airplane construction. This method of testing woods for airplane
use has been given but small consideration hitherto, and the data Will no doubt be of conSiderable value.
(d) Variable camber wing.-A. variable camber wing is being developed and tests on ribll
designed for use in such a wing have given promising results.
STEEL CONSTRUCTION FOR A.IRCRAFT.

The substitution of steel, or other metal, for spruce in airplan e wing construct.ion has been
carefully conSidered both theoretically and practically.
Theoretical and experimental work was done at the Bureau of Standards, under the direction of Mr. J ohn H. Nelson, by Mr. H. L. Wh ittemore, to whom should be cred ited the
conclusions reached by the committee. Th e committee also curried on extensi'Ve in,cstigations with the cooperation of the Empire Art Metal Co. at its factory ilt College Point, N. Y.
This resulted in the construction of two complete sets of metal wings which have been
tested at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio . These ".-jngs consisted of steel ribs and aluminumalloy beams, the ailerons being entirely of steel.
These ",jngs proved satisfactory und er test both in flight and under load, so it is evidont
thut a similar metal construction can be produced which will huve the sllme strength as wood
for equal weight.
A complete technical reco rd of the experimental work on this most important subject is
on tile in the office of tbe committee, and the committee is at present encouraging developmont
along several lines by various manufacturers.
YIlEE FLIGHT TESTS.

Th e geneml purposo of the work of th e subcommittee 011 froe [light tests is to obtain ns
complete tests as possible of the performance, in all respects, of ai rplanes while in the air under
normal conditions . The general purpose of these tests is to supplement Ilnd make mo re valuable
the information gained from all sorts of tests 011 tho ground, including tests of engines ftnd
tests of airplane parts and airplane modols in wind tunnels. It is obvious that the act.unl
performance in tho air, when it becomes known, is the best possible basis for futur e progress .

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE Fon AERONAUTICS.

The committee now has, in a late stage of development, instruments [or rocording in tho
air the torque and revolutions per minute of tho engine, the thrust of tho propeller, the air
speed, the angle of attack, and the inclination of the wing chord to the true horizon. It is
proposed to complete this development as promptly as possible, and to get these instcL "" mts
in action itt the air, presumably on a D. H. 4 airplane, to determine the power-plant performance
and the relations in the air between the lift, drag, air speed, and angle of attack.
When such tests have been successfully demonstrated as possible, by making them, the
next stops on the program of the committee are to analyze the results and show what conclusions
can be drawn [rom them.
The committee then proposes, in due time, to extend the free-flight tests to such quantities
as will help to develop. ~he stability characteristics of airplanes, possibly to furnish some information as to the structure of air, and also possibly to furnish information as to the stresses in
various parts of an airplane in operation.
To secure the necessary degree of accuracy and reliability in the free-flight observations,
the new instruments have in each case been so designed as to give a continuous autographic
record.
RELATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO AERONAUTICS.

The functions o[ the subcommittee on the relation of the atmosphere to aeronautics fire
as follows:
(1) To advise in regard to those properties, characteristics, currents, winds, and the detailed
meteorological conditions o[ the free air which are of special importance to aeronautics and the
safety and economy of aerial navigation.
(2) To encourage the systematic investigation and observation, by Dleans of k-ites, pilot
balloons, airplanes, etc., of atmospheric phenomena; and through the agency of the Weather
Bureau and otherwise to provide for the general dissemination of advices based upon obserred
atmospheric conditions, and to assist in the applicat.ion of the results of investigations to the
problems of aerial navigation.
'The major activities of the subcommittee on the relation of the atmosphere to aeronautics
have been confined to the program of work conducted by the Weather Bureau in observations
and investigations of free-air conditions.
Provisions [or the extension of this work were made by Congress in an item in the Army
bill [or the fiscal year ended June 30, 1918, which reads as follows: .
For the e>tablishment and mainterulOce by the Weather Bureau of additional aerol ogical stations for observing,
measuring, and investigating atmospheric phenomeua in aid of aeronautics, including salaries, travel, and other expenses in the city of Washi.ngton and elsewhere, $100,000, to be expended und er the direction of the Secretary of
J.gri cu l tu reo

Prior to this tim e the Weather Bureau for a number of years had conducted fr eo-air ObSerYiltiOllS at Mount Weather and more recently at a central station at Drexel, ebr. Under the
above act, additional aerologicn.l stations were established at Broken Arrow, Okln.., Ellendalo,
T. Duk., Groesbeck, Tex., Leesburg, Gn.., and Royal Center, Ind.
This distribution is as
flworabl e as possible with the limited number of stn.tions to secure observations of fr ee-Iu r
conditions over a large portion of tbe country. Installation of equipment hilS been co mpl eted
n.t the Ellendale station, and free-air observations were begun in Decemb er, 1917.
:'-fuch delay hRs been experi enced in securing the equipm ent requ ired for these stations,
this equipment including special motor-driven kite-reeling apparatus instulled in a shelter
mounted on n. circular trflGk somewhat after the fashi on of obsen -atory domes of small
dimensions. N everthclcss, encouragi ng progress bas been mn.de, and at the prcscn t date obser'-ations a.rc actua.lly being made at the stations at Drexel, Ellendale, and Royal Cellter . Hand

At Drexel, lin ·addition 'to .the ·daily flights;'series:Qf observations covering 'a' period of R.bout:30
hours have been made whenever :conditions ·w ere favorable. The data 'thus obtainod onable
the Weather Bureau 'to follow in 'considerable detail the diurnal :changes 'at 'differont altitudes .
In all, 478 observations have been made from ,July .1,1'917, to June ·30, 1918. <DC those, 134
were made in ·18 different series, the remaining · 344 being ma.de · as daily observations. Tho
average altitude r eached in all flights 'was 'about 3,000 meters. At Ellendale 163 flights wore
made from December 17,1917, to June 30, '1918, the mean altitude being about 2,400 met.ors.
Publications.-Continuing the regular practice of the Weather Bureau, the data collocted
from the aerological stations are published as promptly as possible in the form of quarto supplements to the Monthly Weather Review. · :At the present date these comprise seven, namoly,
Aerology, Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, and include data from Drexel and Ellenda.le up to MA.rch, 1-918 .
The data for April to June, 1918, arc at the printer's, and still more recent data A.re now nearly
ready for the printer.
In its purpose to render the greatest possible assistance in the vigorous and successful
prosecution of the war, the Weather Bureau has cooperated with various branches of t.hc
United States Army in the following ways:
1. Papers on "Meteorology 'and aeronautics," "Mean values of free-air bnrometri c nnd
vapor pressures, temperatures, and densities over the United States," and "The turning of
winds with altitude" were .prepared and .published and copies have been furni shed for the
information and use of the aviation 'and 'artillery services.
2. Numerous requests have been made upon the Aerological Section of the Weather Bureau
for specific information relative to atmospheric conditions ill connection wi th aviation,
artillery problems, and for other purposes, both in the Uni ted Sta tes and in Europe.
3. Instrumental equipment, including kite meteorographs, has been supplied for the use of
the American Expeditionary Forces, ·the British Admiralty, etc. Assistance has been extendod
to the subcommittee on free-flight tests in supplying from-the instrument shops of the Weather
Bureau 'certain mounted elock movements for recording instruments needod in thoso tests,
including the loan of a special pair of r ecording theodolites.
4. In connection with special experimental tests temporary field stations han becn established and kite flights made at Ellington Field, Tex., Potomac Park, Washington, D. C., tlnd
Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Md.
.
In order to permit of flying kites withou t interference in a,ia bOIl work it bas been necessn ry
to locate the aerological stations of the Weather Bureau elsewhere than in the imm ed iat.e ,~icinit)·
of aviation camps. In order; however, to provide for the local needs of a,ia tion ano other
mili tary requirements, cooperation with the metcorological sec tion of Lhe Signal Corps hIlS resullt'd
in the establishment of about 25 meteorological and pilot balloon stations at properly se1rcted
military camps. The work at these stations under military direction consists chiefly of obscr,ntions of surface meteorological conditions, accompani ed by theodolite obser,ations of th e
flight of small rubber hydrogen -inflated pilot balloons . The obse n'a tio ns with such btlllooll~,
wh en properly redu ced, give thf-l path of th e balloon in the frec air anti t.hus reveal the gCIll'rnl
horizontal motions according to the altitud e of the bnlloon. Under proper conditions of infl.lli(lI\
the rate of ascent of the balloon is more or less accurately k11o'lm , and the obsor,utions nlso
afford some indi cation of th e up-and-doWD motions in the atmospherc, us ,ycll tl S t.he horizolltn i
motions, notwithstanding the steady ascent of th e bnlloon.
Arrangemen ts between tbeScienceand R esearch Division of t.h e Signal Corps and the \Y L'!\ t her
Bureau have been perfected, whereby a small group of men nrc engaged in redu cing ano C01llputing the results of the measurements of pilot balloons, und it. is planned in the nellr fll (un' (I )

balloons must be telegraphed, but this has not as yet been undertaken, und the results report(.\(i
by mail are necessarily for conditions some days prior to the dut.e of publication. It is hclio\'cd
that from observations of this character much useful information can be given concerning th(I

free motions of the atmosphere in different 'sections of the country, and the stations havo been
located with a view to making this information most valuable in 'connection with cross-country
flying along lines of civil aerial transport which have already been in a measure agroed upon.
The program ·of the subcommittee on the relation of the atmosphere to aoronautics is to
continue lines of work already started and in operation. The most importan t of these are:
(a) Aerological observations at Weather Bureau stations.-Daily obsorvations aro made of
free-air pressure, temperature, humidity, wind and cloud conditions at six favorably distributed
stations. This work is conducted by the United States Weather Bureau under appropriations
for that purpose. The stations are Broken Arrow, Okla., Drexel, Nobr., Ellondale, N. Dak.,
Groesbeck, Tex., Leesburg, Ga., and Royal Center, Ind.
(b) Pilot-bartoon observations at military ·statians.-Daily observations are made of fr ee-air
wind conditions by means of small pilot balloons whose positions and motions are observed by
theodolites. This investigation is conducted by the Science and Research Division, UnitedStntes
gignal Corps, at about 25 military training camps distributed over the United States from the
Rocky Mounto.ins to the Atlantic coast. In cooperation with the United States Weather
·-Buroau, pilot-balloon soundings are made also at five of its aerological ,stntions.
The objects of the work described above are as follows:
(1) To make the data obtained immediately available for the information and assistance
of all interested therein, such us (a) meteorologists, (b) aviators at training fields and those
engaged in cross-country flying over the transcontinental mail or other aerial routes, (c) the
Army and Navy for artillery services, and (d) pilots over the proposed trans-Atlantic route
from Newfoundland to Ireland or between other points.
(2) To summarize, atudy, and publish the data obtained for the purpose of furnishing
reliable information as to avernge free-air conditions of pressure, temperature, humidity, density, and wind direction and velocity by months and seasons, under different types of pressure
distribution at the earth's surface and in different parts of the country.
(3) To conduct spocial studies of atmospheric phenomena which are of-particular interest
to the aviator, as, for example, (a) air movements in thunderstorms, (b) height and thickness
of cloud layers in dillerent parts of low-pressure areas, (c) amount and vertical extont of convection, and Cd) gustiness of winds.
(4) To encourage the full er developm ent o'{ ·the systematic us.e of airylanes as an aerial
appamtus auxiliitry to kites and balloons, by means of which meteorological conditions in the
free air may be observed and measured.
QUARTERS FOR COMMITTEE.

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1918, the administrative offices of the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics were located in rented quarters in the Munsey Building,
Washington, D. C. The tochnical work of the committee, performed largely by or under the
direction of the various subcommittees, WA.S carried out in various laboratories and shops
belonging to the Govornment nnd to uni versities of learning whose facilities for scientific
research were placed at the disposal of the committee.
The sundry civil nct mnking appropriations for the fiscal year 191(:), approved July 1, 1918,
contained the following proyision in reference to quarters:
rrovided . That the Soc retary of \\'I\f is aut.horized and directed to furni 8h ollice Bpaco to the Kational Adviaor y
Committee for A('rollautics in governmontal buildin gs occupied by the Signal (',arpB.

In accordance with the I.l.uoye provision of litw, the Bureau of Aircraft Production of th e
War Department allottcci sufficient space to tho co mmittoe in Building D, Fourth Street tmd
Missouri Avenue NW., WA.Sliington, D. C., and this space was occupied by the committeo on
July 1, 1918. The locfttioll is the fourth wing, second .floor, immediately o.djoining the offices
of the Director of the Air Service, Mr. John D. Ryan. It is believed that its present location
betweon thc Buroau of Aircraft Production and :the Division 'of Military Aeronautics is most
appropriate for tho conduct of its own work and to aid in effecting close cooperation of effort
on the part of the mili Lary agencies in matters under the coguizfinco of the commi ttce.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVrSORY COMMrTTEE FOR AERONAUTrCS.

THE RESEARCH LABORATORY.

The research laboratory located at Langley Field, Va., has been completed and equipped
to undertake certain types of research work on aerodynamical problems and aeronauti c instruments. Tests of the performance of airplanes in free flight will also be carried out at Langley
Field.
The original purpose in the establishment of Langley Field by the War Department was
to provide an experimental fiying field and proving ground for aircraft. During the war the
field WIlB used primarily IlB a training school for aviators, but it is contemplated that after the
wa.r it will be fully developed in accordance with the original plan.
WIND TUNNEL.

AB a part of the equipment for scientific resea.rch, the committee contracted for the construction of a wind-tunnel building on the same plot of ground allotted to the committee by
the War Department for the conduct of its general activities at Langley Field.

The wind-tunnel building is of brick and steel construction, 42 feet wide, 90 feet long,
and 30 feet high. It will house a 5-foot modified Eiffel type wind tWlllel which has been designed
to provide for lessening the diameter of the wind stream to 30 inches for high-velocity investigations. When operating with the 5-foot section, the air stream is left open across the operating
room, and when operating with the 30-inch section, the stream is inclosed as in the N ationa1
Physical Laboratory type of tunnel.
The wind tunnel proper will be equipped with a thrust torque dynamometer for propeller
investigations and for determining the effect of the fuselage form upon propell er efficiency j
also an aerodynamic balance for making accurate measurements on aerofoils. Both the balance
and the dynamometer will be suspended from an overhead platform down into the wind stream.
In each cllBe the observer will work above the platform. Power will be supplied to the windtunnel propeller by a 250-horsepower, direct-current, variable-speed motor which will be operated by a 250-kilowatt synchronous motor genemtor set, with special arrangem<:'nts for speed
control and regulation.
The wind tunnel is designed for air velocities up to 130 miles per hour with t,he 5-foot
section and for 200 or more miles per hour when using the.30-inch section. Important reseflrch
problems will be undertaken as soon as the building and apparatus are completed.
As reported in the third annual report, it is contemplnted that an additionnl wind-twUlel
building and an engine-testing shed will be required in the near future.
OFFICE OF AERONAUTICAL INTELLIGEN CE.

In January, 1918, the need for a centrnl governmental depository in Washington for
scientific and technical data relating to aeronautics was recognized, and the Aircraft Board
suggested that the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics WIlS the logical govemmcntfll
agency for the collection and classification of such data to be made avnilable to the militnry
and naval air services in this country. This commit.tee accordingly estll.blished an Office of
Aeronautical Intelligence and adopted rules and regulations for the handling of its work. .
The committee has made the necessary arrnngements at home nnd abrolld for the coll ection of such datil. There are many sources of obtaining such informlltion, the thief flt the
present time being the r esea rch information committee, organized under tho National R ('sen rch
Counci l in Janua.ry, 1918, by fun ds provided by the Council of Nntiolltd Defense. It consisted
of the Director of Military Intelligence, Director of Naval Intelligenco, Ilnd Dr. S. W. St.rnttOIl
IlB chairmlln.
The purpose of the r esearch information committee is to serve as a co l1 cc t()r and distributor
of scientific and techrucal informat.ion regarding all wllr probl ems. Special committecs stntioned at London, Paris, and Rome collect information regllrding all phases of the scientifio
and t{)chnical study of war problems and' transmit the same to the central committee in Wl\shington for distribution to the interested services. Similarly, these special conunittces rl'Ceivo
information from WllBlUngton and transmit the Bame to the interested services abroad.

Since February, 1918, Dr. W. F. Durand, chairman of the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics, h88 served 88 scientific attache to the American Embll8sy in Paris, representing
the National Research Council on this research information service, and has, in addi tion, acted
as special representative of the Aircraft Board at the International Aircraft Standardization
Conferences in London in February and in October, 1918, hesides serving as a special liaison
officer in aeronA-utical mntt{lrs hetween France and the Unit{ld States.
In Septemher, 1918, Dr. W. C. Sabine, head of the department of technical information
of the Bureau of Aircraft Production and a member of the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics, was placed in charge of the Office of Aeronautical Intelligence of the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, with the title of director of scientific a.nd tech n'ic al
data.
Many valuable documents dealing with important research problems in aeronautics have
been secured by the Office of Aeronautical Intelligence, and copies have been distributed to
't:hose concerned with the problems involved.
The conunittee has estaLlished in connection with its Office of Aeronautical Intelligence,
. and particulllrly for the use of its engineering staff, a small selected library, con taining the most
useful and valuahle aeronautical and technical books and publications.
THE COMMITTEE AS AN IMPARTIAL AGENCY FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES.

During the past year the committee ha.s served the War and Navy Departments in the
capacity of an impnrtial agency for the settlement of disputes hetween contractors or private
part.ies on the one hand und the War or Navy Department on the other in matters where technical questiolls ha>e been in , olved. In each case in which it has been requested to act the committee has appointed a special subcommittee to investigate and submit report and recommendation. The more prominent cases handled by the committee during the past year are:
First, the dispute be.tween the War and Navy Departments on the one hand and the
Kessler 1.{ot{)r Co. relative to the d<\,OTee of compliance by the latter with .the technical provi. sions of II. contract for the de\-elopment of experimental aircraft engines.
Second, the controversy between the War Department and George Norman Albree et al.
over the merits of the Albree monoplane.
Third, the case of the con tract with the Glenn L. Martin Co.. f or a large bomhing plane
wi th It smaller pilot plane fastened t.o it in such a manner as to automat.ically control th e larger
plane Ilnd direct its co w'se after the small pilot plane has been released, the larger plane to carry
Hnd automatically release a lllrge bomb of the type invented by L ester P. Barlow, upon whose
suggestion the experiments were made. A contract hnd already been co mpleted, entai ling
t.he· expenditure of SI5,OOO, and a co ntroversy arose over the advisahility of placing a furt.h er
contract invoking 3150,000. In this case tne committee, oiter ca reful consideration, recommended that contmct be not placed, since the military value of the machine did not justify
its use.
AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.

Durillg tbe Pllst year the National Advisory Committee for Aeronauti cs has not undertaken
to fun ction on t.h e problems co nnected with aircraft product.ion nor in tho framing of the aircraft. progmm. These matters have been under the jw-isdiction of the WIU· and Nayy Departments, respectively, and t.heir problems have been coordinated in nn adv isory capacit.y, first ,
by the Aircraft Production Board and later by the Aircraft Board.
THE CLARKE THOMSON RESEARCH.

The Clarke Thomson l~esen.rc h W/lB founded by Mr. Clarke Th omson of Philadelphia, Pa.,
September 23 , 1916, for the purpose of aiding the advancement of the science of aviation.
In the latter part of the year 1917, Mr. Thomson tendered the fa.cilities of the Clarke

. TheflISt problem presented to the research hy the advisory committee -was ,the application of ~ the . Nutting 2-cycIe air-scavenging .principle to some 'existing engine, in order to test
(snd dotermine the possibilities of this particular type of engin e. The .research redesignod
Isnd · reconstruqted a :Dusenberg 4-oylinder :16"Valve aircraft <engine to operate on the Nutting
2-cycle air-scavenging principle. After construction, this engine was tested by the power
plants committee at the Bureau of Standards. The rosults 'of the exp erim ent indicated that
the inherent difficulties were too great ·to justify co ntinuation of th e devel opment 'When the
more important problems r equiring prompt solution were considered. It is planned to resumo
this investigation in the near ,future, us ' the possible )'esults are of great in torest.
In connection with the problem involving exhaust-gus sCl1.venging, the reselLrch conducted experiments of the flow of [l1.ir through :poppet valves. A mod el on 11. Liberty ongiue
cylind er was constructed, and experimentl1.l data dealing particularly with the merits of inlet.
valves, singly and in pairs, was obtained. The result of this experimentl1.l work is found
in Report No. 24 of the National Ad\Tisory Committee for Aeronautics, entitled" Air fl ow
through poppet valves."
SCIENCE AND RESEARCH DIVISION.

In the latter part of the y ea1' 1918 th e committee stated ill a letter to the Director of the
Air Service of the Army that there was need for greater coordination of the scientific und research
work in aeronautics, and that in order to render effec tive the work of t,h e diyision of science
and research, established by the Signal COI'])S a.nd later transferred -to the Bureau of Aircro ft
Production, it was believed desirable to reorgarV ze the division of science ond research.
The committee r ecommended that t.hat portion of the work of the Bureau of Aircraft
Production and of the Division of Military Aeron autics, which was th en uncl er th e direct·iou of
the di vision of science and r esearch of the Bureau of Aircraft Productioll , he orgllni zed und (lr

.CIVIL AERIAL TRANSPORT,

With the cossation of hostilities, tho committee promptly took up quostions relating to
civil and commorcial uses of aircraft aftor tho war. ' The great developments in and achievements wi th aircraft during the past 'few years, duo to the stimulation of war, indicate that the
civil and commercial uses of aircraft in the future may be considored 'to be practically unlimited.
'The comm ittee believos that Federal legislation should be enacted .govorning tho navigation
of aircraft in the United States and including the licensing of pilots, inspoction of machines,
usos of landing fiolds, otc'. The committee has brought this subject to the attention of tho
heads of the War, Navy, Commerce, and Post Offi ce Departments, and suggested that reprosentatiyes bo appointed to confer with the committee with a view to studying tho problem und
rocommending the general terms of -legislation' design ed to most effectively encourage the development of aviation in the United .States, and at the same time to guide the development as far
.!\:s praeticable along such 'lines as will render immed iate and effective military soryice to the
Nation in time of war.
ELEcrROMAGN~'TIC

SYNCHRONIZER FOR AERONAUTICAL MACHINE GUNS.

An i.nvestigation of the subject of synchronizing gears for machino guns to be used in
eonnection with airplanos hus been carried on in conjwlction with the staff of the Bureau of
Standards; and an olectromagnetic synchronizing gear has boen evolved which will p'erform all
the functions of the hydraulic and mechanical gears and with an efficiency fully as great. It
has certain marketl advantages, such as flexibility of mounting. This will enable the machine
gun to bo traversed on a horizontal plane, while at the sarno time being maintained in perfec t
synchronism.
VENEER WING CONSTRUCTION.

Sand louding llJ1d other tests made by members of the committee's technical staff on an
expcrimentalllirplane built by the Carolinn Aircraft Co. revealed the utility of wood veneer in
wing constIUetion , Dot only for ribs but also for the actual wing coverin g: -It was found that
t he internal drift wiros may he eliminated and the same weight per square foot of surface
obtained as in the ordinary wing. The matt~r was reported promptly to the Buronu of Aircraft
Production and attention invited to this method of wing construction as offoring a possible
meallS of chea per filld mo 'e rapid production of aircraft.

ANNUAL REPonT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

2. First distillate or crude benzine, cleaned, and purifioci without the use of acid or alkali.
3. Natural neutral gasoline.
4. Increased yield of straight paraffm gasoline from crude oil.
5. Separation of gasoline from crude oil by mechanical means.
Quality samples of pure paraffm gasoline from crude oil were completed and delivored in
July, 1918, and those were referred to the subcommittee on power plants for test at the
Bureau of Standards. The object of these investigations has been to produce a superior produc t
and at the same time increase the proportionate y ield of this superior grade of gasoline for
aircraft and also reduce the cost of production. This work is described in detail in Repo rt
No. 42, showing the nature of the tests and the dogree of success achieved.
EVOLUTION OF AIRCRAIT ENGINES.

The first man-carrying-airplane flights were mad e in Decembor, 1903, with the Wright
Brothers' engine, developing 12 horsepow(\r.and w(\ighing 152 pounds, or 12.7 pounds per horsepower. In 1910, seven yoo.rs In.ter, the average horsepower of aeronautic engines had increasod
to 54 and the woight decronsed to 5.7 pounds pOI' horsepower. In another seven years, 1917,
the average power output had advo.need to 240 horsopower llnd the weight lowered to 2.8
pounds pOI' horsepower. At the end of 1917 the Liberty-12 developed 400 horsepower for I~
weight of 800 powlds or 2 pounds por horsopower. Continuous progross in development enabled
the Liberty-12 to yield a maximum of 510 horsepower for a weight of 875 pounds, or 1.71 pounds
per horsopower, by the end of August, 1918.
The accompanying table, as also the CUIYC sheet, show::! the advance in the average maximum power-weight ratio by years for the enginc in actual flying service. It is to be especially
noted that the Langley-Manly ongine was 9 yel~ l~ ahead of its tim o in tho matt er of powor
output and 16 years ahead in weight per horsepower rat.io.
It may also be noted that at the end of 1917 tho Libort.r-12 was 65 por cont more powerful and 28 per cent lighter per horsepower thlln the average in service for that yoar. By
September 1, 1918, these figures wore changed to approximately 50 per cent and 25 por cent.
which indicate the superiority of the Liberty-12 over the average engine in servic.e at t·hnt time.

obtained in ooch caso. The inventor is in variably thanked for his pa.triotism ill'submitting
his device for tho. use of tho Government.
In additioll, a large number of suggestions and inventions of minor importance have been
recommended to the War and Na~y Departments for their further consideration. In all caseR,
overy invention find suggesLion has roceived immediaLe attention.
A smn.ll percentage of the inventions have been deemed worthy of serious a.ction afl,cr
having been carefully consid ered . These are listed below:

....

1. Instrument to prevent eXCe&l tran3verde streS:lCS in an airplane engine. This was given full trUils at !.fcCook
Field, and at UU' navy yard, WlI.9hingLon, D. G.
2. Murtitandem triplane system of aerofoil arrangement. This anangement WII.9 designed Lo ell.llble the carrying
of great loads -;vil.hout I?;reat incr()3.8e in the wing slJan. It was thon~ht necc.'lSIIIY to make 'll-ind tlmnel tests upon the
basic principle involved. These have been conducted at the navy yard wind tunnel.
3. A two·cycle air scavenged internal combustion engine. This wa.s carefully inveetigawd and experimented
upon, but waa not found suitable for the immediate needs of military aeronautics.
4. A magneLo having the well·known Bosch characteristics hut with several ingenious improvements in mochan·
ical design was submitted to careful laboraLory tests. The manufacturer is building a supply for service tests .
5. A design of variable camber steel rib intended t.o ser ve as part of one of the wingd of a biplane or triplane with
the rem!l.ining "ings of fixed camber. The use of such a de\-ice will materially increase the speed range of an airplane.
Extensi\'e tests of a mechanical nature have been carried out on this construction with very hopeful results.

In July, 1918, the War Department established an inventions section of the General St.aff
and issued instructions to a11 branches of the War D epartment to for.vard all inventions including those pertaining to aeronautics to the inventions section. This action has served to relieve
the eommittee of the duty of preliminary examination of a large number of in,entions and suggestions without value. Cooperation wit.h the inventions section hu.s been established, whereby
aU inventions den.ling with aeronautical sub jectswhich, after preliminary examinfi tion, are deemed
by the inventions section worthy of further consideration are referred to this committee. Other
departments of the Go,ernment, bowe\-er, ha\~e continued referring aeronautical in'ent.ions and
suggestions to this comm ittee direct.

GENERAL PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES.

Ai3 an introduction to the progress made on the genernl problems enumerated in the preceding annual reports, there is submitted the following statement entitled" Some Outstanding
Problems in Aeronautics," prepared by Dr. W. F. Durand, chairman of the NationlLl Advisory
Committee for Aeronl1utics, which was road as the Sixth Wilbur Wright M()morial Lecture
before the Aerol1auticnl Society of Great Britain on June 25, 1918:
SOME OUTSTANDfNG PROBLEMR IN AERONAUTICS .

Ten years ago the airplane waa a curiosity-a means wherewith, by a tour de force, a man might lift himsel{ froln
the ground and make a hazl\Tdous flight through quiet air-a means to attract curious crowds to fenced-in country fairgrounds to witness the marvel' of a body heavier than air actually rising from the ground and moving under some mcaaure
of control through the air, and returning safely to its starting point.
What the airplane has become in this short but poignant decade of the world's history and what it stands for
to-day this audience knows too well to need specification in detail .
It is perhaps well within the limits of conservatism to say that no achieveme nt of man's inventive and constructiv e
genius has undergone more intensive, more rapid, or more potentially significant developm ent than has that of flying
,'lith an apparatUB heavier than the air in which it moves.
It may be further noted that perhaps no technical and constructive achi evement of man haa ever called more
largely on science and on the aid of scientific research to aid in the solution of th e man y problems wbich ha ve presented themselves in the course of this aatonishing d evelopment in aerial navigation which the paat decad e baa witnessed.
In the circumstances which have determin ed the direction and character of the development o[ th e airplane
during this decad e, and especially in those which have been controlling during the paat three or [our years, it is only
to be expected that at the present moment we should find ourselves with many partly solved probl ems on our hands,
with others which we have hardly more than begun to attack on th e outskirt, and con fronted by others still, th e charac
acter and significance of which we ha.ve hardly begun as yet to appreh end.
On the present occaaion we may fi nd it not without i nterest to paBB briefly in review some o[ these problems, noting
thei r presentstatUB together with such indications aa may in some cases serve to point th e way toward a possible solution.
THE PROBLEM OF CONSTRUCTIVE MATERrALS.

Perbaps nowhere is th ere to be found a better illustration of the interdependenco of technical and scientific research
and study than in the manifold advanc es in various technical and scientific lines which conjointly ha ve made the airplane in i ts present form a struc tural possibil.i ty.
Broadly. the modern airplane comprises a body of some sort or form fitted with \\ings to provide th e supporting
surfaces, wi th a prime moyer or sou rce of power and \\ith a propeller o[ some typ e to t"rans[orm the power provided b y
the prime Inover into propu lsive work, and by the reac tion of the relative air strea m on th e under side o[ the 'rings to
sec ure th e Bust,\ining or liltiug force necessary to carry the weight. This cons truction calls for a "id e range o[ co ustru ctiv e materials. Thus the body and \\'i ngs , comp rising the airplane proper, require the following fairly distinct classes
(I[ stmctuml elements:
(1) Those i ntended prima ril y to give form , strength, and coherence to the stn! cture. Th ey rep resent in effect
the skeleton or foundation on wh ich t be en tire [unction o[ th e airplane aa suc h must d epend.
(2) Various seconda ry elemellts ill tended so to tie or con nect the prinCipal members toget her as to secu re bomogoneity of struc ture as a whol e. and mutually responsive ac tion on the part o[ the diITeren t clemen ts com prised und er
No . 1. The elem ents here co nsidered are those which, [rom a purely structural viewpoillt, may be cli\Sged aa 8trut~
Ilnd ties or tension members.
(3) iSuriace covering for the bod y find wings. This giv es outer form and contiuuity o[ suriaee and providea, furLit crIn ore. th e actual surfaces 011 wh.i ch t he air lilting find SUj:'port ing forces may act.
llro:J.dly speaking, the [undalllent,al problem in allairplfine cons tru ction is adequate strength or junct iou on miu..iUlum woight . In no other form of engi neering construction is tho necessity for weight saving so rigorous. Iu 11 very
roo.! BOll8e e\'ery ounce o[ material ent.eri ng into th e structure mus t be able to show a co mpetent passpo rt. The structunLl problem of the airplane is therefore one of strength in relation to weight. For th e main elements cOl11p riBing the
olc elULan o[ the structu re wood haa, thus [a r, held th e main place, with metal co ns tru c tion steadily !ltlmc tiug mo re

our 8Olution of a problem in technical industry; we may be able to see nothing better, and yet we may be well aaeured
that, as a simple matter of fact, there is 80mething better. This is a perfectly safe 8.BBertion, if only as based on the
law of probability of our having, at any given time, reached the final optimum poesible combination capable of furnishing a oolution of the problem.
Thus. as applied to the probl em of constructing the fram ework of the fUBelage of an airplane or of combining together
wing spars and ribs in such a manner o.s to form a wing skel eton, we may he sure, however good our prooent practice
may be and however satisfactory it may seem, that in reality it is not the best, and that long series of bettor 8Olutions
only await our intelligent and patient study.
In this and in all such probl ems th ere are always t wo fairly distinct though in terrelated parts:
(a) What materials are best suited to th e purpose in vi ew.
(b) What disposition shall be made of tho materials adopted.
Thus, in the co.se of the fuselage. granting wood material b e adopted, there remains the question 113 to the very
best distribution of such material o.s between the main longitudinal elements, or 10 ngeroIIll, and the intermediate elements; aleo o.s to the extent to which reliance may be placed on th e outer covering, especially if of plywood . What
airplane designer can feel sure that, even with given materials, he ho.s reached the optimum distribution of function
o.s between the main and secondary elements of the fuselage and of a plywood outer covering. '
Much 1et!8, wha t airplan e d esigner can feel any confid en ce in having now reached an optimum combination, once
we admit the possibility of metal construction or of BOm e combination of metal and wood, with all the possibilities oC
the n ew light metal all oys and of the new alloy steels with th eir astonishing physical characteristics?
So far as conditioned by the a pplica ti on of the ordinary loading tests, static in character, and aside from the poeeihle
resultll of dynamic attack, shock, long-continuer! vibration, etc ., we may perhaps frankly admit that the present state
of metallurgy is able to supply us with material, either in the way of light aluminum alloys or special steel alloys,
which , if properly used, will enabl e us to meet all such static tests in airplane constru ction, and on even terms or better
as regards weight compared with wood. .
. If such is the C8J:le, it certainly stands before us o.s a problem for the near future to pM!! in review moot thoroughly
th e entire range of constru ctive materials, metallic as well ns wood, and to d eterrn.iue, in the light of the experien ce
which we are so rapidly accumul ating during th ese days of stonn and streBB in military aeronautic.'S, the combinations
of materials which may serve to give the moot efficient servi ce on the minimum of weight.
In connection with this search for n ew and better ma terials must go hand in hand search for better modes of combination in the structure-in other words, better structural design . It goes without saying that the best general typ e
of design, in the way of the distribution of ma terials, forms and proportions of mem bers, etc., will vary with th e c1o.ss
of material employ ed. There must be some optimum d esign with wood. There will likewise b e an oth er and undoubtedly a different optimum design in the case of steel, and again different in the case of aluminum or other all oys. Thus
the search for the best final combination is a. search for an op tinlUm optimorum; for th e best pOBBibl e material and for
the bes t p06Si ble d esign using such ma terial.
What ord er of saving may be looked for in the near fu t ur e from any such search it is, of course, idl e to pred ict.
Could we, h owever, approach somewhat closely to th e best usc of til e bes t combin ation of materials even now avail abl e
in the fie ld of engineering construction and without waiting for new a nd superior materia.ls whi ch the mew.llurgica l
art will doub tl ess b e abl e to furnish, it seems not unre:tsona b Ie to anticipate the possibili ty of a mark ed s:w ing in wt)igh t
withou t 1088 in streng th or sec uri ty .
This, then, stands ou t as one of th e grea t p r o bl em~ of :teronallticnl engineering- that oi th e best materi..'l.ls and of
their bes t use. Much lulB already bee n done, but mu ch yet remains, and ri ch rewa rds moo t assured ly await patient
and well-directed work in this field.
THE pnO OLEM OF S IZE.

One of the moot interesting of the problems presented to the aeronau tical engineer is that of th e limiting sue and
carrying capaci ty of air pla nes. Is there such a limit? If so, what ia it? Wh y is i t? And h ow may it b e removed
or extended ?
In dea ling with this problem we come, of n ecessity, into co nt:l ct with the bws of similitude of gcometrir., lly simil!lr
structu res. It is well k nown tha t un der £Imple modes of loading geometrica ll y simi lar stmctures of wing find fuseh'ge
wil l h ave simiJar factors of safety under equal unit lo:tds. nut for such structures, if strictly sim ilar geometri call y , tJ1C
weights themselves will increase as the cubes of th e similar d imensions, while the :t reas of wi ng or supporting surfac('6
will only incrC38e as th e squa re, and h ence the ra tio of " eigh t to area will contiuuollsly increase as th e linear di mension.
I n these circumstances it is readily shown that in acco rda nce with th e rela t ion of the factors invoh 'ed Ul(~rc wil l
be, for any given speed, some size for which th e lifting c:tJl:tcity O\'er and above th e st ruc tur e i tself will be a max imulll
and above which the lifting capaci ty over an d above the strudllr e wil! b ecome 1Ct<S and less with incrC38e in size, gmdlI all y reaching zero for some yalu e of the size of th e structure. Th is woul d mt)l\n tha t a t such point th e su pporli ug
force deve loped a t the speed in qu es tion would be just enough to lift th e struct ure i tself frO th e grouud but Inth
IU
no reserve for additi onal load .
This is, of course, a d efinite law d erived from well-known principles of geometry and calculus, and if it were tllO
whole story it would indeed tend to raise an insuperabl e bnr b efore co ntinued ex pansion in size. If such wero tllO cn,.,e ,
it would mean in effec t that incrC38e in lifting capacity could only b e reached by th e following measures:
(1) Redu cing to a minimwn th e relation of weight of structure to area. That is, general improvoment in the
program of design and reduction of weight of structure in relation to supporting surface.

(2) Reducing to a minimum the resiBtance of the plane at the given speed and likewiae the relation of woight to
hOl1l6power.
(3) Raiaing to a maximum the relation ollifting force to area, coDBiatent, h ow eyer, with the decrease of the total
propulsive reeiatance of the plane.
Were we indeed subject, without recourse, to the operation of thia law of mechanics and geometry, wo should be
in a sorry state regarding the future d evelopment of the airplane na regards size and carrying capacity. We should b e
limited strictly within the bounds of the developments made pOBBible by improvements and Ildvancee along Ule linee
na indicated above. Eu t, fortull8.tely for the future of aerial navigation, wo are not so limi ted, and there seems no rC3.80n
why, at the preeent time at least, we should need to anticipate any special limit na necessarily im posed on airplano
collBtruction as regards either size or carrying capacity.
We are able to eecape from the consequence of thia law due to two facts:
(1) It ia not necessary that a large element of an airplane, a wing in particular, should bo geometrically similar
in structural characteristics to .a 8lllA1l one. For a certain size the structural elements will partake of certain characteriatics. As the over-all size increasee, theee elements may take on new characteriatics. Those which had been
solid may now become hollow or of lattice or built-up fOrID. The law of geometrical similitude will not hold and the
wmht will not neceeaarily increase in ratio with the cube of the over-all linear dimensions.
(2) It is by no means nec~ that a large airplane shall be, in its general form, a geometrical copy of a small
one. While both will have similar elements, Buch elements need not be the same in number or arrangement. In fu.ct,
0.Q.El of the m06t obvious of means for increasing lifting power ia to increase the numb er of the wings or lifting elements.
There is no reason, at least structurally, why wings and connecting elements should not be increased in numb er beyond
anything now in use or even considered-increased to a point which would give a size and lilting power great enough
to meet any d emands which we can now formulate or whi ch the future seeIDB likely to present.
Structurally, therefore, the problem of increased size presents three problems, na foll ows :
(1) The structural problem of BO developing the character of the elements of airplane construction, such na wing
spars, longerons, struts,Jibs, etc., that with increase in over-all dimellBion the weight sho'!l not increase sensibly fMter
than as the square of such dimension.
(2) The structural problem of combining the larger elements of airplane cOllBtruction, such na wings, fuselagea,
or engine nacellee, with their connecting structuree, in such manner as to secure for a given wing area th e minimulll
weight of secondary structure.
(3) The aerodynamic problem of combining multiple wing elements in such manner as to reduce to a minimum
the interference of one with another. This ia a problem which opens fnacinating pOBBibilitiee to the student of experimental aerodynamics--a problem on which already BOme beginnings have been made but one far from a fmal or na yet
wholly satisfactory BOlution and one on which the future development of greatly increased size and carrying capacity
seems deetined to largely depend.
In short, th en, BO far as increase in size ia concerned, there seems no reason to apprehend any particular limit or
any serious difficul ty on the part of the scientist and the engineer in m ee ting the d emands of the {u ture in these reepects.
The difficulties seem no greater than those which have been overcome in the case of ocean shipping as shown by th e
con tinu ous development from the early beginning of the application of engine pOI\"cr to ocean navigation during the
first half of the last century down to the m9.mmoth n aating structures of the present time; and if we mlly take any
indication from the accelerated rate of progress which has characccrized the entire history of aerial navigation, we
may feel confident that we shall not have to wait a half or three-quarters of a century for a parallel de'·elopment in the
hitter field.
VARiABLE WING AREA OF VAlHABLE WING CAMBE ll.

1'0 mentio n on ly one of the many remaining problems which are connected with the design and cons truction of
the airplane itself, a word may be said with regard to the problem of variable wing area . Broadly speaki.ng, the id eal
airplane should be abl e to change its wing area in accordance with th e conditions aud circumstances of night. For
ease in getting oIT the ground at a moderate speed , for case in landing likewise at a moderate or low speed, there ia Deed
uf:l relatively large area of wing or slipportingsurface. For the attainment of high speed, rod lI ced 1I·i..ng ar('a~ nre need ed,
and nre, furthermore, sufficient for the support of the weigl· t at such high speeds. 'l'he supporting furet' gained by a
gil·en form of airplane wing depends on th e area, the speed , and the angle of attack, llnd there Irill be some combinatl on beet for each set of conditions. To meet theee conditions, varying from tim e to tiUle throughout th e course of
u. flight, a co rrelative variation i n wing area is needed.
1'0 some extont the same ends liay be m et by changing the camber or curvature and form of the fore and aft sec ti on
of the wing .
Thus, when th e camber or fore ,\l1d aft curvature is increased, tb e forro will be more Buit'lble for ltlnding a t a red uCeU
"peed, whilo th e curve fiutccned nnd camber redu ced th e form will roore rCRdily fn yor tho Rltllinment of relativ ely
high speed.
The pr?blem of an adju B
t.:lble wing, either as to extent of area or camber or both, is a favorite one with students
of aeronautics, and we may hope for BOme measure of usoful and practical solution. Thus far, of tho many devicea,
.. nd fOrIDB proposed, nono has tIO far fully justified itself as an altogether satisfactory and practical solution of
the problem .

MOTIVE POWER.

Paasing now to the motive power and its application to the propulsion of the airplane, a moat interesting and important series of problems chall enges our attention . Only the more important can be noted here.
Ftul.-One of the moat important of these is that of fuel. \Vbat is to be the future fuel for the airplane or for
aerial navigation in its wider aspects? How long will our stores of crude petroleum oil from which we now obtain
our petrol or essence of petrol, as it is ' variously termed, continue to furnisb this all-important element in the
preseot program of power development? Doubtleas there are large stores of p etrol eum oils yet undiscovered, but
we may safely assume that we are using up a supply in the nature of a bank deposit. We are using our principal
and not living on the interest. So far as we know, nature is not now engaged in making for us petroleum oils, certainly not in any proportion to our rate of expenditure. To such a gen eral program of consumption th ere is, of
course, but one end-ul timate exhaustion. This is, of course, on ly one phase of the overshadowing menace which
the modern social and industrial world must face some time when our present supply of carbon and hydrocarbon
fuels begins to become exhausted, unl ess, indeed, we develop or discover in the meantime some other source of
energy which will ad equately take th eir place. This is perhaps a question which need not seriously concern the
prosentgeneration, but wh en we take a long look ahead-a look, for example , as that covered by the development of
Europe from th e days of th e Cresars or even from the time of, say, Galilee-we may realize with startling emphaaia th e
need of foresigh t with regard to a source of energy adequate to the world 's demands. Various ages have been designated
as of stone, bronze, etc. The present might well be designated :l8 that of natural energy. Our entire civilization,
io a material B
ense, rests upon the utilization of sources of natural energy which are not in exhaustible and which
are, in fact , becoming exhausted, in some caaes, with menacing rapidity. In the m eantime we must , and presumably we shall, make some shift to tap efficiently other sources now known, or we may haply discover sources
which to-day lie beyond our presen t vision.
A long look ahead for a erial navigation therefore shows that if the present line of development is to continue th ere
will be a serious problem to be m et sometime, and that perhaps before many d ecades-th e problem of a fuel suited to
the needs of aeronautical prime mOl'ers, at a time when present petroleum sources ,,-ill no longer yield the supply
which we now accept and use with so little thought for th e morrow.
nut with regard to the qu estion of fu els we need not go so fa r afield as to loo k into the coming decades for interesting and important problems. Perhaps th e one most pressing for present solution is the q uestion of what is the beal
fuel for the mod ern aviation engine, having in view the three requiremen ts-power, economy, with reliability and dumbility. Out of the exigencies of th e present war have com e many serious and extended researches rela ting to the
problems of military aviation, and of these none is perhaps of greater significance r egarding the futur e of commercia l
aviation than th e studies which have been mad e regarding aviation fuels . \Vbile matters relating to th e problems of
military aeronautics must be spoken of with much reserve, it will perhaps be p ermissible to say b efore this alldienc('
that from these studies three principal results seem to have been rather definitely established . Th('se arc-(a) As between the various grades of aviation motor fu els which have been used during recent yc..lrs , and com'
prising a rather wide range of composition and of physical and technica l characterist.ics, there is but littl e tochoos('
from tIle standpoint of pOI,er or economy a lone. Tbis assumes, of cou rse, that the fuel is a genuine motor fu('l alld the
res ults rega rding power or economy relate to an assumed period of effective oper.ltion under such fuel. ] t mllst not,
howeyer, be assumed that th ere are no differences in power or economy trace'l ble to the fuel employed, for such is
far from being th e case. It is , howeve r, within the limits of rea.gouable stateDlent to say that such differeuccs are
r ~l.\ ti\'ely small and in mos t circumsta nces wou ld not of thcmseh'es co nstitute n dete rmining or controlling fa cttl r.
(b) As between such moto r fu els mark ed differences do seem to be indicated as rega rd s their in!lll ence on th e life
allti reliability of the motor, especi:llly their influ ence on long-time tests or in actual ser.-ice on 10ng-tinlC lIights.
(c) For the various fuels, in ord er to realize the best resu l ts either as regards power, economy, or life allti reliabili ty,
SPOcilll and i nd ividua l carburetor adjustments are necessary and such as can on ly be d etermin ed by triaili ode r actll.\1

It may perhaps be further said that the problem of an excell en t and reliable motor fu el for Qyiation purp es se(> lllti
to h:l\'e been s:\tisfactorily sol ved. rts specijcatioDs and range of characteristi c, physi cal and chemi cal, arc pretty

and among theso a few of the more pressing may here be noted.

In the way of power per cylinder we are now reaching close about 40 horsepower as a maximum.
In the way of cylinders per engine we have reached a stage of development where the 12-cylinder engine ill quite
a standard type, and higher numbers such as 16 and 18 represent only questiollB of detail. It is not too much to say
that the 600-horsepower en.,oine is quite within the reach of present practice and may be realized as called for. We
have long Bince become accUBtomed to two and throe engines on a Bingle plane and are now Beeing lour enginOB in
various recent dOBigns. It is therefore clear that if a power plant of 2,500 horsepower on a single structure is wantod,
it iB quite within the scope of present practice to realize and provide such a plant.
And if four engines of 500 or 600 horsepower each, there is no reason why the number may not be increased, at
least to a point beyond the prOBent apparent need for power on a single structure.
On the other hand, it must be admitted that, having in view the limitatiollB of present practice, the mOBt simple
and in fact the only reliable way of extending power is by a multiplication of the number of cylinders rather than by
an increase in the size of the latter. The fact that a 2,OOO-horsepower equipment would presumably require from
40 to 60 cylinders shows the formidable degree of multiplication of small eleme'n ts requi red to realize such a rOBult.
The real problem of size or capacity of en"oine is therefore one of power in a single cylinder. Wbat can be expected
in this direction, and in what way shall search be directed?
The present limitation arises largely as a matter of cooling, and it is in this direction that search may well be made
for ways and means of effectively increasing the power capacity of a single cylinder in an engine of the aviation type.
This is a problem which is distinctly outstanding and well worth our serious attention and study.
.... The carburetor.-Another problem connected with the engine is that of the carburetor. At the start of aeronautic
engineering the carburetor naturally took its initial form and arrangement from the already fairly well developed
automob ile engine carburetor. This was but natural since both engines' are of the same type and both use the same
general form of fuel. In respect of the conditions of operation, however, there is a marked an'd important difference.
The automobile operates at or near a fixed level and hence in an atmOBpheric medium of sellBibly fixed pressure and
density. With the airplane the case is very different. The latter may change its level by thousands of feet in a
few minutes or even seconds, as in vertical or nearly vertical dives, rapid spirals, etc. This difference in the conditiollB or operation introduces a factor of distinct significance and of great importance in the design and disposition
of the carburetor. Experience in the air has clearly shown the importance of this new factor, and it is not too much
to say that the problem of the entirely satisfactory carburetor, capable of automatically answering to the various
atmOBpheric conditions under which it mUBt work, is distinctly an outstanding problem. It is true that much progress
haa been made, and as the result of laboratory research, checked by actual experience in the air, we now know much
better than, say, two years ago, the fundamental conditiollB which mUBt be met by the carburetor for the aeronautical
engine . The present solution can hardly be COllBidered as final, however, and we may fairly admit that the whole
problem of carburetion, including the manifold supply of the carbureted mL,ture to a multi-cylinder en"oine, should,
Ae BOOn as may be, receive a thorough and fundamental restudy in the light of the information to be drawn from the
experience of the past three or fOlu years.
Ignit ion.-Another problem which we should view as outstanding is that of ignition. It is true that ignition, as
now reali zed with the best equipment, seema to be fairl y reliable and effective . 'nut the whole programme is open
I.(J the objecti on of requiring an entire electric power plant of a highly specified type, together with electric conductors
.. nd the spark plug for prod ucing the spark between the discharge points within the cylinder, represents a very compli c ato ~l and highly specialized device for producing the initial ignition within the body of compressed fuel mL,ture .
In its present state it is Q marvel of scientific and technical development, and it does its work; but it is complicated
IUld subject to many possible modes of derangement, and, as we all know, has been anr:! is still the seat of some of the
moet serious of the engine d ifficulties to which the power plant as a whole is subject,
I ha\'e never been able to persuade myself that this exceedingly complicatod and specialized auxiliary equipment was to be the final solution of the problem of producing ignition in an internal combustion engine. 1f we can
anticipate the explosion engine of the year 1968, assuming that our grandchildren are still dependent on hydrocarburo
CuelM at that date (and, ftuthermore, that they are still available), it would seem as though some more direc t and simple
modo of initiating the co mbustion in the cylind ers woul d have been fou nd. Still, otherwise, 11"0 may say that on th o
I.w of probability tho chances are ovendlClmingly against OUf haviIlg at the presout moment devolopod tho very
h~t method of ignition, The laws of ph~'siCB and chemistry, by a probability whi ch almost reaches ce rtainty, coutaln !lOme potential combination of factors which will pormit of eliminating much of the comploxity and delicacy of
&djWltrnont which is so characteristic a featlu e of the present mode.
It is PQrhaps proper to add hero that stud ies in this direction have already been made, and with rosu lts whidl
nfTnr promiso of interesting developments in the futur e. The path of perfection is lik ely to be not a short one, how.
"'-nr, nnd we cau soe no pruspoct of an\' dovelopment in the to-morrow of progress llkely to displace eloc tric ignition.

MAINTENANCE OF POWER AT ALTITUDE.

....

We como now to a problom of the very highest present and future importance, that of maintaining the power of
the engine at high altitude.
Tho situation as it develops in the case of an airplane mounting to higher and higher levels in tho atmoophero
is readily appreciated with a morn.ont's thought.
The power of the engine arisoa from tho combustion of vaporizod hydrocarbon fu el. The power por cyclo for a
given cylindor will, therofore, to a first approximation, and l18Surning a sensibly constant efficiency of thermodynamic
transformation, vary directly with the weight of the fuel which can be burned per cycle. Dut this in turn depondR
upon, and is conditioned by, the amount of oxygen which can be drawn into the cylinder per intake stroke of the cyclo.
Dut the oxygen is brought in as one of the constituents of the atmosphere, and hence the amount of oxygen available
per intake stroke will depend upon, and be directly proportioned to, the amount of air which can be drawn in. Dut
in terms of volume, just a cylinder full or more exactly, just the volume reprosented by the piston displacemont in
moving from one end of the stroke to the other, can be brought in. Hence we may at least depend on what we may
term & cylinder volume of air, no matter where we are. But just here ariaes the trouble. The actual weight of air
deponds conjointly on the volume and on the density, and, unfortunately for the aeronautical engine at least, the donsity
of the atmosphere decroaaes steadily with altitude, so that at 15,000 feet, for example, the density is only about 60 per
cent of the normal density at the oarth's surface. It is clear, then, that an aeronautical engine, other things equal,
will draw in per intake stroke only about GO per cent of the weight of air at this altitude as compared with the indraft
at the earth's surface. Honce it will be able to burn only 60 per cen t of the fu el and with equal efficioncy will develop
only 60 per cent of the power.
But here we must stop for a moment and inquire as to the effect of such reduction of power on the speed of the airplane. We know that, other things equal, the resistance of an airplane to propulsion through the air at uniform spee<l
varies directly with the density of the medium. Hence with the samo speed as when near the surface of the earth.
and at the same altitude and angle of attack, the airplane at 15,000 foot elevation would experience only 60 per cont
of the resistance, require 60 per cent of the thrust, and, at constant revolutions of the propeller, 60 por cent of the power
from the engine . It appears, therefore, at first sight as though wo had lost nothing in speed by the reduction of the
power of the engine. If the latter has boen reduced to 60 per cent of its amount at low leyels, so has the re.~istance
and power required, so that the speed realized should remain the same.
Such would, indeed, be the case if this were all, but unfortunately -oThor considerations enter, and the simpl e
relation of uniform speed at varying altitudes can not be realiz ed without compensating ieatures.
Thus, if at a constant speed and constant angle of attack for the wings the roaiatance to propulsion is only 60 pN
cent as great at the altitude of 15,000 feet as on the ground, it is unfortu nately the same for the lifting force de\'elop('{l
by the wlngs. This also ia only 60 per cent as great, while the weight of the machine remains sensibly constant at all
altitudes. Let us grasp this fact clearly that whi le, at const.ant speed and attitude of flight, the resistan ce, th e lift, anel
all other aerodynami c forces involved vary directly with th e density of the air and decreaae with th e altitud c, th ('

(1 ) We may sce k to inc rease th e speed until at such in creaaed value th e lift will cqual th e weight of tbl' plnn<'.
Und er th e conditiom ass um ed this would involve an in crease of speed of about 30 per ccnt, thus incrCMling th e r c~istan cr

In brief, at an altitud e of, so.y, 15,000 feet the plane must fly at a less advantageoUB angle of attack but with more
rwstance, and that the engine will be able to burn only about GO per cent as much fu el and will transform the resulting
hoat less effectively, than when at low altitudes. Therefore, the power developed will be less than 60 per cent and
insufficient to maintain tho Bame speed; and \vith diminishing speed there may be further loss of efficiency in the
propeller and a further loss of speed, until finally matters become adjUBted at some value usually dofinitely and sometimes considerably less than that corresponding to low-level conditions.
As an over-all practical result an airplane normally loses horizontal speed as it ascends to higber altitudes.
Oonfronted with this fundamental fact, what is to be done? Such loss of speed, especially in a military se nse, is
or may becomo vory serious, and one of the largo and d efinitely outs~'\nding probl ems in aeronautical ongineering at
th e present time centers about the possible ways and means of meeting this condition.
The obvious proximate solution is to avoid, so far at! may be, the decrease in the amount of air handl ed per intJ\ke
stroko of the piston as the plane ascends to higher and higber altitudes.
Broadly, two courses are open. Firet, we may definitely and frankly design the plane and engine for a certain
desired performance at a given altitude, say 15,000 or 20,000 feet. This is a straightforward problem in aeronautical
engineering. Given the desired schedule of operation and the altitude, we can determine the resistance to be overcome and the horsepower required, and can design the engine accordingly. In such case the volume of the cylinders
will be sui ted to th e rarefied air in which the engin e is to work, and all proportions and details will be worked out on
this basis.
It will be obvious that such an engine will have much too large a piston displacement volume wh en at low altitudet.hat is, it will be oversize and overpowered relative to the plane. In fac t, operati(ln near or on the ground IInder the
same adjillltm ents as at altitude would be quite out of the question . Means must therefore be provided for reproducing, wh en on the ground or at low altitudes, substantiall y the operating conditions at high altitud es and low air
d e nsity-that is, th e conditions for which the engine was d esigned, This ma.y be most conveni ently don e by throttling
down the air intake 80 that while air at or near full sca level derurity may surround the engine, it will be reduced in
pressure at the intake throttle to such a degree that the amount actually taken into the cylinder w-:ill only cqual that
which \'7ollld no rmall~' enter, without throttling, at higb altitude.
On the othcr hand, we may definitely design tbe engine (or operation at or near sea level and with size o( cylinders
and all proportions and adjustmentaworked out accordingly, and then by a supplementary device endQ..,\vor to mn..intain,
or to nearl y maintain, such conditions within the engine itself even if it is at high altitude and surrounded by air of a
lowcr d ensity.
This solution calls for some supplementary form of compressor or equivalent device which shall opemte on the
rarefi ed air as a first stage and raise it irom the low pressure characteristic of the altitude up to or nearly to norma l lowaltitude pressure and density .
Each of th cse alternatives represents a perfectly possible solution . Each has its special advantages and disadvantages. Each has its ad'·ocntes as a solution of this important problem .
The first solution is th e simpler of the two, since it involves no special or additional device for compressing the air.
H does, however, mcnn cxtra weight in the engin e which is always there and which \\-:ill reduce correspondingly thc
net carrying capar ity of the plane.
. .
On th e oth er hand , the compressing de,-:ice of th c second solu tion is not easy to realize satisfac toril y and it al so
in "oh 'es ex tra "'eight, th ough presumauly less than in the case of the first eolution. Again, its operati on ns a separatc
or illd epcnd ent unit for realizing a preliminary com pression of th e air is less efE cient tban to do th c wholc comprCMion
in th c engine itself and by the engin e piston, as in th e first solution . Only extend ed and careful tria l will prcsumab ly
hc ab le finally to decidc wbich is on th e wh ole the b ettcr B
olution of the two.
Th e rcse rye ne c e~sary with regard to mili tary mnttcr3 mak es it um,ise to attempt to give any acco un t on this occasi oll

lutions; and, other things equal, the power developed will vary di rectly with the revolutions which can be realiz.od.
Again, it is easy to see that the size and amount of surface of the nir screw blades will present a controlling feature
regarding the revolutions which can be realized_ ThUB, the air scrow may be enormoU.'lly oversize, too largo in di.\meter,
and presenting a large and unwieldy surface to the air. Suppose this to be the case with a plane of size suited to the
air screw hut not to the engine-that is, the engine is far too small for either air screw or plane. In such case the engine
simply will not be able to make its normal number of re .... olutions. It will he held down by the excessive rcsistance t{)
rotation presented under such circumstances, and may thus develop far less than the normal power which it is capnhle of
under proper conditions. Many other combinations may occnr which we can not dtop to discuss or even to men tion.
Droadly speaking, the plane, the engine, and the air screw as tile propelling agent form a moet closely knit combination, and each interacts in a more or less controlling manner on the opemtion of tue other two.
In order even to make a start with the problem of the air screw, it is therefore necessary to l188ume conditions
regarding b;t.h the plane and the engine. If these conditions as assumed are then realized in practice, and if the deeign
has been well carried out, the anticipated results may be reached. If, on the other hand, the l188umed conditions are
not realized as regards the plane and the engine, then no matter how well the design of the air screw may have been
carried out, the anticipa~d results will not be realized. No matter how good the air screw may be by it.self, no matter
how carefully designed and constructed, no matter how faithfully , it may be able to realize the conditiollS for which
it i.e designed, if there are not the conditions under which it is actually placed for service, the result.s, economic and
otherwise, will be unsatisfactory; not necessarily by reason of any fault in th e air Bcrew as such, but due simply to its
lack of adaptation to the conditions of operation. An effective nil' screw is therefore not only one whicll is properly
designed and constructed in itself, but also one which is permitted to o)Jemte under the condition~ intended and
contemplated in the design.
The general problem of the air screw is by no means, however, to be classed distinctively as out.standing. Instead
an enormous amount of work has been done on it, both theoretically and experimentally, and in its main features it
has been brought fairly within the limits of a solved problem. There have been three modes of approacll . brie fly aa
follows:
(1) The analysis, geome trically, of the blade of an air screw into a series of elements occu pying esch a narrow
strip running acroes the blade from leading to following edge and making up, by their summation, the blade , as & whole .
Each of these el~ents or strips is then considered as, in effect, a little elementary areofoil and for which the usu!ll
aerodynamic characteristics are readily determined, eith~r by direct f-xperiment un a model or by selection or interpolation from and among the large amount of available data regarding such areofoils which have already been submitted to experimental investigation. With such data in hand relating to the series of elements going to make up
the blade, it is a matter of simple computation to combine them in such manner as to represent the action of the blade
as a whole, under the conditions assumed, and thus, in general terms, the problem is solved.
(2) A law of similitude is assumed and a small model propeller is tested out experimentally and under condition~
which permit, under the law of similitude l188umed, the translation of the observed result.s for the model int.o th e
probable resul ts for the full-si zed air screw.
. .
(3) Full-aized air screws are tested out as nearly as may be under flying conditions and are made th e ultimllte
basis of design.
The limitations of method No. 1 arise from the foll owing:
(a) The coeflicient.s derived for areofoils correspond to straight line motion between the air and th e foil . whereni'
in the air screw the relative motion is in a helical or spiml path.
(b) The actual velocities for which such coefficients are derived are usually for speeds not exceeding GO or iO mil('~
per hour, whereas the actual speeds of th e tip elements of air-screw blades may move Iltspeeds of 500 m . h. and upwll.rd .
The extent to which the usual square of the speed law may be extended to such valucs is not as yet fully kno,yn.
(e) The coeOicients used are derived for the various areofoil sections or elements indhid u!llly, wh er('as in the !lctua!
air screw the~' all act conjointly or collectively in making up the air-screw blade.
Application of method No.1 can not therefore be made except in so far as it is justified by !lctual and final expe rience on full -~ i zed forms under flying conditioDf.
Method :\0. 2 (that with reduced-size models \ has the limitation that the law of ~imilitudc employed j.,. of n ('e('""it. ~·

Theee phaaes which thus Btand out represent in effect the lack of an adequate correlation between the three methods
oC approoch as above deecribed.

It iB obvious that if we could develop an adequate and reliable correlation between the reeults of the computation
according to method No.1, lind the final test und er flying conditioOB according to method No.3-if, in other wordM,
we could ad equately determine th e error of No. 1, and hence the correction to be applied in any given cll8e. then a
pencil and pad of paper would go a long way toward furnishing the material for th e solution of th e problem of air·B ew
cr
de!'ign, once that we are permitted, of course, to assume a definite set of operati ve co ndi tioOB.
Or, again , if we could know more accurately and more widely the character and amount of error to be anticipatod
in the use oC the small models according to method 2, we should be in a position to use the experimental model method
with better assurance of definite and reliable results for the Cull-s:ized screw later to be COOBtructed.
It seemB likely that thiB (mal correlation of compntation with ultimate result may bes t be made in two stagce.
The first should comprise a careful study oC the relation between the results derived by the comp utatioOB of method 1
and the model tests of method· 2. Such a correlation would then permit us to pass readily from the results by computation to the probable results by model.
The second correlation should then comprise a series of comparative tests to d etermine v.ith sufficient generality
ol application the character and amount oC correction to be applied to the results of model test in order to satisfactorily
reproduce the reeults to be expected from full-s:i zed forms.
This would by no means require the teeting of a full-£i zed C
orm corresponding to each model. If so there would,
of course, be no use in making model tests. The whole program might as well be carried out directly by tests on fullsi zed forms. It appears reasonabl e to expect, however, that a well-selected and not too numerous series of tests, properly distributed among t he various characteristics of form and of operation , would serve adequately to give th e correlation desired.
With such correlatioOB eetablished we should then have two methods-:\os. 1 and 2-- available for the design of
air screws. No.1 available with no more than a pencil and pad of paper (once the standard section coefficients determined) and No. 2,.-by model, ready to supply a vast amount of detailed information regarding operation under
varying conditioOB, and which may be realised rapidly and effectively once the model iB mad e.
If we have spent eo much time over these matters relating to the air screw, it is because of its importance 118 an
el ement in aerial navigation, and in order that we may th e better note just what part of the general problem is still
outstanding.
This, as we have seen, liee primarily in the matter of the correlation !.Je tll'een the three me thods outlined . There
ie, indeed , need for continuing experimental research, especially on systemati call y selected forms, both mod el and
full si ze; and such con tinuing experimental work combined with carefully direc l~d studies of correlation will go far
toward giving us an assured and adequate basis for the practical solution of the air-screw problem 118 appli ed to aerial
na vigation.
Reaction between air 3(UW and plane. -Perhaps th e widest and moat important outstanding probl em in connection
with airplane propulsion has relation to the reaction b etween the plane and the propeller- t.h e influence of the structUIl'S adj acent to th e propeller on its performance, economic and otherwise, and thll tnflu ence of th e propeller on the
plane, both as regards its lift and its net resistan ce to propulsion. ThiB is a field which is largely outsta nding. It
must be attacked chiefly by the experimental meth od-by model with res ults checked up by CO lllpariBon with full
scale triab so far 118 practical.
Multiple air screws on one shnft. -O f a cloeely related nature is th e p roblem of t he interaction of two or more nil'
~c re ws on one shaft. This iB a problem whi ch is beco ming of importance in connec t.ion \lith the illc rease in pow or of
Ilirplane pO\'\'er plants an d with the fitting of more than one air screw on the Mrue shaft.
This li kewise is a problem which Just be approached experimentally- again through mode l research ch ecked up
by comparison with full scale tests. A beginning has been made on th iB most important and interesting problem ,
and we may e ~ pec t in a not distant future to find it brought within limits of control similar to thoae surronnding th e

so that the air screw, a.e it finda itself operating in a medium of continuously decrea.eing density, or lUI it finds itself
called upon for varying amounts of thrust or pull with varying angles of climbing flight, may be correspondingly adjusted
in order to give continuously the best results.
The problem is furth or complicated by the fact that the airplane itself needs a correlative adjustment. As we
have already seen, the one factor in aerial flight which remains sensibly constant under all conditions and at all altitudes of flight is the weigh t of the plane and its equipment. Th e vertical supporting force gained from th e reaction
of th e air must, therefore, be maintained constantly equal to thiB weight at least for th e conditions of horizon tal flight.,
while for climbing flight the weight will be divided and borne partly by the supporting planee and partIy by the air
screw. The problem of the economic use of power at varying altitudes and under varying angles of climbing fli ght
involves , th erefore , the foll owing chief elements:
. The weight of the plaoe.
The surface of the wings and their aerodynamic characteristics.
The angle of attack of the wings.
The speed.
The power developed by th e engine.
The revolutions of the air screw.
The area and form of th e hlades of th e air screw .
The pitch of the air screw.
Theee various factors react and interact in a most compl ex manner , and any attempt to discues the problem in
detail would carry us too far afield on the present occasion. We may note, however, that the angle of attack is th e
one feature about th e plane which may readily be varied, while th ere is no feature of the propulsive agent, th e ordinary
air screw, which admits of equally simple correlative variation. \Vhatis needed with regard to the air screw is , ind eed,
some means of realizing an adjUBtment correlative to the change in the angle of attack for the plane. To this end a
change of pitch iB most suitable, some means of varying, at the will of the pilot, th e pitch of the screw in order that,
with the fixed diameter and area of surface, and with the work available per royolution of th e engine as affected by th e
d ensity of th e air, the pitch may be so adjusted as to secure the number of revolutions bes t adapted to the economic
use of the power given out by the prime mover. This will th en insure th e thrust needed to overcome the resistance
of th e plane a t th e angle of attack and speed which taken con jointly will give th e lifting force needed to support th e
weight of th e plane, eith er in whol~ or in part, according as the plane is flying horizontally or climbing.
All of this somewhat complicated statement means simply that what is_wanted is an air screw with blades adjustabl e
for pitch . Such an air screlv m!l.y be realized by so pivoting the blades th-at th ey may be turned about a radial axis ,
thus changing th eir angle relati ve to the a ris of th e screw itself. Extreme changes of such a character resu lt io a very
wide variation of pitch from root to tip, an d in th e end will rl's ult in a serious loss of efficiency. There are, th ereforp ,
two problems i nvolved:
(1) The aerod ynamic problem of determining the best form and proportions of an air screw, the blades of whi ch
are intend ed to be pivotable in this manner, so that under the wid ely changing cond itions of (light which may be
met with, there may be effective operation and a well-sustained efficiency.
(2) The mechanical problem of so designing and bui ldi ng an air screw with adjustab le blades that it will mee t the
rigorous requirements im posed upon it by the exacting cond itions of airplanl' na . . -igation.
It is perhaps not too much to SOl)" that the first problem is a lrl'ady well in hand. We kn ow reasonably wel l what
forms and proportions to give to such an air screw, and if it was only a matter of design or of th e determin ation of form
and proportion th e problem cou ld hard ly be called outstanding.
As much can not be SOlid rega rding th e second prob lem . The practical co ~s tru ctiOl\ of an air screw with adj ustabl('
blades is not an easy matter. Several modes of constructiou bave been attempted but with only moderate BUCC<'68.
The problem is clearly defined, of th e highest order of importanc(', and is outstan d ing as one of th e applian c('E for wbi rh
the art of aerial navigation is definitely in waiting.
STADlLl"fY AKO CON TR OL.

The three fundamental requisitl's of an airplane are strength, movemen t, and stability with control. We hay!'
noted some of the probl ems arising under the req uirements of strength and mov ement or propulsion . We mny now

So it is with stability and control. If stability is carried to an extreme, then mobility and quickneea of maneuvering
are reduced and control in the sense of ready response is lacking. For military purPOBes, especially for ma.chines of
the fighting type, where mobility is of the highest importance, this would be a serious shortcoming, and hence such
machines can not be given too much stability in the ordinary sense of the term. On the other hand, for heavy machinre
of the bombing type, where mobility of evolution is not so vitally important, the margin of stllbility may be greater.
Going to a still further extreme, it is perfectly easy to build a safe, moderate speed family carriage sort of machine,
which will be stable and secure und er almost any conditions likely to develop . Such machines would be scorned by
fighting pilots, but when civil acronautice begins to come into its own after the war and under peace conditions, Ilnd
there comea a demand for safe machines for civil purposes, including family outiUgR for the week end from th o city to
the country or to th e seacoast, then we may anticipate a larger recognition of th e qualities making for safety and stability,
and we shall find machines provided having such characteristics and in practically any desired degree. IT ero again,
however, there will be degrees of choice, because it will be found that with too high a degree of stability what may
be termed the riding qualities of the plane will be poor, while with low stability the riding qualities may be much
smoother.
The general problem is, therefore, pretty well solved, so far as the groundwork is concerned. This d oes not mean,
however, that there is nothing furth er for us to learn in this connection. Th ere are man y problems of a detaile<l nature
inviting the stud ent of this fas cinating field of study, and thc solution of which will serve to round out and broaden
. our general grasp of the problem. In particular, we need further study on th e interaction betweon elements which
"insure stability and thooe which permit mobility and readiness of response to control agencies, to the end that '," 0
may control more effectively the combinations which may be dooired regarding stability and mobility of evolution.
Again, while the elements of control are well understood, there is room for furth er study as to the best means
of actually developing the control forces req uired and of applying them to the planc itsel f. These are partly aerodynamic and partly structural problems, each pha1le reacting m ore or lells on th e other .
One instance of problems of this character will serve to illustrate the type.
We know that an airplane is provided with rudd er surfaces of two l-inds, one to determine movement in a vertical
motion, up or down, and the other to determine horizontal motion, right or left. TIu t these motions, vertical and horizontal, aBBume that the plane itself is horizontal or sensibly· so. However, when a plane is circling on a steep spiral
or making a qui ck turn, it is inclined or "banked" in order to ayoid side slipping, until, in extreme cascs, the wings arc
nearly vertical, and frequently much more nearly vertical than horizontal. In such CIlSCS the fun ctions of these control
sen-icee are reversed. ThOBe which, with normal aspects, serve to produce movement right and left will now serve to
determin e motion rather in a vertical direction, and th08e which formerly served for movement up and down will now
serve to determine motion to the right or left. For intermediate anglee of bank each set o(con trol surfaces will gi\'e
control forces in both directions, up or down and right or left.
Now, it is by no mcaDB sure, having in view this double and interchanging fun ction between theee two sets of
surfaces, whether we have as yet realized the ultimate and best arrangement either 3S regards the surfaccs themselves
or th eir control by the pilot.
It seems d ecidedly probable that we have not and that some arrangemen t yet ~eJllains to be devised which will be
morc effcctive in the matter of this double and interchanging fun ction of control and simpler in its relation to the pilot.
AnM AlII ENT Al\'D INST U lJM ENTS.

Th erc still remain two large and important field8, rich in aeronautic problems. These are armament and instrumcnts. r shall attempt no more than the briefcst general reference to these two c1asscs of problems.
Thcl6c arising under the head of Ilrmament are, of conrse, strictly milita ry in charact~r ancl but little of interC.'lt
could. in any event, be said in a public add ress. Such problems relate naturally to the number, type, nnd size of guns
to bo earried, their mounting and special sights; bombs and devices for carrying, aiming, dropping, otc.; questions of
annor and protection of vital parts against gunfire or shrapnel bursts, etc.
ExprC68ed in their moot general terms these probleJlls resolve themselves into an attempt all nl ong th e lin e to

of money and human time and energy, and now represented by factories, machinery and equipment, finished product,
trained industrial organizations, human skill, and productive capacity.
The discUBBion of such a problem might well occupy our careful attention for the entire hour, but r can no more
than mention it here by name. We can, however, scarcely overexaggerate its importance, and the appointment of
importance commissions in England and in the United States for the study of the problems ariBing under this general
head is an evidence that their serious import is appreciated, and we may hopefully awaitsuitable measures of adjustment
against the day when we may a.guin turn our thoughts to the occupations of pence.
And so with all our problema-we can only look hopefully forward for the future to gi ve to us such meaaurce of
answer &8 our patience and study may merit.

'

The general problems enumerated in the preceding annual reports of the committee have
in part 'constituted the program of work during the past year. Progress has been made in the
scientific study and solution of these problems which are considered of immediate importance,
and they will be attacked on a larger scale by the committee with the increased facilities and
talent which will be available at the committee's research laboratory at Langley Field after
the war.
A. Stability as determined by mathematical investigation.-A number of isolated experiments
have been made upon the stability of airplanes, and the investigat.ion of the behR.vior of airplanes
in gusts has been continued, Part III appearing in this volume as Technical Report No. 27.
B. Airspeed meters and aeronautic instruments.- The officers in the Air Services of the Army
and Navy have to a large degree handled the development of airplane instruments in their
own organizations, and it has been necessary only in rare cases to conduct independent investigations looking toward the improvement of existing instruments. For example, the committee
investigated, through the subcommittee on navigation of aircraft, aeronnutic instruments, and
nccessories, a centrifugal type of tachometer designed by a Russian p, ngineer and nftor finding
that it possessed certain advantages over existing types, cnlled it to the attention of the officers
of the Air Service. Various 0 ther in teres ting ins trumen ts have been experimen ted upon by the
committee, among which was a vertical rate of climb indicator-sent to this count,ry from Holland
at the committeo's request. The development of the Zahm Venturi airsp eed meter has also
been carried on extensively by the Army authorities with a view to reducing the llCad resistan eo
of the pressure nozzle and its support. The committee has been active in suggesting inlprovoments and in proposing invostiga tions loo kin g to th e improvem ent of th ese instruments. These
investigations have in the main been carri ed on at th e Bureau of Standards.
C. Wing sections.-Extensive da ta exis t in relntion to th e aerodynamic properties of wing
sections, but in widely varying forms and in different publications. An effort hos been mad e by
th e committee to collec t all of this dll.ta in one compil a tion, wh ere it is presented in a uniform
mannor and in such a way as to make it r eadily avail able for the purposes of th e des ignin g
ongineer . In addition to da.ta already published, in vestigations have been conducted und ~ r
the direc tion of the committee upon new types of wing sections. Starting with th e sec tion
called "Durand 13," which was the section at tbe l 3-inch radius of one of the model propoll ers
us ed by Dr. Durand in obtaining the data give n in T0chnicn.l R eport No. 14, of th o third Rnnua l
report, much work has b een don e at the Massachuset ts Institu te of T ochn ology und er tho ausp ices

with a view to searching for forms having s pecially desired cha racteris ti cs, as, for ex aUl plo, a

supp orting surfaces are also being studied wi til a v iow to the determina tion of th eir 11l u t u nl

D . ElIqines ,- The most outstanding fea t m e in this field of o.eronautic development in this
country is the continuous improvement and P O\\-cr in crease of th e Liber ty 12. Tho firs t eight
months of th e y ear witnessed th e po wer per weight ro.tio, as expressed in pounds per horsepower output, improved from 2 to 1.85 when the engi.ne was operating on 68° B. standll.rd
gasoline at the standard reference speed. At maximum power this is further reduced to 1.70

pounds per horsepower. With special fuel, the figure for standard speed is further improved
to 1.75 and for maximum power to 1.65. This is a very creditable accomplishment and indicates that healthy development which can be based only upon a correct engineering foundation.
Of interest in tills connection is the note on CI Evolution of aircraft engines" in another part
of this report.
Liberty 12 production during the period from January to November 1, 1918, increased
from 1 engine per day to approximately 150 per day. At this rate of progress a daily production of 230 engines would be reached by the first of 1919. This demonstrates conclusively
that while the modern high duty aircraft engine necessitates a rather intricate mechanism and
calls for the utmost accuracy in many of its parts, it is quite possible to produce it in large
quantities with American manufacturing methods. It is, of course, essential that the design
should be made in the light of a proper consideration of the limitations and advantages of
American manufacturing methods if such production results as have been demonstra.ted a.re
to be expected.
Although the Liberty 8 WllS the original form of this development, it had been superseded
oy the l2-cylinder model, owing to the demand for increased power in two-place combat
machines. However, the development of and preparation for production of the 8 WllS undertaken
during the latter half of the year, in order to round out the program for combat machines.
The extensive use of Curtiss OX-5 engines for trafning was made possible by the satisfactory development and large quantity production of this model. The Hall-Scott A-7a was
used in some training planes during the early part of the year.
D-I. The manufacture of engines of foreign design has been materially advanced during
the year. The 300-horsepower Hispano-Suiza has been successfully developed and production
on it was started. This engine has given some remarkable results in specific power output
and thermal efficiency. Like the two Liberty models, it is intended for use largely on combat
airplanes.
The Hispano-Suiza l50-horsepower, as well as the Le Rhone 80-horsepower, and the Gnome
100-horsepower revolving engines, were produced in quantity, although the Gnome was used
only to a limited extent. All of these engines were used for training purposes.
D- 2. The comprehensive radiator research which was begun last year has been completed
in some of its phases . It is believed that the results will provo. an important aid to the
den>lopment of rational methods for des ignin g and placing airplane rudiators. Some rather
revolutionary results have been secured in the eITort to r educe the ratio of head resistance to
rudiation capacity. (See T eclmical Report No . 43 .)
Tbe complete mathematical analysis of the fundamentals of the transfer of heat to a moving
uir streaIll is under way, witb a view to the establishment of the co rrect concep tion of such
pbenomena. This analysis is being chec ked continuously against, t,he experimental values
obta~ed.

D-3. The vacuum chamber for testing engines under the conditions existing at high
altitudes, which was built at the Bureau of Standards during tbe past year, has been in COll tinuous usc in con nection with a comprehensiyc investigation of the properties of a large numher of hydrocarbon fuels. Much work bas also been carried out by way of invcstigatillg the
e~oct of variations in pressure, temp eratme, humidity, speed, compression, carburetion, ignitl~n, etc., on the performance of aircraft engi nes. Most of this work has been done with the
llispano-Suiza. 150 horsepower, n.lthough the Liberty 12 has also been under test. However,
tho latter pro\-ed ruther too In.rtre to handle conveniently in the present chamber. (See
Tochnical Reports Nos. 44, 45, 46,"'47, and 4 .)
.
. The altitud e cbamber hItS proved to be a very ma.terial aid in the higher development, of
&lI"craft engines and fuels. Therefore, two new chambers of larger size ure being constructed,
together with 8. nev,- laboratory building to house them. These chambers aro so interconnected
that. tbe totul refrigeration und exhausting capacity will be available for either, and it will be
P068 Ible to test water-cooled engines 11S large I1S 800 horsepower; also air-cooled engines up to
a bo ut 350 horsepower.

D-4. A somewhat simplified vacuum chamber has been built and used for the study of
the functioning of various types of carburetors under varying conditions of pressure, temperature,
and throttle opening. Much valuable data has been secured which has thrown light on the
problem of compensation for altitude. Two forms of automatic compensation devices have
been developed by its aid, which have given remarkable results under test. (See Technical
Reports Nos. 48 and 49. )
D-5. The problems of lubrication and lubricants have received much attention and many
comparative tests have been run of various oils in aviation engines mounted on a torque stand .
A special single' cylinder Liberty engine has been fitted with devices for the measurement of
temperature and pressure at all of the important bearing surfaces, and this should furnish data
of marked value in the study of this problem.
At the same time, a comprehensive research has been conducted in the laboratory, having
for its object the determination of more exact concep tions of the relationships existing between
the various properties of lubricants. Some interesting results have been secured which tend to
show the inadequacy of present specification methods.
D-6. The development of fuels productive of maximum power output, combined with
high thermal efficiency, has received attention and much has been learned. '£he results have
served as the foundation for a new series of specifications for the several grades of gasoline best
adapted to the requirements of different branches of the air service.
The properties of many mixtures of gasoline, benzol, alcohol, etc., have been investigated,
as have those of a number of hydrocarbons which have been chemically modified. Gasolinebenzol mixtures and "hydrogenated JJ benzol have shown interesting results, by permitting
higher compression pressures and temperatures with resultant increase in power output. (See
Technical Report No. 47.)
In connection' with the fuel research, a comprehensive investigation of the phenomena of
flame propagation and combustion has been inaugurated and special apparatus constructed for
securing accurate experimental data.
D-7 . The work on ign ition problems has been largely con~entrated on the perfection of the
spark plug and the study of the current characteristics of magnetos and battery systems. A
new porcelain hilS been developed by the Bureau of Standards' Ceramics Section, which has
greater mechani cal, th erm al, and electrical strength than any that had previously been produceJ,
either in this country or abroad. This constitutes a marked advance in the art, and the formula
of this porcelain has been adopted by a numb er of mallufacturers .
The I,ork on current cha racteristics of different ignition systems has been of great importance in connection with the efIort to determine the exact propert.ies of ign ition sparks "hicb
insure the most effective ignition with the least energy expenditure . This research is as yet
incomplete.
T he effect of the atL"(ilim'y gap, of differing elec tri cal charac teristics, on the restarting of
fouled spark plugs is under investigation, Although not yet co mpleted, it ho.s been shown that,
the correctly designed auxiliary gap is a very valuable aid in overco ming the efTects of defective
carburetion and cylinder I u briCiLtion.
D-8 . 'l'he problem of supercharging aeronauti c engines, in order that the power out.put
shall not fall off with the atte nuation of the atmosphere at inCl'enseJ altitudes, bas beell the
subj ect of much experimental development. The results have been yery encouraging, a power
output having been obtained at 14,000 feet elevation whicb was equal to that at sea leycl.
Also, it has been demonstrated th at the power outpu t can be increased some 30 per cent at sealevel without serious difficulty.
The solution of thi s problem will result in the attainm ent of much greater speeds at high
altitudes than those of present airplanes. As most of th e long-distance fly ing will be at high
altitude, the importance of this problem is evident. The severnl interesting typos of apparatus
are under intellsive development.

E. PropelZers.-The tests of air propellers described in Technical Report No. 14 of the
third annual report have been continued during the past year, and the results are given in
Technical Report No. 30. In these tosts modol propellers were solocted with a view to broadening the field covered in the previous investigation. A pitch groater than that proviously
used ha.s been experimented upon, togother with varying degrees of blade offset, but with a shape
similar to ones previously used. Several propellers of tho first series but with less camber
have also boen tested. In addition to these now models, tests have been made upon the standing thrust and power of all those proviously tested as well as the brake effect (negativo thrust
at low revolutions) of some of these. Some : special oxperiments have also been made, one
,
using two propellers in series revolving in opposite directions; another upon a model constructed
in such a manner that' the blade angles could be varied throughout a considerable range, thus
furnishing some data upon the subject of the variable pitch propeller. Experiments have also
~,een carried out upon model propellers designed an.d submitted by the Army and also by individual inventors where the design submitted seemed to offer some promise of advancement in
the development of air propellers. The committee is extending the investigation of morlel
propellers to include extensive determinations of the . mu tual rea ctions or in terforenco upon
adjacent structures, such as fuselage or wings.
Appar~tus and equipment have been made available which enable free flight determinations to be made upon full-sized airplane propeller performance. It is intended to develop
from this work definite relations and coefficients which will enable the designer to make the
transition with accuracy from model tests conducted in wind tunnels to actual full-size performance. An analytical investigation of exist.ing experimental results on model propellers is
in progress with a view to making available to the designing engineer definito and accurate
data upon which t.o base the calculations of performances of aerial propellers. Theoretical
considerations have also been discussed by Dr. de Bothezat, who has d evelop ed formulas which
add materially to the data atready available for this purpose. (Sec T echnical Reports Nos. 29
and 30.)
F. Form of airplane.-During the past year there has b een no further uniform investigation of this subject. Numerous isolated t ests have been made whi ch do not, however, add
much to the general knowledge of the subject. Among the large numb er of inventions examined
by the committee during the past year have been many proposals 1.0 1' variation in the form of
fl.irplanes, but none has contained points of material value in assisting the development of the
SCIence.
G. Ra.dio communication.-Th e p rob lems of intercommun ication between nirplan cs nod
between airplanes and ground have been developed and have proved of greut assistance to tho
military and naval air forces. Methods of intercommunication, both by telegraph and tolephone, have been perfected. Considerab le experimen tation has beell carril\d on at the Buroau
of Standards relative to securing a wind-driven generating unit giving constfl.n t power output
at all airplane speeds.
H. Meteo rology in relat 1:01/. to acronantics.- Considerahle wo rk has been dOllo by the suheO ll1mittee 011 the rolation of the tltD1osphore to a eronauti cs, aidl~d by the staff ant! fa cilities of

Besides the more general problems the following probloms of a physical rather than an
aeronautical nature are of particular interest, and under same the following progress is noted:
A. Noncorrosive materials.-The attompt to prolong the lifo of iron and steel parts in sorvice
by protecting them against corrosion has led to tho investigation of many materials and processes for coating. These protective materials fall into three general classes: (1) Metallic
coatings; (2) coatings in which the iron to be protected IS itself converted at the surface into
SOme inert compound; and (3) organic coatings, such as paints, varnishes, enamels, etc. The
organic coatings have received no attention by this committee, but those mentioned in (1)
and (2) have been extensively investigated through the subcommittee on noncorrosive materials .
. ' The metallic coatings include all the Common metals and alloys which can be applied to
steel, namely, zinc and aluminum, which are electropositive to iron, tin, lead, "terne" and
other lead alloys, copp~r, nickel, cobalt brass, bronzo, and silver, all of which are electronegative to iron. In the case of the iron compounds the iron at the surface is convertod into
an oxide or to some other compound, after which it has been found advisable to give the pieco
an oil fini sh.
The electrochemical effects, the application of the coatings of the various types, and th e
resulting microstructure has been closely studied . Methods of preparing the articles for
coatings and methods of testing the coatings have also been devoloped.
B. Flat and cambered surfaces.-A number of reports have been obtained relative to tests
conducted at the National Physical Laboratory of Great Britain, which contain valuablo
information on stabilizer, elevator, and rudder fulS. The committee has also undertaken a
further study of combinations of control surfaces, with 0. viow to the determination of the
most effective methods of steering and of control generally.
C. Terminal connections.-No comprehensive investigation of this subject has been undortaken, and the isolated experiments made by the industry have not add ed ma.teria.lly to the
knowledge of the problem.
D. Oonstructive materials.-D-l. A continuation of the work don e at the Bureau of Standards through the agency of the subcommittee on standardization and investigation of materials
for aircraft upon the development of substitutes for linen airplan e fabrics has brought onto
the market a type of cotton fabri c equal in quality, if not superior, to the conventional linell
fabrics. (Sec Report No. 36.) This development work has been carri ed on in conjunctio ll
with the manufacturers, who have materially assisted in the realization of th e prog ress thus
far obtained. The subj ect of the fastening of the fabri c to the airplane fmm e hus also beon
investigated, and consider8.ble improveiOent has resulted in the processes previously used.
Extensive experiments are being conducted with the object of supplying the airplfl.De design er
with formulae and curves which will facilitate the designing of airplane fabri cs for new airplan('s,
and it is intended to place fabri c on the same basis as other constm ctio nal materials used in th e
airplane stmcture. The study of the use of silk fabri c has also progressed with a ,-iew of PI',)'
viding a reserve material, sho uld the supply of cotto n fabrics fail as did tho supply of lint'n
fabrics. The study of balloon hbrics hilS comprised mainly the investigation of rubber films,
as it is definitely known tha.t the deterioration of that part of the ma teri al is such that investigl\tions with tl. view to improvement in the cotton cloth are not warranted at this time. (Soc
Report No. 39.)
D- 2. A considerab le amount of experim ental work hus been c.ond ucted at t.he Bureau of
Standards by the subcommittee on steel construction for aircraft and the subcommittee Oll
light alloys upon ,arious alloys of aluminum and o ther light metallic clements, as well as upon
heat-treated steels, with a view to the securing of uniform physical properties suitable for th e
purposes of airplane construction.
D-3. A survey has been made of the state of art of the applica ti on of pneunlatic tire~ to
a.irplanes and it is intended to make a further investigation of this subject.

E. Generation of buoyant gases for lighter-tha7lrair craft.-Experiments of a confidential
nature have been conducted by the Army and Navy upon the problem of the generation of
hydrogen for observation balloons, scouting dirigibles, and other lighter-than-air craft. Investigations have been made as t.o the possibilities of hot air for this purpose. Attention is invited
to Technical Reports Nos. 40 and 41, which describe work carried on at the Bureau of Standards.
F. Nomenclature for aeronautics.-The standardization of aeronautical nomenclature has
heen continued by the committee. The latest revision is contained in Technical Report No. 25 .
The subcommittee having this subject in Chitrge has effected coordination of views betw een the
Military and Naval Air Services of the United States and the aeronautical authorities of Grellt
Britain.
G. Specifications jor aeronautical materials.-During the war, when the Army and Navy
were the only consumers of airplanes and their equipment, it was only proper that the Army
a.lid Navy should prepare the specifications for aeronautical materials. The committee, however,
offered valuable advice to the military and naval authorities in connection with this subject.
H. Bibliography of aeronautics.-The Smithsonian Institution, in 1909, published a bib1iography of aeronautics. The committee has extended this bibliography up to December 31,
1916, /llld this is in proccs:; of publication I1S a separate report. The committee proposes to
keep this subject up to date by annual puhlications in the future .
r. CoUection, ret.-ision, and issuance of l·eports.-This phase of the committee's activities is
trellted under the subj ect of the Office of Aeronautical Intelligence.
J. Limitation of size of airplanes.-Dr. de Bothezat, of the committee's technical staff, has
lllade a serious study and has contributed a valuable article on the subject.

$75,000; in tJI, $325,000: Provided, That the Secretary of War fa authorized and directed to furniah office epace to the
Nat.ional Advisory Committee for Aeronautice in euch governmental building or buildings aa may be doomed mOllt
appropriate for the conduct of the work of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautice.
CONCLUSION.

The committee believes that the Unitod States are destined to and should rightfully take
the lead in the development of aviation for commercial as well as military purposes. Thero are,
however, many problems in aviation which are still unsolved, to which r eferonce is made in this
report. Other problems will arise. The committee therefore emphasizes the ' need for continuous scientific rese~rch and experimentation in aeronautics. The great delays in getting an
effective air force into action during the war were due in no smail part to the lack of a proper
scientific and technical foundation before the war.
The committee believos th at it would be wise for the country to sustain an air service
suitable for its immodiate needs, but not a large for ce, as steady progress may be expected in the
design of aircraft, and tho civil and military sorvices will require constantly in time of poace,
. 'but more especially in time of \var , only the most improved types.
Looking to the hoalthy development of aeronautics in America for all purposos, the committee strongly recommends :
First. That support be given to the committee in its program for the furth er scientific study
of the problems of flight, to which reference is made in this report.
Second. That a continuing comprehensive governmental policy regarding the construction
of aircraft for both civil and military purpoeos bo adopted, and that comparatively small ordors
be apportioned among competont aircraft manufacturers, thus assuring the existence of a
nucleus of an aircraft industry capable of prompt and satisfactory response to military needs when
the demand arises.
Third. That a plan of cooperation be formulated and approvod whereby aviators ill the
military and naval services of the United States may r eceive continuous training in long-distance
flying, and at the same time render effectivo service to the Nation by assisting in the work of the
nir mail snrvico.
Fourth. That legislation be enacted for tho regulation of civil aerial nllvigation, the issuance
of liconses to pilots, inspoction of machines, uses of landing fields, etc., and that such legislation
bo so drawn as to effectivoly onco urage the development of commercial uses of aoronautics in th o
United States, and at the same Limo .guide the devolopment as for as practicahle along such
lines as will render immediate and effective military service to the Natioll in ovent of war.
Fifth. That the estimlttos submitted by tho War, Navy, and Pest Office Dopartmcnts bo
ginll full consideration with a viow to placing America foremost in the developmont of n,iutioll
for all purposes.
R espectfully submitted.
