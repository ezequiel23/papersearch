The publication of the following details is due to the desire of the editor to have the problems of soaring flight treated on the occasion of the Rhone Soaring ~light

Contest.

In the

main,.these problems are only connected with matters which are
.,
more or less known.

For anything wtiich nay be new, I am indebt-

ed to frequent talks with G,”Madelung and A. Betz, who have giv......

en me their permissiori to publish these remarks.
By soaring flight - in contrast with gliding flight - is
meant motorless flight without 10S8 of height.

According to the

laws of the mechanics of flight, two sources of energy are available for soaring flight.

One is, air cuzrents having an upward

trend; and the other is, irregularities in.the natural wind,
Under the iatter head we can dis,tin~isk between two effective
forms:

(1) Great fluctuations in the strength (and also direc-

tion) of the wind, lasting several seconds; (2) The rapid fluctue.tion in wind direction which is commonly described as “turbulent
wind, “

The fluctuations of

long

duration can only

be utilized by

effecting considerable changes in the velocity and height of the
machine.

For instance, by, in one single =mst, climbing at the

expense of relative velocity., and theg~ in the calm which followsj

the pressure on the wings, in a downward current depressed to decrease the pressure.
The fluctuations of short duration, on the other hand, can be
utilized without any substantial change in velocity of the e.g.
of the machine.

As A. i3etzhas shown in a very

instructive arti-

cle in this journal in 1912,* useful effect is available in sufficiently great fluctuations in i~ind direction even with rigid
and non-warped aeroplane nings.

With elastically mounted or flex-

ible wings, the force obtained from changes tn wind direction, if
these be sufficiently great, may assume perceptible proportions.

When we now come to the question of which of these sources of

rate-mainly, they *take ad~-antage of risirig ai~ ,,.
—.
,.., currents.

Rising

air currents are always to be found in uneven country when a wind ~
is ?o].owing. Tiley are also caused over the plains by meteorological influences.

For their flying practice birds naturally seek the

rising air currents, and as these are frequently not of very ~~eat
in
exten~...i
_s~acece, the birds hav~ to circie in orde~ to rsiflain
the rising air currents.

By observing the soaring of birds of

prey one may frequei~tly see that they suddenly lose height and
then conmlenceto fiap their wings, continuing in flapping flight
until they are seen suddenly to rise.
they recoilmence to soar.

From this moment onwards

They have again found their rising cur-

rent which they had previously lost.

The soaring seagulls near a

steamer make use of the air deflected by the steamer and comii~ence
to flap as soon as, for soriereason or otk.er, they have to leave
.
their favorable position.
That a bird intentionally r:lakes se of gusts does not appear
u
to occur generally.

In order to do so it would kave constaiitly

to inake jumps up and down, which, .SOfar as I am aware, it has not
been observed to do.

On the other hand, it does not appear unlike-

Iy that many birds utilize the rapid.fluctuations in the wind beProbably, ho’n~ides,

ever, these forces suffice-in no case to cov”er ~fie’&fi”%i2e’

flying, so that the axiom “no soarirlgwithout a wind with an up.

In the case of human soaring flight, all the previously mentioned possibilities of making-use of the energy in the air hold
good in principle.

The fish-tail effect, as I will call it for

the Sake of brevity, may ‘possibly be utilized by a suitable form
of flexible ~ving-sectionsj although I should”advise experiments
with crewless (unbemannten) models.

It is quite probable that the

wind flu~.tuations, which such wings vmuld be designed. to utilize,
might frequently not be of such magnitude as to have a perceptible
effect,

In view of the probably inconsiderable gain to be expect-

ed one would not like to risk the uncertainty of the flying qualities of such a flexible aerofoil, which might easily lead to a useless,

or even dangerous, machine.

A crewless model, on the other

hand, could more easily be sacrificed.
The utilization of great mind fluctuations is a“question of
the skill of individual fliers.

It is conceivable”now and then to

extract a slight gain from these, but too much should not be expected from this source.

There then remains, as the most

important

help to human soaring flight, air currents with an upward trend.
If it is desired to utilize to the fullest extent rising air
currents, one must strive to build machines with a slo~ rate of

Hankin (Proc. Cambr. Phil. SOC.,
20 (1921), pp. 219-227), according
to which soaring by turbulent mind only is said to be possible when
the earth is strongly heated, as occurs in the trop$cs, Dr. Hankin
describes observations of birds, dragon-flies and flying fish.

time, the upwazd slope of the mind is greater than the best gliding angle of the machine.

On a slope which is steeper than the

best gliding angle of the machine, it is moreover possible to soar
in winds whose velocity is smaller than that of the lowest gliding
speed of the machine, provided the rate of ascent of the wind is

in this case soar out horizontally into the free air and will obviously rise in doing so.

It would, however, in time get outside

the region of the ascending wind, but if the slope

has sufficient

breadth the machine can be pointed diagonally to the slope and pass
across it at the same height or climbing slowly, the sideways displacement giving sufficient speed for soaring.

This method of fly-

ing can often be observed on seagulls over the beach.

Under simi-

lar conditions the method should be possible of execution by human
beings.
The conditions for the smallest possible rate”of descent can
be formulated.

To begin with, the gliding angle c
