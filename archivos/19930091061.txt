PREFACE.

The work here outlined was done to levelop a suitable speed nozzle for the fll'St few
thousand airplane made by the United State during the recent war in Europe, and to furni h
a basis for more mature instruments in the future. Forty thousand of these nozzles were
ordered by the Government, and 12,000 were made before the cessation of hos tilitie .
The preliminary experiments were made by Me sr . L. Ofenstein and William H. Gornal ;
the later ones by Messrs. L. H. Crook, G. J. Chaillet, and R. H. Smith; the illustrations were
al'r.a nged by Messr . L. Thoms and S. S. Rathbun; all aeronautical a sistants in the Construct ion Department, Washington Navy Yard.
The manuiacture and inspec tion of the first nozzles for the Government were upervised ,
respectively, by Naval Constru ctor William McEntee, U. S. N., for the r avy, and Maj. C. E.
Mendenhall, R. C. A . S., for th e Army. Their tests supplied some of the tables here given for
the performance, in laboratory and field , of the final s tandard nozzles joined to adequate
pressure gauges.
R equirements.-To provide a suitable pre sure collector for aircraft speed meters an effort
wa made, early in 1917, to develop a speed nozzle which should be waterproof, powerful ,
unaffected by slight pitch and yaw, rugged and ea y to manufacture, and l.miform in structure
and reading, so as not to r equire individual calibr ation. Existing nozzles had not all these
properties. Some exerted feeble pre sure, others were low and costly to make, and none were
waterpr oof. For example the nozzles shown in Figures 1 and 2. though valuable under favo r~
able conditions, are neither waterproof nor powerful ill action.
PITOT-VENTURI NOZZLE No.1.

Oeneral jeatures.-Figures 3 and 4 give the outward appearance and structural detailR
of nozzle No.1, made in the spring of 1917. A single casting, fixed by it flange to a strut,
comprises two laterally-downward sloping ducts, one terminating in a mall pitot elbow, the
other ending transversely in the till'oat of a do-able-eone venturi tube. In normal working,
the air blows straight into the pitot mouth, generating therein fu ll impact pressure; also it

blows s traight through the venturi, generating in its thro at a sucti on m any times as intense as
said impact pressure. The pressure and suction are transmitted through their r espective
ducts to the two nipples at the strut, and thence through tubing to a differ ential pressure
gauge on the pilot's instrument board. The gauge is so graduated as to give tlJ e true speed
through air a t normal density .
Theory. - The gauge of a pitot-venturi is actua ted by the differ ence of the pressures at the
pitot mouth and the venturi throat . The first pressure increases indefini tely with the speed ;
the second decr eases at first nearly as the square of the speed, then somewhat asymptotically
toward zero. An adequate theory should give true mathematical expression t o those pressures.'
For all speeds the total pressure in the pitot mouth may be written , for adiabatic compression ,

of continuity. It teaches that, for all airplane speeds for which the air com pre sion is negligible,
the mean 'velocity through the tube varies inversely as the cross- ectional ar ea; also that the
ehange of pressure along a stream line is proportional to the change of the velocity square.
This theory may be valid for the flow entirely within a suitably designed tube, but indicates
nothing a to the speed of entry or pres ure of exit of the air. It is obvious that the speed of
entry at the front cone depends on the suction outside the base of the rear cone.
Design data.-To employ experiment in lieu of theory, a short venturi of u ual in ide proportions, as shown from a to b in Figure 5, Was taken as a tUFting btL_c. This was lengthened
by inserting in its rear a paper cont) which could be shortened by clipping off successive egments. The Te ulting curve given in the diagram ~bows that the suction steadily increased
with length of cone up to an elongation of 3 inches, after which the gain was imma terial. '1 his
3-inch extension Was adopted in the fmi hed design. Th e base of the cone wa now flared
t.rumpetwise by adding wax and thus acquired 10 per cent greater suction. The front cone
was not improved but rather injured by lengthening or flanging. '1'able II portrays the los
of suction a the front cone is lengthened ; also the gain as the r eal' cone is leng thened.
Having thus found suitable main climen ions for the tube, some attent.ion was given to
the throat and side duct leading therefrom. A cylindrical throat all acro s the duct gt.ve
mu ch less suction than one extending aft only half acros the duct. A large duct g!1ve slightly
Ie suction than a small one, but had the adv~"ntage of being waterproof. This waterproofness
is illustrated by Table III, presenting experimental data whieh ahow the pre sure required to
burst clean water films from the ends of brass tubes of yarious size '.

],ianufttcture.- For cbeapness, speed, and accuracy in making tbesc tubes, three processes
were tried- die casting, copper depo iting, sand casting witb sub equellt reaming. Samples
so produced and all satisfactory are shown in Figure 3,6, 7. The die castings were to be
made of aluminum or tin alloy at the rate of four per minute with one die, all true to 1/ 1000
inch inside, and at a remarkably low cost. But after sending a few good samples the
manufact.urer canceled his contract, owing to the press of other work and tbe cost of perfec ting :t suitable die. The samples were die cast in two parts, telescoping toget,b er near where
the single duct joins the venturi. The sancl-ca ·t nozzle is accurately reamed in its venturi
part and where its duct enters the throat; at the flange end it is t9.pped for nipples, drilled for
clamp screws, plugged at the outer end of its duct,s. The copper-deposited tube:; were accurate
without reaming, and had the advantage of resi ting ca water better than the cast tubes,
which, for lightness, were made of aluminnm. The copper nozzle was made in three parts
soldered together- a cast flange, the pitot mout.h and duct, the venturi and its duct. The
pitot and the venturi eaeb was formed by copper plating soft metal cores wbich had been cas t
in very acc urate teel dies and could easily be melted out of their ('opper coats. '1'h e aluminum
lJnd the copper nozzle each weighed about 12 ounces, the latter having much thinner walls.
Smaller sizes were made suhsequently, partly for ligh tne s, partly for lessening the air resistance.
Rut these could not be cast all in one piel:e. Hence tlle ducts were mad e of nunow-drfiwn
tubcs joining the venturi and flange as harl been done with the earliest experimental nozzleR
m ade during this study.
Oalibration for nead-on velocity.-The nozzle No .1 was calibrated first in the wind t,unnel ,
then in fin airplane flying over a measured course. In the tunnel the tube to be tested was placed
beSId e the tandard J avy pitot in a uniform wlI1d held at various fi}{ed speeds. The diiTerential pre sur es in both nozzle were read on alcohol manometers. The true speed was a sumed
to be given by the standard tube on application of formula (2). The differential pressure
r eadings of the venturi-pitot were then plotted figainst the computed speed, and used to graduate the gauge of the speed meter. In the field test readings were taken of the speed-meter
gauge, the all' conditions and Lhe time ovp-r a measured course with and against a lIght breeze.
The gauge readings were then plotted agamst the airp1ane's speed as computed from the course
ob ervations. The error made in ignoring the air's compressibility may be judged from Table 1.
CalIbratIOn data for graduating the pressure gauges of air-speed meters using noz~le J.J o. 1
are given m Table IV. It wa formed from careful tests, in the 4' by 8' tunnel, of several
copper and everal aluminum tu be , at all speeds from 30 to 150 nliles an hour. It indicates
that the pressure dliTerence increa es closely as the square of the speed from 30 to 130 miles an
hour, after whicb it increase less rapidly, if the Navy standard pitot be true. The standard
pitot-static nozzle of the United States avy differs slightly from the Britisb ·standard in size
and sbape, bu t gives the same differen tial pressure a t all speeds from zero to more than 160
mil es an hour.

T est for waterproofness.- To a cer tain whether in use the tubes would have their sid e duct
coated wjth a water film, they were first cleaned of oil, then expo ed to a spray of hydrant
water in the wjnd tU1lnel in an air current of 40 miles an hour. In such tests nozzle No.1
nevel' dogged; the nozzles of other makes, wjth fine static hole, always clogged by the formation of a film over tbe apertures. Reports from sea test also aifu'm th~Lt in pr acti ce a film never
forms over the seven-sixteenth-inch duct.
Resisumce and absorbed power.-Tbe air resistance and horsepower absorhed are given in
Figure 8 for nozzle No.1 and a sm aller one of similar make to be described presently. These
m eas urements are to be extended to bigher speeds. They .indicate that tbe resistance increases
slightiy less than as the square of th e speed; also that the large tube bas r ather m or e than
twiee the r esiatance of the sm aller. This item is not negligible for sm all airplane of highest
speed . At 70 miles an hOUT the mall nozzle No.1 absorbs 0.07 horsepower, the large one 0.16.
MISCELLANEOUS AIRSPEED NOZZLES.

Incidental to the work on No.1, various ot]1er forms of speed nozzle were devc1oped. These
h an for salient features convenionce or sui tability of pln.cement, or lightness, or minimum
air resistance, etc.
Gooseneck nozzle No. 1.-Figures 9 and. 10 illustrate a modifien form of nozzle No. 1
designed to protrude forward of a wing stru t so as to encounter les disturbed air, have less
resi tanco, and still have waterproofnes and great suction power. The impact or pitot nozzle is close to the strut and joins the up-pointing pressure nipple at the top of the base
casting which is Ia hed fast vvith cord. The venturi duct rises vertically from the venturi
throat, then turns sharply aft some 2 feet, running horizontally through the protruding horn
of the base ca ting to the down-pointing suction nipple. The pitot reads the same whether
near to or far befor e the stru t . The venturi, to e cape b lanketing, must be placed with its
b ase about 2 feet before a 2 by 6 inch strut. The diagram in Figure 10 shows how the venturi
loses suction as its base approaches the strut nearer than 2 feet.
The Foxboro venturi-pitot.-Some weeks after the test of the foregoing tube, the F oxboro Co.
presented for test the gooseneck venturi portrayed in Figure 11. This nozzle has the merit
of lightness, scant resistance, and ample suction power. It consi t of an ordinary forward
protruding venturi whose front cone is covered with a thin tube of sligh tly larger' diameter,
leaving between it and the underlip of the cone a crescent-shaped opening. The under cavity
r eceives the air inipact and transmits it around the neck of the cone to the small impact pipe
running thence to the pressure gauge. The suction pipe connects with the venturi throat in
the usual way. Besides the pos ible film in the venturi duct, two other feature of this nozzle
are, (1) it is blanketed by the strut; (2) a heavy spray can ea ily cau e a flooding of the duct
of the pitot part.
mall-size nozzle No. 1 type.- Figure 12 portrays a nozzle of about half t he linear size of the
0 .1 , made by the 'ame manufacturer, more especially for the United States .Al'my, and intended
to have less weight and air re istance. It was made in the latter part of 1918 under the direction
of Maj. C. E. Mendenhall, R . C. A.
The venturi is a reamed bronze casting; the supporting
base is of stamped heet teel ; the remainder is of drawn tubes bent through the base and soldered therein. The ducts, though loping laterally downward, as in nozzle No.1, are not
waterproof at all airplane speeds, because their lower ends can be clogged wjth a water film,
not perhap when new and oily, but certainly after aging.
By trial it was found th at a film over the venturi duct can withstand a steady re ultant
pressure of 0.44 of an inch of water. Thi is 4 per cent of t he differential pressure reading at
60 miles an hour, 16 per cent of the reading at 30 miles an hour. A li ke error may be caused
by a film at the mouth of the small-bore pitot part. The two films will usually con pire, thus
practically doubling the error due to either . When subjected to a gentle spray of water in
the wind tunnel at 45 miles an hour this nozzle promptly gave readings false by over 10 per
cent, due to a film in the venturi duct, and a like error due to a film over the pitot mouth. A

heavier spray completely filled the pitot duct and its connecting tube, a 'm ishap which in practice would cau e an indefinitely large error. No exact data are at hand to indicate how severe
the dou ing of the pitot is over rough water or in a rainy s1.7. It must be remembered that
the impact of a raindrop is 00 times that of the arne volume of tandard air.
The readings of this instrument, compared with simultaneous readings of the larger nozzle
o. 1, are given in Table VIII, and indicato that for all speeds from 60 to 130 miles an hour a

Figure 13 shows a mall-size nozzle of o. 1 type made by the Copper Product Co. A
tetrapod ca t-brass flange upports the usual copper-deposited pitot and venturi portions, the
pitot stem being of treamline form and covering the venturi stem, which is a mall round tube.
Both stems are soldered to the venturi neck and to the bras flang. At 60 miles an hour
this nozzle reads the same to within a fraction of 1 mile, a the ail' tream varie in pitch and
yaw through 10° positi e and negative.
Small F1'ench-type single tMoa,t pitot-Vl'nt1lri .- Figure 14 shows a French pi tot-venturi
which normally has a cylindrical tube too slightly flared in its real', and which, in the prC'sent
tudy, wa. flared like that in nozzle No.1, to ascertain the increase of head so obtainable.
Table IX gives the suction readings for both the original venturi part and the more Hared
form, and indicates that the lat.tor shape is 50 pel' cent. the more effectivo. Further increase
of flare did not improve the suction.

The French instrumont was composed of many parts, the stom being a folded brass shoet
oloered t,o it. uppoJ'ting flange tlnd bolted to a lug on the ventmi, while the latter element
wa" compo cd of four eparate parts. A similar instrument, developed in thi study, with
iL body, . tern, and Oange cast in one piece, is !';hoi\l1 in Figure 15, and weigh!,; slightly over
2 ouner. Its stem was int.ende'd to have a form of minimum r('sistance. Both ill truments
have detachable front cone , aud both have "Very fine ducts, hence are noL water-proof. Their

for a speed nozzle ",ho. C' imywt mouth hould be as u ual, but who e other memh('[" hould
give the true bn.rometric pn'ssW'e of the undi. turb('d air. To thaI. end a thin-wtLlled Y2 -inch
cylinder, proyided wit~ the usuitl f(; -inch side duct was suh. tiLuted for the' vcntW'i part of
speed nozzle No. 1. By coning its rear end inward or out\\-ard, the cylinder could he made to

A high-suction venturi.- To furnish power for a gyroscope there has becn need for a nozzle
giving tronger suction than is conveniently attainable with ordinary nozzle' . The 11eeo WiI '
met by attaching a tiny single-throat ventW'i at each of two opposite tip of a small windm ill
having hollow 'pokes joined to a hollo v haft, the venturi axe pointing in the direction of
the relative air velocity. In a vind of 60 miles an hour the uction wa 52 incho ' of water, with
zero volume delivery, and les a the volume delivery increased. The uction ,,-as, in fact,
about twice that of a good double-throat flared venturi, and ahout [out" times that of it well
flarecl single-throat one, as may be inferred from Table IX, X.
DOUBLE-THROAT AIRSPEED

For slow-speed air-craft a nozzle more powerful than the single-throat venturi seemed
desirable. It wa thorefore sought to render water-proof t1 double-throat vonturi of known
design.

Hooded double-throat pitot-vent~L1'i.-To render the Badin speed nozzle waterproof, while still
retaining much of its suction power, it was transformed into the instrument depicted in Figures
18 and 19. In principle it now consi ts of an ordinary double-tlu'oat venturi reversed in
uirection, its smaller end inserted in a dry-air ci tern, its larger end capped with a tee-tube
which serves both to increase the suction and to shield the venturi from r ain.
The wind driving into the rectangular slot of the cistern strikes a wire screen and dashplate
de igned to remove the raindrops; thence pas es upward, then forward through the regular
venturi ; thence into the tee pipe, where it divides right and left, finally emerging from rectangular lots at the rear thereof. The impact pre ure is collected from a nipple at the top of the
cist ern, as shown. A tube leading from the tlu'oat of the smaller venturi collects the suction.
The base of the instrument is provided with lugs for attachment to a pole protruding from the
car or rigging of a dirigible.
Figure 19 pre ent the calibration curve of this instrument for all speeds from 20 to 70 miles
an hour; also that of the standard die-ca t nozzle No.1, for comparison. In both the resultant
pre sure difference varie directly as the square of the velocity at speeds from 30 to 70 miles an
hour, the highe t available in the 8' x 8' tunnel.
Table XI presents the indicated speeds in a 40-mile wind at a).l incidences in pitch and yaw
from 0° to 10° positive and negative. The yaw column indicates no variation in speed for
changes of incidence from 0° to 10°; the pitch column indicates an increase of less than onefourth mile per hour as the nose of the instrument is canted up 7° and a decrease of Ie s than
1 mile per hour as it is canted down 7°. This latter variation is doubtle s due to the blanketing of the rectangular slot of the cistern, aud might be obviated by lowering the slot.

The tee-cap alone in a 40-mile wind was found to exert a constant suction as it pitches and
yaws 8° either way from the head-on direction. This in a measure corroborates the re ults
published by Drs. Finzi and Soldati, in 1902, in their pamphlet "Esperimenti Sulla Dinamica
dei Fluidi," in which they show that the pressure di tribution over the rear surface of a cylinder

held squarely acros the wind is constant. They gave no readings, however, for a cylinder held
oblique to the wind. The present tudy indicates also that the pre SUl'e eli tribution all around
a cylinder is practically the same when the axis is normal to the wind as when at 0° or 85°
thereto. This fact wa; noted when using a perforated cylinder as an incidence meter in the

A few of these instrument were manufactured and ins talled on motor balloon. Later,
owing to the cost and difficulty of uniform manufacture, they were di card ed in favor of the
single-throat peed nozzle o. 1 coupled with a delicate pre ure gauge.
Oonclusion .- A the purpo c of this study was mcrely to develop a practical waterproof
speed nozzle for immediate use, a summary of the general properties of such tube, n eel not
be given, further than has been done incidentally in the text. Such general properties have
been detailed many times by earlier experimenters. It um ce to noLe that the large- ize
nozzle o. 1 i waterproof and that it gives true reading at all ordinary angles of incidence
and at all speeds up to more than 2 mile per minute_ For very swift machines of moderate
po\yer a nozzle of less resi tance must b e used, even though not waterproof. But with some
attention to tructural detail it i practicable to make both tube give true speed r<"acling.
When joined in turn to the same pres ure gauge.
