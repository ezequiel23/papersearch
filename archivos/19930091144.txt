THE DESIGN OF WIND TUNNELS AND WIND TUNNEL PROPELLERS.
By EDWAR.D P. WARNER, F. B. NORTON , and C. M. BEBBER.T.
THE ELEMENTARY THEORY OF THE FLOW OF AIR THROUGH WIND TUNNELS.

If the air flowing through a wind tunnel and back through the room from the exit to the
entrance of the tunnel followed Bernouilli's theorem with exactness, there would be no change
in the energy possessed by a given particle of air, except for the loss due to friction, as the
kinetic energy lost on issuing from the tunnel would be restored in the form of pressure energy.
The power required to maintain the flow would then be

P =mx hf
where hf is the head (in fe et of air) 10 t b friction and m is the ma s of air flowing per second .
As the same mas of air must pas every point in the tunnel, the product of mean air speed by
cross-section area must be a con tant for its whole length, neglecting compressibility and changes
in temperature during the pa age.
inre the major part of the frictional los e occur in the
reduced section of the tunnel (provided that it i not very short and that the diffuser is not so
constructed as excessively to hamper the travel of the ail' from the tunnel back into the room)
hf would be practically independent of the ize and angle of the exit cone, and the power consumed would also be independent of these factors.
As a matter of fact the conditions of flow are not simple enough to permit the direct application of Bernouilli's theorem. Borda has shown that the loss of energy when fluid moving at
high velocity in a pipe is discharged abruptly into a large room or reservoir is equal to the
kinetic energy initially po essed. The kinetic energy is not converted into pressure energy as
the theory indicates that it should be, and it is therefore profitable to use an exit cone of considerable length, in order that pait of the kinetic energy may be saved by conversion into the
potential form before the sudden diseharge into the room. The length to which it is desirable
to prolong the cone is limited by the growing loss by friction within the exit cone itseli. A
more rapid conversion of the kinetic energy by increa ing the vertex angle of the exit cone is
forbidden by the unwillingness of the air to change its course suddenly and follmv the walls of
the exit cone. If the vertex angle be made too large the effect is almost the same as that of
an abrupt increase in cross section. Eiflel, a the result of an elaborate theoretical and experimental research on tunnels having exit cone generated by straight lines, has come to the conclusion that the vertex angle of the exit cone should be not more than 7°, and that the diameter
at the large end of the exit cone should be three time that at the small end. It is necessary to
base the dimensions of a tunnel on a compromise, as the arrangement which would give the
absolute maximum of efficiency would have to be housed in a building of prohibitive size. The
over all length can be materially reduced at the cost of a slight increa e in power, and the first
cost of the building, depending on its dimensions, must be balanced against the cost of operation, which varies with the power of the motor and so with the efficiency of the tunnel. The
relations to be observed among the variou dimensions of the tunnel and the angles of the cones
will be discussed more fully elsewhere. Knowing the power consumed by a tunnel, its diameter, and the speed of the air, the total 10 ses can easily be computed for that particular speed,

and the magnitude of the figure thus obtained will serve as a measure of the efficiency of operation of the tunnel. Since, however, the losses vary with the speed, they can not be compared
directly for two tunnels unless they are run at the same spood. The factor most commonly
used for comparisons between tunnels is the ratio of the kinetic energy posse sed by the air
passing through the tunnel in unit time to tho work done by the motor in unit time. 'Tills is
sometimes called the" over-all efficiency," but it is herein alludod to as the" energy ratio."
The term effi iency in this connection is misleading, as the two quantities inLroduced into the
ratio are not directly connected, but merely happen to have the same dimensions and so to be
convenient for the purpose. Furthermore, the value of the ratio is very commonly more than
1, and is sometimes very much more.
To determine the manner in which the power consumed varies with speed, and so determine the validity or otherwise of the above relation, as well as to find the relation which must
be preserved among the various factors in order that geometricR.lly similar tunnels may be
strictly comparable, the Theory of Dimensions may b used. The method pursuecl need not be
gone into in detail, as it has been described many times before, and it will suffice to summarize
the results. It appears that, if the compressibility of the air and the action of gravity on it be
. assumed to be of negligible importanee at the speeds employed, the power consumed is proportional, for geometrically similar tunnels, to the ero a-section area and to the cube of the speed,
provided that VD where V is the air speed, D the tunnel diameter, and
II

II

the coefficient of

kinematic viscosity, is maintained constant. Experiments conducted with a model tunnel at
Langley Field and fully described elsewhere in this report, as well as those carried on by Durand,
Castellazzi, and others, show that the" energy ratio" 'Varies but little with changes of VD and
J/

it is therefore safe to apply the results of model experiments to full-sized tunnels, even though
the speeds may not be strictly in inverse ratio to the diameters. In general, the " energy ratio"
increases as VD increases, and it therefore requires less power to drive a tunnel than would be
II

predicted from a direct application of the results of tests on a model of the tunnel and propeller.
The useful work done by a propeller is equal to the product of the thrust by the speed of
flow of the fluid through the propeller disk. The thrust of a wind tunnel propeller is then

where V'is the speed of the air past the propeller, and this equation holds good whether Bernouilli's theorem is followed or not, so long as hi is the total los of head from all cau es.

the weight of a column of air having a height equal to the total loss of head and a cros -secince the power i proportional to the cube
tional area equal to the disc area of the propeller.
of the speed, the thTU t varies as its square.
If the factors causing departures from Bernouilli's theorem are neglected, the useful work
done in moving the air against friction will be, as alre dy mentionod, independent of the degree
of expansion of area in the exit cone, and so of the diameter of the propellor. Under these conditions, in fact, the advantage in respect of power consumed would rest with tho short exit cone
and small propeller, as the propeller efficiency i highest for a large value of the "slip function "
and this is obtained by making the speed of the ail' through tho propeller high and keeping
down the diameter of the propeller. Assuming that the output of 'work is the same in all cases,
the thrust will be inversely proportional to the speed of air through the propeller, or directly
proportional to the disk area.

It i oby"iou from a tudyof the Drzewiecki theory of propeller action that a series of propellers of similar blade form and width-diameter ratio, all working at the same true angle of
attack, will give thrusts approximately proportional to N2D4, where N i the engine speed in
revolutions per unit time and D the propeller diameter. Thi proportion can be demonstrated
by the Theory of Dimensions to hold exactly true for geometrically similar propellers of perfect
rigidity, but it is very nearly correct even where propellers of different pitches are concerned.
It has been shown that the thrust of a series of propellers de igned to <h.-ive the same wind
tunnel or geometrically similar tunnels, is proportional to N2D4, and also to the cross-section
area, which, in turn, varie as D2. It follows from these two relations that N2D2 must be a
constant, and the peripheral speed of the propeller required to <h.-aw air through a wind tunnel
at any particular speed will therefore be quite independent of the diameter of the propeller if
the power required i independent of that diameter. It follows as an obvious corollary that, if
the power required i not independent of the degree of expan ion in the exit cone, the peripheral speed of the propeller will be lea t under the same conditions as those for which the
power required has its minimum value .
It i easily demonstrable that the stre ses, both those due to centrifugal force and tho e due
to bending by the air pres ure, in a eric of geometrically similar propellers depend only on
the peripheral peed, and that they vary a the square of that quantity. There is therefore a
limiting peripheral peed which can not be exceeded with safety. For wooden propeller, it is
unsafe to Tun the peripheral peed much beyond 60,000 feet per minute, or 305 meters per second,
and it is better to tay well inside this figurr. In the ca 13 of an airplane or airship where large
power mu t be taken on a single propeller the peripheral speed can be reduced by gearing down,
as the engine speed decrea e more rapidly than the propeller diameter increases. In the wind
tUlmel, it has just been hown that t-kis is not the ca e, and that the peripheral peed, and so
the stress, actually increa e if the propeller diameter 1's enlarged beyond a certain point. There
is then a learly defined upper limit to the power which it is afe to apply to m'iving the propeller in any given wind tunnel, and therefore a limit to the maximum speed attainable. This
maximum can only be raised by reducing the losses and so improving the over-all efficiency
of the plant.
Since the power required to secure a given speed with a given" energy ratio" is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, and is also proportional to VN2D4, the propellers
in a series of tunnels of dillerent diameters operating at the same speed and having the same
"energy ratio," all work at the same value of N2D2, and so of the peripheral speed. This leads
to the rather astonishing coneIu ion that the peripheral speed necessary to produce a given
air speed depends only on that air speed and on the energy ratio, and is not at all affected by the
size of the tunnel or of the propeller (except indirectly, in so far as these factors have an effect on
the energy ratio). For any value of the energy ratio, then, there is a limiting air speed which
can not be exceeded without running the peripheral speed up beyond the limits of safety, and
this speed is the same for large tunnels as for small, although the actual power con umed of
course varies w"ith the tunnel diameter. In order to realize the highest possible wind speed the
power coeiIicient of the propeller must be made as large as possible. - This can be done by using
many blades and by making them of high-lift ections set at relatively large angles of attack.
If the velocities desired are too high to be obtained in this way, it will be necessary to use two
or more propellers arranged in tandem, acting like a multi-stage compressor.
It has been shown that

and this value was obtained in a tunnel of very efficient type in combination with a propeller
having a total blade width equal to one-third of its circumference. Analysis by the Drzewiecki

metho~ leads to the belief that it will be possible to raise

or 607 miles an hour. This is a considerably higher speed than has yet been attained, or than
is ever likely to be desired in connection with the study of aircraft. If higher speeds should
be needed they can be secured either by the use of a multiplicity of propellers in series or, up
to a certain point, by the use of a fan with an abnormally large hub and short blades entirely
filling the periphery of the hub, as in the McCook Field tunnel,' where the hub diameter is

If

JD is raised to 5, a value only a little higher than that
2

in the McCook Field tunnel, the limiting airspeed for tho peripheral peed given above is
increased to 453 meters per second, or 1,012 miles an hour.l
The assumption has 0 far been made that the ail' has a free passage across the whole area
swept by the propeller. Of course the hub always blocks off a part of thi area, but it has
usually been an insignificant fraction. If the propeller diameter is n times the hub diameter, the
proportion of the area blocked off is \, and the speed of the ail' acro
n

the propeller blades,

assuming a uniform distribution everywhere out ide the hub, is increased in the ratio 1- 1.
n2
If the propeller be made, as is the coronion practice, with a constant blade width, and if the
lift coefficient be assumed constant all along the blade, the portion of the total thrust given by
the part of the blade inside of any given point is very nearly proportional to the cube of the
radius at that point. For example, one-eighth of the thrust would be given by the inner half
of the blades if they extended clear to the center, with no hub at all. The use of a hub, or
the covering up of part of the blades with a "spinner" therefore decreases the thrust in the
ratio 1- \. Since useful power is equal to the product of the thrust by the speed across

The increase in power coefficient by the use of a spinner, the propeller pitch being adjusted
to give the same angle of attack of the blades with as without the spinner, is 5 per cent for
a spinner or hub one-quarter the (liam ter of the propeller, 17 per cent when the ratio is onehalf, and 27 per cent when, as in the McCook Field tunnel, it is two-thirds. Furthermore, the
use of a very large hub makes it possible to u e more blades and make their total width a larger
fraction of the circumference of the circle swept by the blade. In the McCook Field fan there
are 24 blades, and their total width is approximately equal to the circumference of the hub.
Where very high speeds are desired, a in the calibration of air-speed meters, a throttling
insert has sometime been used to reduce the ection of a large tunnel. The effect is to increase
the speed, but usually much Ie s than is expected. If the " energy ratio" remained constant,
halving the diameter of the tunnel would increase the speed available with a given expenditure
of power by 59 per cent. A change of thi ort usually, however, dimini hes the energy ratio
unless the tunnel is of the type combining a long straight portion with conical ends, and permitting of the extension of the cones back into the straight eylinch'ical part. The use of a throttling insert in a tunnel with a short experimental chamber, like those u ed by Eiffel and Crocco,
is almost certain to lead to a large drop in energy ratio, and the increa e of speed by halving the
diameter in such a laboratory would probably be less that 50 per cent. Furthermore, it is
necessary for best results tha t the propeller ordinarily used be replaced by one especially designed
for use in conjunction with the throttling insert. If the diameter of the tunnel be halved the
area at the smallest section is divided by four, and, even with an increa e of 59 per cent in speed
at the throat or in the experimental chamber, the speed of the air pa t the propeller is reduced
by 60 per cent. Since the propeller diameter and its normal rotational speed to develop the
rated power are unchanged, the propeller for u e with the throttling insert mu t have a much
smaller effective pitch than that employed with the full section, if the maximum of efficiency is
to be obtained.
1 In this analysis the ehan;:e of density of the air, due to decrease of staLie pre sure with inereasing speed, is neglected. This does not lead
to a very hrge error, a both the propeller thrust and the frictional resistance to the passage of the ail' increase with the air density, the former
varying more rapidly than the latter.

RELATn1E ADVANTAGE OF SMALL AND LARGE TUNNELS.

It has just been shown that the gain in speed by reducing the diameter hy the use of fl,
throttling in crt is di appointingly small. This leads naturally to a study of the best ize of
wind tunnel to be employed, and of the relation between speed and size whi ch should be sought.
In the construction of aerodynamicallaboratori s, as the attempt has been made to approach
ever more nearly to full-flight conditions, two divergent schools of practice have grown up. The
first, best repre ented by the National Phy ical L.aboratory in England , has constantly increased
the diameter of the wind stream, and so increased the size of model which may be tested, but has
remained content with l' latively moderate wind speeds. The second, on the other hand, has
concentrated it efforts on the pumping of the air across a small ection at enormous velocity.
In comparing the merits of the high peed and the large diameter tunnels, there are three
points which must be borne in mind. In the flrst place, the highest pos ible value of LV (L V
being the criterion of dynamic similarity) is to be obtained with a minimum expenditure of
power.
econdly, the interference between the model and its support is to be re luced to a
minimum, and, finally, that disposition hould be favored which enn.bles us to secure the greatest
accurncy in the construction of the models.
I t has been shown that
P = J(A 113 = KtDZ V3
where D is the diameter of the tunnel and J{I is a constant.
In order to avoid interference between the model and the walls of the tunnel, the ratio of
maximum span to tUlUiel diameter mu t not exceed a certain value (u ually about 0.4) . etting
L, the span of the model, proportional to D, we can then modify the above equation:

The power required to drive the fan will therefore be least, for any given value of L V, in that
tunnel where the diameter is larg t and the .sp ed is smallest.
The relative magnitUde of the interference between the model and its support, the o-called
"spindle effect" depends on the ra tio of the spindle diameter to the linear dimensions of the
model. Its reduction is a l11,c'l.tter of very vital importance, the spindle correction undoubtedly
being the largest single source of error in most wind-tunnel te ts.
The bending moment in the spindle at any point (say one chord length from the wing tip)
is proportional to the product of the sp~n by the force acting on the model.

M = OtLF= OzL(D V2) = 02D V2.
If d is the diameter of the spindle, the relations between bending moment, fiber stress, and
deflection may be written :

as a larger spindle deflection i permis iblc with it larg<' tunnel than wi th a small one. In fact,
the permi ible deflection increase nearly a rapidly as doe the tunnel diameter.
In respect of the third considera tion, accuracy of construction of the model, the superiori ty
of the large tunnel, permitting the usc of a large model, is so manifest as hardly to call fo1' discussion. A model of 3-foot span can includ many part, such as fitting~ and wires, which it is
quite hopelc s to put on one of half that size.
So far , the advantage has rested with the large diameter in ev l'y particular. It has one
disadvantaae in that the ize and weight of the balance are much increased, longer weighing
arms, heavier counterweights, and a general Lrengthening up of the apparatu arc necessitated.
Furthermore, the initial co t of the building to hOll e a large tunnel is Yery hiah. In the writer's
opinion, h owevor , the advantage far outweigh tho drawbacl ,anel any future development of
wind tunnel for model testing hould proceed along the line of increa ing the diameter rather
than the speed.
All that has been said against high speed applie, of course only to tunnels for the testing
of models. Speed equal to the peeds of fliaht of airplane are essential for the calibration of
instruments.
DESIGN OF WIND TUNNEL PROPELLERS BY THE DRZEWIECKI THEORY.

It is pos ible, if the ra te of flow of the air through a wind-tunnel propeller be known, to predict
the performance of the propeller by the Drzewiecki theory. In 1 ed, the application of that theory
to wind-tunnel propeller i rather impler than it application to the airplane, a there is no
in-dr-aught correction to contend with. If the velocity at the minimum ection of the tunnel i
given, the velocity through the propeller ca n b compu ted with ab ' olu te ac uracy on the a sumption that the distribution aeros the exit cone is uniform. Thi a umption can only ju tify
itself in the re ult of the analysi derived from it a a ba i .
The be t way of checking th e aceuracy of the analytical method of de ign is to apply it
to a propeller already working sati factorily. Thi has been done with thepropelleru ed in the
model wind-tunnel experiments described in a later section of the report. Th angle of the rela tive wind to the plane of the propeller can be compu ted from the wind peed, and it i then po sible, knowing the angle of blade setting, to work back and find the angle of a ttack of each
blade element. Having this, the power consumed by the propeller and its efficiency can be
found in the u ual way. Thi wa done for two ell, e . I n the fir t ca 0 the tunnel was of the
Eiffel type, with an enlarged experimental chamber, and the calculated power checked the
aetual con umption within the experimental error (about 2 per cent, owing to uncertainty as to
motor los es). In the second ca e the air tream wa inclosed throughout, a cylindrical tube
being carri ed aero s the experimental chamber, and the pow I' con umed wa about 15 pel' cent
more than tha t calculated. It is con idered that both of these test howed a very fair check
and that the u e of the Drzewiecki theory for de ign i amply justified. The average errol',
both in the e and in other cases which have been tried, is in the direction of underestimation of
the power consumption.

ANNUAL REP ORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

In designing a propeller for a new tunnel it i necessary to make an e timate of the energy
ratio, and 0 of the peed for a given power. If the e timate is too low, the propeller pitch will
be made too low, and the propeller will work at an inefficiently small angle of attack. The
speed will be higher than that stirnated, but still no t so' high as it would be with a proper
propeller . If the propeller blade are m ade too narrow, or if too few blades are used, the full
power of the motor will not be ab orbed a t the rat d revolutions per minute. The speed will
then fail to r each the valu e expected fOT the rotational sp eed realized, the ano-Ie of the relative
wind t o the plane of the propell er will fall below the estimated value, and the angle of attack
of the blade elements will become inefficiently large. Any change of this sort from the designed
condition of operation tends to correct itself, a the larger angle of attack increases the power
con um ed and the thru t given by the propeller. This in turn speeds up the air and brings the
angle of attack to a lower value. It is for this reason that fairly atisfactory results h ave so

per min ute are known, a number of propellers have been computed for a variety of conditions
and the results expressed by a formula and a urve. The power i given by the formula

theoretical basis for the derivation of this formula is the ame as that for a formula derived

The efficiency of wind-tunnel propeller i u ually very low, and the maximum attainable
depends largely on the magnitude of the pitch ratio. In the propeller designed for the Langley

have been plotted against

this type has at least the advantage of being ea y to generate and to fabricate from wood or

other hand, have always used cones of curving form . It seems fair to a sume that the loss in
diverging nozzle is partially dependent on the deceleration of the fluid, and that the loss will
usually be least where the deceleration i least. It is obvious, furthermore, that the flow through
the exit cone will be smoothest and least turbulent when the form of the cone is smooth, and
that any abrupt change of slope of the wall, such a that at the juncture of the parallel portion
of the tunnel with an exit cone generated by a traight line, is liable to cau e the lines of flow
to break away from the contour of the tunnel wall, and to establish a region of " dead-water"

and turbulence around the per iphery of the xit cone. The smoothness of a curve can best
be judged by taking cLifierences or, if the equation of the curve is known, by plotting the der'ivatives. This wa done in de igning the cones for the Leland Stanford, Jr. , tunnel. I The plotting
of the curve of a celeration for a tunnel will then serve the double purpose of indicating the
smoothness of the curve and of giving the maximum rate at which the velocity of the air is
changing, and so the maximum for ce necessary for accelerating the moving stream.
A curve of velocity again t distance along the axis of the tunnel can be drawn on the
assumption that velocity is inver ely proportional to the square of the diameter of the tunnel.
This, of CO Ul' e, is true only for velocity parallel to the axis, and entirely neglects the radial
component. In order to obtain the acceleration from this curve, the derivative giving acceleration i written
dv dv dx
dv
dt = dx X dt = v X dx

The acceleration at any poin t along the tunnel is therefore equal to the product of the
ordinate of the curve just describ ed by its slope at that point. These factors can be found
graphically or, in the case of a curve for which the equation is lmown, analytically.
In the case of a straigh t cone, for example, the formula for diameter at any point is

where DI and D2 are the diameters at the small and large end of the cone, respectively, Z the
length of the cone, and x the distance from the small end. Then

velocity and then straightens it out again, only to force it to turn outward once more a few

THE THEORY OF LOSSES IN THE EXIT CONE.

The los es in the exit cone of a wind tunnel arise from three OUI'ces. The first is the friction against the walls, and is best determined by Fritzsche's formula for fluid friction. The
second is the divero-ing angle of the cone, which. as already noted, always leads to a loss of
energy as compared with the ideal conditions expressed by Bernouilli's theorem. The magnitude of this los is determined with satisfactory accmacy by .a formula densed by Fliegner.
Finally, there is a loss due to the udden release of the air from the exit cone and its pa sage into
the room, where its velocity drops almost to zero. This loss was shown by Borda to be equal
to the kinetic energy po ses ed by the air at the large end of the cone. These losse , and their
relation to the factor entering into wind tunnel design, too-ether with all the losses in other rafts
of the tunnel, haye been fully di cu ed by Eifl'el,1 and it is not nece sary to repeat hi work here.
For the ben fit of those de igning tunnels, however, a set of cmves has been plotted which
make it possible to read off at once the los in a straight conical exit cone of any type and to
determine given the limiting condition, such as size of building to house the tunn 1, the charince from 0 per cent to 90 per cent
acteristics of the best exit con for that particular ca e.
of the total 10 e in a tunnel (not including tho e in the propeller) occur in the exit cone the
problem of designing a tunnel with a high energy ratio i e entially a problem of reducing the
los es in the exit cone.
In figme 6 the ordinate are the vertex ano-Ie of exit cone, the abscissae the ratio of the
cross-section area at the large end of the cone to the cros -section area where models are tested,
at the throat or in the experimental chamber. The family of CUl'ves drawn in full lines are
cmves of equal loss, and the number which each one bear expre es the loss in the exit CODe as
a percentage of the kinetic energy po se sed by the air at the mallest ection of the tunnel.
For example, if there ,vere no los e except tho e in the exit CODe a tunnel having an exit cone
of form corresponding to any point on the cmve marked 20 would have an energy ratio of 5.
The nearly straight dotted lines running acro s the heet diao-onally corre pond to various
constant lengths of exit cone, and they are marked with the ratio of length to diameter at the
small end.
To illustrate the use of this chart in choosing an exit cone a few illustratiye examples will
be given.
1.
tunnel is to be 2 meters in diamet r. In order to keep the size and co t of the building
within reasonable limits, it is desired that the length of the exit cone shall not exceed 20 meters.
Subject to this limitation, the cone is to be chosen for maximum efficiency.
The r atio of length to diameter here i 10. Pas ing along the dotted line bearing that
number, it is een that it cuts the curve of 16 per cent 10 s at two point and that it does not cut
the 14 per cent CUl've at all, but that it approache neare t to the latter at the point (a = 6.8°,
n =4.) . It is usually be t to make n a little maller than the value for minimum 10 s in the
exit cone, a a r eduction in n is a reduction in the diameter at the large end of the cone and so
in the propeller diameter, and it has already been shown that this is favorable to propeller
efficiency. It would probably be be t, in this ca e, to take n= 4.3, a::: 6.1°, or some other
combination in that immediate neighborhood.
2 . A very l arge tunnel is to be built, and, in order that the propeller diameter may not be
unrea onably large, a well a to keep down the height of the building, the propeller diameter is
.
limited to twice the diameter of the tunnel at the minimum ection.
If the ratio of diameters at the ends of the exit cone i 2, n = 4. Drawing a vertical from
the scale of ab cissre at this point, it is een that it appro ache nearest to the 14 per cent CUl've
at (a=4.5°). The length of the exit cone for this angl i 13 time the minimum diameter. It
would not be advisable, under the e conditions, to choo e the cone for the absolute maximum
of efficiency, a the length could be decreased 4t di.ameters at a cost of only 5 per cent
increa e in the total power by increasing ex to 6.7°.

entrance cone, and at E, thl'ee-quarters of the w .' !Lcross the chamber, the velocity dropped off
in a mooth curve from very near the center IIf the stream out to far beyond its normal
boundarie .
The velocity distribution in the oxit cone was exceedingly strange. The velocity dropped off
rapidly from a maximum at the center, so that tIle stream appears actually to contract rather
than to expand in tho exit cone. As in the entl ance cone, there was another maximum near
the wall,' but it was farther from the wall than as that at the entrance, and the velocity was
much lower than at the center. Directly in frOT t of the propeller the velocity at the center
dropped sharply, due to the hub, and varied in ar irregular manner over the rest of the section.
The flow at this point was so turbulent and so v arying in direction that the measurements of
velocity may contain considerable errors.
In order to make direct observations on the saarpness of definition of the edge of the stream
in the experimental chamber and to determine t e general nature of the flow in the chamber
an observer got inside and sounded the flow with a thread. It was evident that the air in the
whole chamber wa much stirred up, and that the How near the nominal edge of the stream was
extremely turbulent, except in the immediate neighborhood of the entrance. Even in the farthe t corners of the chamber, at a distance from the center of the stream equal to more than
three times its nominal diameter, there was still a' distinct movement of the air. The motion
everywhere was very unsteady, the direction of flow at a given point changing 60° or more
almost instantaneously. The best defined part 0 ] t he circulation was near the small end of the
exit cone, where two strong vortices rotating in 0 Jposite direction existed in the corners of the
chamber. rfhe examination of the flow was not e ( t nded to point above and below the stream
in this neighborhood, 0 it is not certain whether ,n' not a complete vortex ring, urrounding the
opening into the exit cone, exi ted. The results of this examination of the flow in the oxperimental chamber made it clear that the balance w(luld have to be shielded in some way from tho
air currents if any accurate work was to be dOl e. In Eiffel's tunnel partial shielding of the
balance i accompli hed by placing it on a platfor n which, however, extend across only a small
proportion of the width of the room, and can hardl! act as a complete protection from air-currents
for the mea uring instruments.
The power curve is plotted in figure 14 (c )"ve No.1) and the curve of speed against
revolutions per minute in figure 15 (curve - ). 1). The energy ratio varied too little
and too irregularly to make it worth while to plot a curve.
Its mean value was 0.90,
making no allowance for propeller losses. If th e propeller efficiency be assumed to be 57 per
cent (the value calculated by the Drzewiecki m ( thod), the energy ratio for the tunnel proper
becomes 1.58.
In view of the inegul'arities of flow found in t he experimental chamber it was decided to try
next the e:n'ect of ineld ing the stream in a cylin<heal tube during its passage across the experimental chamber.
0 attempt wa made to make the tube air-tight, the sUltic pressure inside
the tube being equal to that in the experimental chamber, which was carefully made air-tight.
Curve o. 2 in figure 14, and aloin figure 15, co -respond to this case, and the traverses of the
stream at points corresponding with those taken jo r the original model are plotted in figure 16.
Comparing these traverse with those in figu '0 13 it is seen that the nature of the distribution in the entrance cone is practically unaffecL3d. The velocity at point 0 was a little less
regular than for the case of the unconstrained strna ,showing an increase near the walls similar
to that which characterized the entrance cone. At D and E, however, the velocity was much
more even with the inclosing tube than withou t it, being constant within 1 per cent over 75
per cent of the diameter. Evidently, from the 3t andpoint of steadines of flow, the inclosed
type of tunnel is superior to the Eiflel type.
In the exit cone the effect of surrounding the stream with a definite boundary was till more
apparent. At F the velocity three-quarters of the way from the center to the walls was 94 per
cent of that at the center, as against 67 pOl' cent III the original model. At G the corresponding
figures were 82 per cent and 40 per cent. At H ther e was, as in the first case, a minimum at the
center and two maxima, the distribution of velo'lit.y being reasonably uniform across the outer
70 per cent of the blade, which is the most effec ,i~'e portion.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

It is reasonable to suppose, in view of the bett'3rj;filling of the exit cone and of the generally
improved velocity distribution, that the energy ratio would b.e increased by inclosing the stream,
r
and this supposition lwas fully justified by the pOWE measurements. For a given r ate of rotation

of the propeller the wind speed was increased w11.ue the power consumption was decreased,
and the power consumption for a given wind spee :J. was decreased just about 50 per cent. The
energy ratio with the inclosing tube was 1.83 for th whole installation, or, making due allowance
for the propeller losses, 3.20 for the tunnel alone.

DESIGN OF WIND TUNNELS AND WIND TUNNEL PROPELLERS.

It is evident that the inclosure of the stream improves the results in every way. The results
obtained in these experiments, so far as power consumption is concerned, check very well with
those obtained in some similar experiments on model tunnels, calTied out by Lieut. Castellazzi. 1
Lieut. Castellazzi found that the efficiency was decreased 40 per cent by the use of an open
experimental chamber. The experimental chamber used in his experiments was round in cross
section and was twice as large in diameter as the entrance and exit cones where they entered the
chamber, and the slightly greater loss in efficiency found in the experiments conducted at
Langley Field may be accounted for by the larger size and more irregular form of the experimental
chamber there employed.
EFFECTS OF VARIATION IN EXIT CONE FORM.

The next series of experiments dealt with the effect of alterations in exit cone form. It
was originally the intention to make a number of cones of different forms, but this plan was
abandoned after two had been tried, and the experiments cover only the parabolic and straight
forms of cone. These are as widely different from each other in respect of their acceleration curves
as are any two forms which would be likely to be used.
The curves of power and revolutions per minute with the straight cone are plotted as
curve No.3 in figures 14 and 15. The mean energy ratio is 1.83 for the combination of tunnel and
propeller, or 3.20 for the tunnel alone, values identical with those for the parabolic cone. It
is evident from the curves that the effect of changing the exit cone from a parabolic to a straight
form was very slight. The parabolic form seems to have a slight advantage at high values of
VD and to be inferior at low values, but the difference between the two yurves is in no case in
excess of the possible experimental error. In view of these results it appears that the efficiency
of a tunnel is not affected appreciably by exit cone form or by the nature of the acceleration in
the cone, but only by its length, mean angle, and total expansion ratio.
The large acceleration suddenly imposed on the air at the juncture between the parallelsided portion of the tunnel and a straight exit cone might be expected to cause turbulence,
so that the flow would be less regular than with a parabolic or other smoothly curving form.
No experimental data are available on this point as yet, as the experiments were temporarily
halted by an accident to the propeller before traverses and investigations of the flow had been
calTied out with the straight cone.
OBSERVATIONS OF THE NATURE OF THE FLOW THROUGH THE PROPELLER.

The most noticeable feature of the flow behind the propeller is the great rapidity with
which the slip stream spreads. Instead of contracting, as in the case of an airplane propeller,
where the direction of inflow is unrestricted, the stream expands immediately on passing clear
of the cone, the air changing its direction so that there is a strong moveme.nt of the air, in a
direction approximately at right angles to the axis of the tunnel, at a distance of 30 cm. back
and 50 cm. out radially from the edge of the exit cone.
The flow in the throat and cones was very steady at all points except near the edges of the
stream. The velocity head varied with a total amplitude of oscillation of about 2 per cent of
the head and a period of from 20 to 40 seconds. On passing the propeller the pulsations of
velocity became much more marked. The period of the pulsations close behind the propeller
was about half a second, and the maximum velocity was estimated to be about 50 per cent
greater than the minimum, although no means of measuring and making a continuous record of
a rapidly varying velocity were available. On going farther away from the propeller along the
lines of flow of the air the pulsations steadily increased in violence and the p eriod lengthened
until, at a distance of about 80 cm. to the rear of the propeller, the flow consisted of a violent
gust about every second, the velocity in the intervals between these gusts being so low as to be
hardly perceptible. These observations on the nature of the flow and its variations held in a
general way for all the models tried, but the pulsations of velocity were much more marked for
the case where the experimental cham er was left open than for that where it was inclosed in
a tube.

EXPERIMENTS ON THE EFFECT OF DISKS AND SPINNERS ON THE P ROPELLER.

I n order to secure some idea of the effect of e Itrging the hub of a propeller or of attaching
a spinner, some experiments wer e made with d,isks o· wall board attached in front of and behind
the propeller, and also with a paper cone projecting from the propeller into the exit cone. The
results of these tests do not fairly repr esent what might be secured with a good spinner and a
propeller especially designed for it, as the propeller pitch should be increased when a spinner is
incorporated or the hub is enlarged, but they will giye some idea of the effect.
The effect of placing a disk in front of the centI'lLl portion of the propeller, the rear not being
covered and the blades not being housed in any way, was to decrease the wind speed and increase
the power consumption. The inner par ts of the blades acted as a centrifugal blower, taking air
in from the rear and throwing it out r adially. T he increase in power, with a disk half the
diameter of the pr opeller , was 9 per cent, the decr i,se of speed with the same disk 19 per cent.
With a disk only one-fifth the diameter of the prcpeller the speed was decreased 5 per cent.
These measurements were made at a speed of 10 m ot el'S per second and with the parabolic exit
cone. The relative loss by the addition of a disk w s greater with the straight cone and at high
speeds, the addition of a disk four-tenths.the diame1el' of the propeller causing an increase of 28
per cent in power and a decrease of 19 per cent in speed at a speed of 34 meters a second with the
straight exit cone. The energy ratio was decreas(ld 59 per cent. All subsequent tests were
made with the straight cone, and the losses would pI obably be less with other forms.
The addition of another disk of equal size behind the propeller, so preventing any flow in
from the rear and out toward the tips, improved the performance as compared with the single
disk in front of the propeller, bu t remained inferior to the original case with no shielding at all.
The power was increased only 6 per cent as comparllcl with the original case without any disks,
but the speed was decreased 16 per cent and the en Igy ratio fell off 44 per cent. When the rear
disk alone was in place, so that any air thrown rad ,all~ outward had to come from inside the
exit cone, the power was increased 6 per cent, the v\~locity decreased 5 per cent, and the energy
ratio decreased 19 per cent, using the model without disks as a standard in all cases. The disk
behind the propeller therefore gave better results t,han did complete sheathing, either in the
form of disks or faired by a cone in front.
The addition of a cone, having a diamet er equal /'o two-fifths the diameter of the exit cone
at its large end and an altitude of one and a quarter times its own diameter, in front of the propeller decreased the power about 2 per cent and incnased the speed 7 per cent as compared with
the values for the disks alone, bu t the energy ratio was still 30 per cent lower than for the original
case. I t seems strange at first that the entire blocki g off of a considerable portion of the blades
should increase the power consumption for a given number of revolutions per minute, but the
phenomenon can be accounted for by the higher ai speed past the propeller when the area of
the exit cone is constricted by enlarging the hub. ~~be theory of the effect of an enlarged hub
or spinner has been discussed in another section of 'jhis report.
It appears that the addition of a spinner or the enlargement of the hub caused serious loss
in every case wher e it was tried with the str aight CO'l e. The loss with a parabolic cone is much
less, and it is likely that, with a pr opeller properly designed to allow for the increased velocity
due to the blocking off of part of the ar ea of the exit cone by the spinner, results as good as those
in the original case could be obtained. I t may ever. b e that they could be materially improved
on, but this does not seem very prob able in view 0: the uniformly poor results shown in these
experiments, wher e the presence of the spinner can h ardly have decreased the propeller efficiency
more than 10 per cent (a loss which, as ah'eady notod, could be prevented by the adoption of a
pr opeller designed especially for the new condit ions ). The loss in propeller efficiency, therefore,
would not be sufficient entirely t o account for the decrease of energy ratio . The' principal value
of a very large hub is to incr ease the power coeffic .ent of the propeller and make possible the
reduction of the peripheral speed for a given wind speed.
