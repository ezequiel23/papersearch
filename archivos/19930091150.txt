The following remarks apply only to conditions in -which the cooling surfaces are reasonably
cIean:
1. Heat transfer from an ordinarily smooth surface may be increased 17 per cent. for a
giren air flom} by gi~ing the surface a high polish; or it may be decreased 10 per cent .or more by
smokimg the surface; but
2. Surfaces likely to be obtained in radiators, if fairly clean, -w-illnot differ in smoothness

:3. Heat transfer from a radiator maybe considerably decreased if the surfaces are not kept
reasonabIF clean.
-I. Heat transfer from a radi~tor (at a given airpkne speed) may be slightly increased if
special attention is given to smoothness of surface, on account of a small increase in air ffow
through the core.
5. Heat traosfer is practically unaffected by a light coating of clean oil on a smooth surface.
6. Pressure graclient is practically independent
of the rough=
of the surface o-rer a
considerable range.
7. Pressure gradient is practically unaffected by a light coatingg of clean oiI on a smooth
surface.
S. Head resistance of a radiator may be s~ightly decreased by polishing the surfaces (8 per
cent. obser~ed in one case).
9. FIOW of air through the core of a radiator may be somevhat hcreased by polishing the
surfaces (5 per cent obser~ed in one case).
10. Figgre of merit of a radiator may be somewhat increased by polishing the surfaces
(6 to 10 per cent obsem-ed in one case).
II. ln general, the performance of a radiator may be improved by polishing the surfaces;
but. if they are fairly smooth and clea ~, a comiderable polish is requiredto produce much change
in the properties of the radiator, and there is a question -whether or not such a method for
improvement be practicable.
Since the performance of an aircraft radiator depends upon its capacit~for transfer of heat
from cooling surfaces to mom
air, and upon resistance offered to the passage of the air stream}

any metal will conduct heat through the thin walls of the water tubes as rapidly as it can be
transferred from the surface of ihe tubes to the air. The composition and the thickness of
the metal are of some importance in the case of surface not backed by flowing water, but it
wilI not be considered here, as this report wilI cieaI only with the mechanical condition of the
surface.
lt wilI be shown that the degree of roughness or smoothness of the surface is capable of
causing important effects on rate of heat transfer and on head resist ante, but that in actuaI
radiatom having fairI~ clean surfaces, the clifferences between vw-ious degrees of smoothness
me not sufficient-to gme the effects on rzdiator properties that might be obtained if it were
practicable to have the surfaces highly polished.
If, ‘how-ever, the cooling surfaces become
coated with oil and dust, the decrease in rate of heat transfer may be \-cry great.
The experimental work on which this report is based consisted of the following measurements, which are described in detail below:
1. Heat transfer from a single tube, with different conditions of surface.
11. Heat transfer from t~vo radiators, each with rough and somewhat smoothed surfaces,
111. Pressure drop in a single tube with different conditions of sur[ace.
N. Pressure drop in two radiators of similar constructio~~, but one with rough, and the
.
other with somewhat smoothed, surfaces.
V. Head resistance of one radiator section, before anrl after the surfaces had been
somewhat smoothed.
VI. Mass flow of air through the core of one racliator section, before and after the
surfaces had been somewhat smoothed.

II. EFFECT OF SURFACE ON HEAT TRANSFER FROM A RADIATOR.

The usual test of heat transfer in terms of air flow was made on two radiator sections 4 and
5 inches (10.2 and 12.7 cm. ) deep, and with +-inch and +&inch (0.64 cm. and 0.S7 cm. ) circular
cells, respectively, each before a,ncl after the cooling surfaces had been somewhat smoothed.
The original surfaces were considerably rougher than those of many well-made radiators, and
the smoothed surfaces were somewhat-better
than those usually found in radiators, but did not
even approximate to the high poIish obtained in tke single tube mentioned above. The curves,
shown in Plot 3, indicate no difference in heat transfer greater than the limit of experimental
error, and it appears that although it is possible to increase the heat transfer considerably by
giving the surf~ces a high polish, it is nevertheless true that any surface likely to be obtained
in commercial production will not have a sufIlcientIy high polish to take drantage
of this fact.

It W-M SUpported by two pieces of piano wire, which were attached to the ends, stretched over crossbars
set in the tunneI 2 or 3 feet in front of and behind the racliatorj and carried outsicle of tho tunnel,
to facilitate moving the tube forward ancl backward.
One side of an i~clined water gage was
connected to the rear end of the exploring tube, and the other was connected to a piezometer
ring in front of the radiator.
It was found by trial that consistent results could be obtained
if only ordinary care -was used in centering the exploring tube inside of the air tube of the radiator.
Pressure drop between the piezometer ring and the exploring tube was expressed in pounds
per square foot; and the air flow, in pounds per second per square foot of fron tal area of radiator
core, Previous work in a wind tunneI under partial vacuum has shown thut the pressure drop
between piezometer rings before and behincl the radiator is inversely proportional
to the air
density at the front ring (for a given air ffOW), and this relation was used to correct for variations
in density during the time of the observations.
Curves for two rates of air flow are shown in Plot 4, and the following table shows the -values
of the pressure gradients inside the radiator tube, both in pounck per square foot per inchj and
in grams per square centimeter per centimeter, together with the per cent by which the gradient
in the “rough tube exceeds that in the smooth tube. The per cent of cfifference indicated is
somewhat too high, because the two radiators were not quite identical, the one with rough
tubes having a free area about 3 per cent less, and a heacl resist~nce about 7.5 per cent higher,
than the other had before its tubes were smoothed.
