BATEWN.

INTRODUCI’ION.

This paper was submitted to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics by
Professor EL Bateman, of the California Institute of Technology, and its publication duly
authorized by the committee as Technical Iteport No. 80.
The mathematical theory of the stability of a parachute which is sytumetrical with respectt
to a plane is very simiIar to the weILlmowmtheory of the stability of an airphme, but the values
of the resistance coefficients are naturally difl’erent. When the parachute does not rotate, it
may be compared with an airplane in a straight dive. There are osctiations corresponding to
the Longitudinal and lateral oscillations, and these are practically independent of one another.
Thus, when the parachute swings like a pendulum as it descends, we have an oscillation corresponding to the pitching of an airpIane, while there is another type of oscillation which correspends to the Dutch roll.
When the parachute is symmetrical about an axis, so that it has the form of a solid of revolution, there may be no banking in the oscillation corrwponding to the Dutch roll, and the
oscillation then becomes a simple swing like the one which corresponds to the pitching of an
airplane. In this case a combination of two simple swings in perpendicular phmes may give rise
to a compound oscillation, which maybe likened to the motion of a conical pendulum falling
under gravity. In the general case the combination of the simple swing and Dutch roll gives
rise to a compound motion of a complicated character.

DISCUSSION.

To discuss the matt~ amd~ticdy we shall write down the equations of motion in the
notation used by G. H. Bryan* and S. Brodetsky.2 We shall take the tis of y M“axis of symmetry and assume that in the steady state the parachute is faLlingwith veIocity V in a vertical
direction, which coincidw with the axis of y, and is rotating with angular velocity Q around the
axis of y. This Iast assumption is made for the sake of generality, so as to cover the case of a
rotating solid of revolution and to obtain a condition corresponding to some extent with the case
of the helicopter where the Longitudinal and lateral oscillations are not independent. The
equations of motion may be written in the form

It is on account of these ratations that the analysis for the symmetrical parachuts is
simpler than that for an airplane in a straight drive. If, in fact, we neglect squ&ws of small

the axis of z is to the left of the axis of z, the axis of y beingi~ownwards, this means that the
center of gravity moves on the cylinder in the counterclockwise direction.
The equation @+0 = XOe~”~@~
implies that at the same time the axis of symmetry pre
cesses around the vertical in the counterclockwise direction. If we disregard theverticd motion
the character of the oscillation may be pictured by imagining a cone representing the parachute to partly roll and partly slide on the outside of another cone whose axis is verticaL
Let us call this a potitive owi.llution sad use the term negative oscillation to denote one
in which P is negative and the two motions take place in the cloclrwiae direction.
Either a positive or negative oscillation can be regarded as built up from two simple
swings in perpendicular planes, the two swings having the same period and damping time,
but dtiering in phase by a quarter period. By combining two such swings with an arbitrary
difference in phase a type of elliptic oscillation is obhiued.
It should be noticed than au umdmnpedpositive oscillation may correspond to a n~ t~e
of steady motion of the parachute. If such a motion exist it is characterized by v= o, g= o
and the fact that the cubic equation has two purely imaginary roots.
Thus cubic equation may be written in the form

P+yv+zwx+z=o
where

Let k’ -M

+6 be a factor of the cubic, then a and 8 are determined by the equations

With the aid of these equations we can plot the curves t= cmstat

The effect on a negative oscillation is to increase both the period and the time of damping.
The effect on a simple subsidence is to make it periodic and increase the time of damping.
The effect of rotation when u and r are not both positive is easily inferred.
In order that u,, u,, u, may all be negative and the damping times for the three disturbances associated with & al+ i131, l – @, all increased, it is necessary, but not sufficient, that
a
Q@, QI, and Qj2should all be positive. Now N.= JO+Qj2, hence it is necessary in the first
place that the effect of the rotation should be to increase N.. The effect on the period is of
some interest because in generaI the single period and time of damping associated with the
two conjugate roots cq+i#i and ~ –if?,, will give rise to two different periods and two different
times of damping; also a new positive or negative oscillation with a long period will arise from
the simple subsidence associated with the root 1.. The phenomenon of the division of one
period into two @ somewhat analogous ta that which occurs in the Zeeman effect, especially
as we may have a compound oedlation buiIt up from positive and negative circular osciUatione of nearly equal period. The curves in Figure II give the horizontal projection of the
Ca= of compath of the center of gravity of the parachute or helicopter ti two Pathh
pound oscillations of tie abo~e type. ‘ti the
first case the two component circular oscillations are undamped, in the second case they
are both damped, the rata of subsidence being
the same in each case. A complete discussion of the effect of rotation on stability is
out of the question at present owing to our
lack of knowledge of the values of the various
resistance coefficients, but it may be worth
while to ascertain the conditiom for stability
by iimling the conditions that a cubic equation with complex coefficients may have roots

The ~ethod given by E. J. Routh’ for finding the conditions that an algebraic equation
