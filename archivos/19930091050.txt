A radiatir when mounkd on any particular airplane will have a

air and
plane, the location of raz “stir, the temperatures of L
water, the barometric pressure, and the rate of circulation of the
cooling water. The figure of merit as used herein is defied es the
ratio of the power (i. e., in the form of heat) abstracted from the

GASLEAKAGE.
The vohme of air hiking thro h the body of the phqg has been
measured for a number of types Y pl
o
This was done by screwing the plug into a. container and app fi~ an sir presmre of 150
T
The entire container was then immersed
‘Om& r of ‘Tme ‘*” to 200° C. This heating develops any leaks
m a tan
01 heated
which result from differential thermal expansion and is very severe
since the outer parts become heated fit.
A graduated 1sss tube,
originally filled with oil, can be placed over the lug and & e volume
of air escaping thus cdected and measured. b e amount of this
varies from zero up to several cubic centimeters per second, but a
good plug should not show more than 0.2 c. c. per second.
SPECIFICATIONS.

@ collaboration. wit+ the inspection division of the Si
COW,
they matemal speedication No. 28004 was drawn up and 1snow being
remsed in several details. A copy of this specification is appended to
this report. Some 25 difF~~tm~~
of lug have been teatcd in
~e~$ance
with these
,“
. T~e principal tcsta ao far
at high temperatures,
are. those for 3 ectrical r~tance
gas le &
e, chelectric strength and cracking under sudden changea
m temperature.
The first two teste are based on the work described above the
limits set at present being that the titauce
of the IU shah be
greater than 500,000 ohms at 400° C. and that the gas YE age shalI
ca
not exceed 0.2 c. c. per second of free ah at 200° C. and 150 pounds
per sqpare in+.
The coId chdectric strength is measured by placing the insulators under oil end applying an alternating electromotive force,
betwem the center dectrode and a narrow metal strip around tho
center of the insulator. Good material should withstand 25 to 30
kilovolte, at which voltage flash over through the oil occurs.
The ody test avaihb]e for cracking consists in heating the porcdain insulators to 300° C. and then @m@ng them into water at–
room temperature. They me then sub ected to an electical breakdowq teet to detect spy serious ~a ~.
It hm been found that
soaking the porcelains m an alcohohc solution of eosin is a very sen@JJ;b~t
and will show cracks which would otherwise be entirely
. The quenching ted at 300° foIlowed by u application of
volt+ge has been the sub ect of considerable adverse criticism and is
adnuttedl very drastic; ‘but since materials am available which will
withstan c? it, it seems best to retain it until a betta test is devised.
