HORIZONTAL BUOYANCY II?WIND TUNNELS.

The following report on ‘!orizontal Buoyancy in Wind Tunnelsm was
H
submitted to the National Advis@ry Comzittee for Aeronautics by Dr, A.
F. Zahm, Member, Ccamittee on Aerodynamics.
Distinction of relative flow. - F&cm the earnest etudy of hydromeohanics it has been assmed that the reaction between a stagn~t
fluid and a body moving through it is the seineas for the fluid passing the fixed body with the same relative motiom
So many experiments
however seemed to disprove the assumption that at one time scme prcminent investigators questioned its validity. For exanple, Dubuat and
~OhO’min found experimentally mat a ‘platifixed in a str~
of water
has about thirty per cant more resist~ce than when moving through still
water at the sane speed. This Phenomenon was called Wubuatts Paradoxn.
But when dw pr~aution is tw~
to m~e the relative motion the seine
in both cases, as was dons with an apparatus developed by JGUkOVSki
and Kouznetzoff, the assumption is completely vindicated. The reader
may find a description of this apparatus in Jotikovski~s
Aerodymaique,
Chapter 11.
But suoh equivalence of relative motion can not alwaYs be realized.
When for example,. body moves through an extended hmogeueous still
a
fluid the relative velocity of all distant parts of the fluid is uniform,
and the undisturbed horizontal pressure gradient is zero; but when the
fluid moves past the body usually all the distant parts have not the
same velocity, usually ther,e
is srxneturbulence, and the pressme gradient is not zero. And if the gradient is not zero there is a horizontal buoyancy to be applied as a correction to make the observed resistance equal that for the still fluid.
Stat%c pressure ~adient. - Inuntagering wind tunnels, for instance,
th8re is amaterial fa31 of static pressure down stream withiu the walled
working portion. If the tunnel is well designed and unobstructed, th=
down-strean pressure gradient is cons-t
for any one wind speed, and
varies naarly as the sqyare of thb wind VelocZty. If the tunnel is ~tly obstructed with apparatus, the gradient may, at aq fixed speed, very
in amount from point to point along stream.

for ZMbtWd fluids is a chief element of re~ist~ce, especially for
bodies of blunt form. Its discussion is irrelevant to the present
treatment. The tiag due to 22 may here be formulated for various conditions.
Camutation of horizontal buoyancy. - The ccmponent of horizontal
buoyanoy at any element of the model’s surface is 1 P2d ~, in ~hi~ 1
is the direction cosine, referred to the tunnel axis, of the normal to
the surface elemeat d S. To find the surfsoe integral of this ccmpcnent analytically one must know the equation to S; also to the ~essure
dropp2, in terms of the distance along stre=. Themeth~
of integrating is too familiar to require treatment here.

For example, 9 may be a surface of revolution, suoh as a balloon hull;
or a cylinder, such.as a uniform stream-line strut. The static pres~e

against the do~ SWeUI dis~c~ fr~ them~~~s

The pressure-drop drag on a cylinder held transverse to the stream,
and having a plane of symmetry parallel thereto, is, per unit length,
R=2/p2.

BEethodsof ccmputation in Qraotioal use. - Formula (3) has been
used in the reports frcm the Aero@nsmioal Laboratory., %shington
Navy Yard, sinoe July, 1919, when it was first shown by accurate
measurement that the pressure gradient i6 constant along the working
PO@tion of the 8S x 8~ tunnel freed of obstructions. In scum of the
earlierreports gra~ic~
integration had been employed because rneasxmements, too hwried ~
ins-i ~ently &ecked, had indicated a
slightly variable pressure gradient. This mistake in measuring the
gradient entailed an error of the order of one or two per Oent in
finding the total drag on the models tested.
A detailed aoeount of the calibration of the 81 x 8t tunnel, for
pressure gr~~en~, LS given in tti laboratorys Report No.148.
For streamline bodies of c~siderable bthe pressure-drop eorrection is a good percentage of the whole resistance. Xf, therefore,
the tunnel must have a mat~ia
press~e ~tii~t,
it is fortunate
when this is so nearly constant that formula (3) can be used to canpute the pressure-L-op
ccrredion.
The value of
a need be determined but once for a given tunnel, and the value of v for a model
of eny shape can easily be found by imnersion in wa~er.
