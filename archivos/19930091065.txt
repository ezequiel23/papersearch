REPORT No. 35.
THE STRENGTH OF ONE·PIECE SOLlO, BUILT-UP AND LAM! 'ATED WOOD AIRPLANE
WING BEAMS.
By

JOHN

H.

NELSON.

The present war ha caused an Ullprecedented demand lor selected spruce for airplane
construction. The increased demand has nece'sarily caused a greatly increased output.
However, the magnitude of the requirements and methods of con truction, whereby a large
part of the selected stock is wasted in the construction of the one-piece beams, makes the
problem of furnishing ufficient selected stock a very serious one, even with the enlarged output.
The remedy for this condition lies either in the discovery of a perfectly satisfactory substitute for th spruce now used, 01' in the development of some method of construction which
will conserve the pre ent upply by utilizing more of t.he selected material.
In an attempt to find a solution of the above problem, certain experiments were conducted
during the po. t. year at the Bureau of ,tnn dnnls. Tests were macle on several of the more
common woods to d<>termil1e t.llC'ir suiUtbi lity a. . ub t.itute for spruce. Further, beams built
up of three pieces or of laminnted co nstruction have been te ted to cletermine their strength
in compari on with the one-piece construction .
Th<> built-up and laminated con. tructions t'liminate th wa te involved in the pl"Oce s of
cutting an I sect.ion from . olid timber. In uch construction it is also possible to use wood
in short lengths, and t.hough the cost of manufacturing built-up beams is somewhat greater
than that of producing the solid beam, the co t of the raw material utilized is much less than
the cost of the carefully selected timbers used for solid beams.
The purpose of this report i to summarize the results of all wood airplane wing beams
Lested to date in the Bmeau of Landards laboratory in order that the various kinds of wood
and methods of construction may be compared.
All beams tested were of an I section and the majority were somewhat similar in size and
cross sect.ion to the front wing beam of the Cmtiss IN-4 machine.
As to methods of constluction, the beams may be classed as (1) solid beams cut from solid
stock; (2) three-piece beam, built up of three pieces, web and flanges glued together hy a
tongue-and-groove joint; and (3) laminated beams built up of thin lamin ations of wood glued
together.
This report include three set of te t data:
(a) Fourteen solid beam, de ignated by English numerals in th is report, wer e made in
the Bureau of Standards hop. The pmpose of these te ts wa (1) to determine the uitability
of fir and cypress woods for airplane usc, compared with itka spruce, and (2) to determine
whether a plain rectangular I -section beam po ses ed any advantage over the oblique I-section
beam, which is used at pre ent, other than the advantage of simplicity in hop practice.
(b) Fifteen beams were ubmitted for test by the aval Aircraft Factory, Philadelphia.
These beams were designated by the Roman No. I, to identify the series, followed by subnumbers 5 to 19, to indicate the beam of the erie. The e beam were all built of spruce;
seven were solid beams and eight were three-piece beam . These tests were made (1) to determine the advantage of the rectangular I -section o\-e1' the oblique I-section, if any; (2) to compare
three-piece beams with solid ?eams; and (3) to determine the effect of splicing three-piece beams.

(c) Twenty-three laminated beams were submitted for test, 14 by the West Woodworking
Co. of Chicago, and 9 by Aeronautical Equipment (Inc.), of N ew York Cit:v. These beams
are designated by Roman numerals throughout this report. Four of the e beams were built
of cypre s wood and the remainder of spruc('; It number of the spruce beams had additional
lamination ' of hardwood placeu adyantageou~ly ill the beam section . These beams were tested
to determine the merits of laminated beam construction, with the view of u ing it as a substitute
for solid beam.
All beams were 90 inches long. A sketch of each beam sec(.ion, giving its dimensions and
properties, is shown on the following pages. Photographs are also shown of sections cut from
laminated beams I to XX.
METHODS OF TEST .

All beams were tested for transverse strengtl hy two-point loading. Load wa applied
at points 24 inches from supports in an 84-inch span.
A vibratory or repeated stre test was made on beam J o. X to note the effect of vibrations
upon a laminated beam. The beam was loaded repeatedly to a tress of about two-thirds
the ela tic limit. Applications of stress OCCUlTed at the rate of 7-1 per minute for 14t hours.
It was then loaded to rupture and the results noted.
Shear tests of glued joints were made on sections cut from a number of the first laminated
beams, to determined i,he ability of the glue joints, b tween the web and 1lange , to withstand
hear tre se. To avoid unneces ary columns of figlU'C'S, the glue shear test data "ill be omitted
from this report. The re ult hawed the glue joillt to br stronger in shear than the wood
web srction in the ca e of relatively dry test specimens, and also in the casC' of moist specimens
expo, cd for four and one-hali days in a humidity ehambrl' (relative humid ity 65 per cent
aturatiol1, at 65° F) before being tested.
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.

While this report does not contain data from an exhau tive series of te ts on built-up
beam can tructions, it is apparent that the results obtained are conelu ive enough to warrant
the acceptance of certain definite conclusions. This is true notwith tancling the fact that
the work was carried out under condi·t ions which precluded certain de irable cientific 1'e(luirements such as identical material for all beams.
1. It i a.pparent that beams of fir can be produced which, ,,-eight for weight, will prove
as strong a those made of spruce, but will not, howavrI', show quite the same tiffnc's ;
fmther, that cypres can not be considered a a satisfactory sub ,titute for spruce. (Cf. data
on beam 1 to 15 solid beams; beams VII and VIII of laminated construction.)
2. On the basis of equal section moduli the rectangular cctions are stronger than the
oblique sections. (Cf. data on beam 1 to 15 olid.)
3. Beams made up of three pieces can be produced which will be as strong a the olid
beam construction. While these test indicate that a larger variation in strength may be
expected with the three-piece beam, uch variation is apparently not more than that which is
ordinarily expected with wood construction. The olid beams with which the three-piece
beam were compared gave remarkably consistent trengths for wood construction.
4. Beams of the laminated con truction can be buil ,,-hich will be as strong as the onepiece, (olid) construction.
5. The detail of construction employed in threc- ieee and laminated construction have
a la.rge influence on the strength of th fillished beam:
(a) r['hree-piece and laminated beams are not weakened ,,-hen properly ·pliced. Scurf
joints only are permissible for splices. Butt joints are unsati ,fa tory. A suitable scar f joint
is made by cutting the end to be pliced with a ' lope of three-fourth in 10; these ends are then
overlapped and glued. CCf. beam. J-5 to 1-19 and remarks on heams 1. to IV, XVI to XVIU,

(b) The laminations should be relatively thick and preferably not less than one-eighth
inch thick. It will be noted by comparing the "specific strengths," given on summary curve,
with the corresponding beam sections that the beams with thicker laminations have the higher
specific strengths.
(c) Web and flange reinforcement of dense-wood veneers increases the strength of the
beams decidedly. Many of the failures were mainly web failures, due to horizontal shearing
stresses. The reinforcement of the web by a centerpiece of a dense-wood veneer having its
grain placed vertical would prove efficient reinforcement against horizon tat shear failures; and
this fact is no doubt largely responsible for the increased strength shown by beams thus constructed. (Of. compare beams XV, XVI with XVII and XVIII and beam XII with XIII and
XIV .)
(d) Beams of glued construction are apparently not weakened by continued vibrations.
(ef. tests of beam X.)
(e) Glued constructions are as strong in shear as the wood from which they are made, even
when the beams have been exposed to moisture.
(j) Built-up beams will show stiffness equal to that of the solid beams only when the construction is of the highest type.

REMARKS ON TESTS.

Solid beams of Bureau of Standards shop (Nos. 1 to 15).-All solid wood beams of spruce and
fir (Nos. 1 to 12) failed in compression. Beam No . 2 was a poor specimen as it contained a pitch
pocket; this accounts for failure at such a low load. The solid beam of cypress wood, o. 14,
failed in tension and horizontal shear. Cypress beam No . 15 failed in tension.
Solid beams from Naval Aircraft Factory ( os. 1-6 to I-ll).-Each of these beams failed in
compression. The compression failures in beams 1-5 and 1-7 were followed by horizontal
shear failures. These beams ran quite uniform, as is shown by the values for" specific strength"
on the summary chart of results.
Three-piece beams from Naval Aircraft Fnctory ( os. 1-12 to I -19).-Each of these beams
failed in compression. Failure was not due to splices in the case of the spliced beams (Nos. 1-14,
1-15,1-18, and 1-19). While these beams do not run as uniform in strength as the solid beams
above, the variation is not greater than is to be expected in wood. Moreover, the average
specific strengths of the three-piece beams is a trifle greater than for the solid beams.
Laminated beams.- Beams I and I II of spruce and II and IV of cypress failed in compression. These beams were poorly constructed. A number of laminations in each beam were
spliced; the splices were butt joints which were not closely bu tted. Consequently failure in
each beam occurred at a lamination splice.
Beams V and VI were better constructed and were equal to solid wood in specific strength.
Beams VII and VIII of cypress wood failed in tension. The wood in these beams was of
poor quality and app eared to be decayed .
Beam No. X failed in compression.-B eam No. X was given a vibratory or repeated stress
test before being subjected to the regular tr ansverse test. The purpose was to determine
whether or not the stiffness or strength of the beam would be affected by a test of this nature.
The results indicate that the vibr atory test had no effect upon the beam. The vibratory test
was not of a very severe nature. This beam failed in compression at the center, and in shear
over the entire length of the web. The beam contained no splices in the l aminations.
Beam No. XI was a rear wing beam of a larger section than the other beams. This beam
carried an exceedingly high load.
Beam No. XII, although classed as a laminated beam, is quite different from the others.
The birch lamination or veneer in the center has the grain running in the direction of the depth
of the beam section. This beam was bowed laterally to the extent of -h inch at the center

and the left side of the section was cracked in the web from the birch veneer center to the ou tside for the entire length, as shown in the photograph. The left side was on the convex side
of the bow. In spite of these defects, this beam carried a very high load, which shows that this
is a very good type of construction.
Beams XIII and XIV both failed in compression. While these beams were not as strong
as some of the preceeding ones, they are practically equal in strength to the solid wood beams .
Beams XV and XVI were not as strong as solid wood beams . This was evidently due to the
facts that the lamination splices were poorly made and that the laminations are too thin. Failure
occurred at lamination splices .
Beams XVII and XVIII are equal to solid wood beam. These two beams contained poor
lamination splices, practically the same as beams XV and XVI. The superiority of these beams
over beams XV and XVI was due to the mahogany caps on the top and bottom and the
mahogany veneer in the center. Failure occurred at laminat,ion splice .
Beams XIX and XX were inferior to solid wood beams even though they had mahogany
caps and veneer. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that the laminations were too thin.
Beam XIX failed at a lamination splice, but XX did not.
Beams XXI and XXII were built similar to beam XI. Both failed in compression; failures
occurred very slowly. These beams were both inferior to solid wood beams. This was probably
due to the high moisture content as is shown on the chart of results .
Beam o. XXIII was built similar to beam XXII, and in addition each half of the section
was spliced, splices being located at points of maximum moments . This beam proved to be
inferior to solid wood beams due to poorly selected wood and not to the fact that it contained
splices. The spruce wood was grained diagonally, the grain sloping 1 in 10; the veneer was
soft gum wood having a low shear strength; and the caps were of ash, which is not suitable for
this purpose. The results of this test demonstrate that this type of beam can be spliced without
causing a weak point.
