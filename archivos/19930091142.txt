REPORT No. 81.
COMPARISON OF UNITED STATES AND BRITISH STANDARD PITOT·STATIC TUBES,
By A. F.

ZAHM

and R. H. SMITH.

PREFACE.

It has been stated by some experimenters that the standard pitot-static tube used by t.he
United tates avy does not, at all airplane speeds, give the arne differential pressme as the
British standard pitot- tatic tube. Since the readings of these two tubes form the basi of
comparison of a part of the British and American aerodynamic data, it was deemed advisable
to calibrate them with reference to one another at all available wind tunnel speeds. Thi was
accomplished in the 8 by foot tunnel constricted to 4 by 4 feet and giving a fairly uniform air
flow at all speeds up to 160 miles an hom. The table and illustrations were prepared by Mr.
G. C. Hill.
DE CRIPTION OF TUBES.

Fig. I, 2, 3, and 4 give the general exterior appearance of these instruments and the structmal drawings of their nozzles. In hape both nozzles consist of round oaxial tubes terminating in a hollow conical no e with fine external taper as hown in the figme. The avy
tube has the steeper taper and the greater number of static holes in the external pipe. The
hole in both are 0.040 inch in diameter. Both nozzles are attached to stream-line shanks
which convey the static and impaet pressmes, respectively, to the opposite leads of their
manometer or pressure gauges. The theory and general structme of such tubes n,re too well
known to require detailed explanation.
MANNER OF TESTING.

During calibration the tubes \yere plated abrea t in the 4 by 4 foot tunnel, equally distant
from each other and from the 'mil, and supported from their shanks which ran vertically
upward through the ceiling of the tunnel to liquid alcohol manometers having a 1 to 5 slope.
Vibration was prevented by a fine wire attached to the lower ends of the hank and to the
side walls. During the te t the Briti h tube wa made to read e,en miles per hour from 20 to
] 60, by increments of 10, and the corre ponding pre ure difference for the other tube was
observed at the arne in tant, at the time when both reading were teady. Mter a complete
and ,careful run, duly checked, the tube were interchanged in position, and a complete new
run was taken with the Briti h tube till made the in trurnent of reference. The mean of the
speed indication of the a,y tube, ob erved at anyone peed in the two po ition ,wa taken
as the true reading, or what would be obtained in a uniform and homogeneou current.
By means of a hook gauge, the two manometer tubes were calibrated to 0.001 of an inch of
water simultaneously and under the arne pressure, allowance being made for the de cent of
the alcohol in their re en·oir . A een from Table I and Fig. 5, the two traight gla tube
of the in lined manometer were of uncommonly uniform diameter, except where a weld in
each tube was made during eonstruction. Both were of German glass 3/16 of an inch in
diameter. The meniscus could be located accurately to 0.01 of an inch.along the tube, or
1/500 of an inch in vertical displacement, thus enabling the difl'erential pressme in the nozzles
to be read truly to less than 1 per cent at 20 mile per hom and till more accurately at higher
speeds.

RESULTS.

Fig. 6 give the final calibr ation data for the t'wo tubes. When the corrected air speed indications of the United tates avy tube are plotted to the same linear scale, against those of
the British tub e, a a basis of reference, the data all lie on a straight line whose slope is unity.
I t had been alleged that the somewhat steeper cone of the avy nozzle caused too low pressure
in the static hole. From till diagram, however, it appear that the air speed readings of the
two instruments are identical to the accuracy of indication of either instrument.
REMARK.

It seems most de irable that a standard pitot-static tube be accurately calibrated at all
speeds used in aerodynamic research. The precise calibrations thus far made have stopped far
short of the speeds available in modern wind tunnels and aircraft.
