noise is not the only disturbance to be dealt wi~ zdthou h perhaps
the most important, because the staccato barks of open ex%met carry
to greater &stances than the other attendant nok
It is, however,
not a matter of great dMiculty to so far suppress these barks that the
exhaust noise ceases to be the most rominent in rekdiion to some
others. As a matter of fact, a simp1? pipe of sufficient len

will
do this for the high-speed multicylinder enginq and we un Perstand
that some hmrican and German pkmes are uwng this scheme. It
serves at least to protect the operator, even if it does not go a great
way toward actually suppre&ng the pulsations as far as an observer at a distance is concerned. The very fict that the impulses
follow so rapidI upon one another seems to make the problezn of
taking off the U; ark” easier, for we found it much harder to mu5e
single-cyIiuder slow-speed _.
Assuming, however, that a successful device for completely muffiing the e@aust can be found we should still have to deal with
other noises such as the hum oi? the pro eller, the singing of gears,
and the rat~e of the valve gear. It will %3admitted that all of these
sources of noise can be mimmized, but elimination does not seem to be
in the reahn of possibiliq.

the arm. The same sort of humming note can be identified in connection with planes in flight at considerable altitudes and distances.
To silence tlus disturbance presents a problem on which at present
the writers have no suggesho~ except that slower speed (geared)
propellers might heIp...
&other source of noise is in the valve gear. In the case of the
engine under test this consisted in a sort of rattling hiss at high
eds It can be easily identified when the obser-rer is close by.
Tn lanes of flight at some distance from the observers the noise
wo $ d appear tmbe drowned in the exhaust roar and in the hum of
the propeller. In any case this disturbance can be minimized by
accurate adjustment. But it is dMcult to see how the valve slap can
be entirely eliminated.
The last source of noiw is in the gears. This can be partly suppressed at least by the use of spiral gearing and by accurate machine
work and mountmg.
These four sources of noise are the principal ones requirin attention. We would place them in order of importance: (a) l!!xhaust r
noise, (b prope~er noise, (c) valve-gem noise, (c?) ear noise. We
believe t 1! it is most important to su press the S4 aust noise, beat
cause its staccato barks will undoubte1ly adver~ise the rising of a
plane sooner than the other three b reason of As water carrying
wer. But the problem of the oti er noisw remams; and we are
K rther of the opinion, based on our experience in the past year, thtit
the exhaust noise can be so far suppressed with comparatively simple
means that itiforms the mnallest source of the ihsturbance of th~
four. We will not ~enture to predict complete aup~ression. Amy
muiller construction in connection with its manifold wdl have to take
in some one of ita parte the full force of the original blow, and since
lightness of construction is one of the requirements calling for thin
-walls the chances are that there will always be more or less of a
puhiating roar, at least near the engine. We have so far not reached
the eta e of considering this part of the problem.
Co n& ing our attention now to the articular problem in hand,
the silencing of the exhaust, a successL device will have to meet
three requirements: (a) Satisfactory my ression of noise with least
back ressure, (b) Ii htest possible wel&t, (.) greatest durability.
For t f e last year we f ave.confined our attention to the first of these,
believing that the other two could be successfully met if the first
requirement were satisfied.

The state o.f erfection at rwent reached in the muffling of autoengines is well L! OWL As ? ar as this pr~blem is concerned, it may
be consid~red. salved as regar+ suppression of noise. Not a greatdeal of sae?tdic data are avadable. Some tests were carried on at
the Univerdy of Michi n, an abstract of the.re ort being published
in the Horseless Age for% ay, 1915. Five types o $ mufllerswere tested
and invwti ted as to back prwsure, horse~wer 10ss, and rnuflling
ability. O r the five, the cme given the lughest rank on all three
counts has the construction shown in figure L The engine used was

itive. On the other handl serera~ observers @&ed that the Iarger
muflier more e.electivelyqmeted the exhaust nome. The two, however,
are so close together regarding this point that it became W%cult to
judge of the &fference in connection with the other noises. Our conchmon is that both mdilers are good with resyect to uieting and
that the greater eficienc~ of quieting in the Iar er mu3?er is bo~ht
at too great an increase m the back pressure. $ e hare no hesitation
in saying that the smaller mfler is as good a schtion of the problem
as we have yet seen.
III. T3E EXPERIMENTS.
Experiments -withdevices constructed by us were carried out partly
on a. singIe-cyIinder slow-speed machine, partl on a 60-hormpcrwe.t
4-c linder kkirn engin~l and lastly on an
L- der Curtis engine.
h e principle underlying the action of m “ g is simple. At the
%
moment of opening of the exhaust valve the pressure conditions are
such that the gases issue at mlocitks of approximately 2,000 feet per
second. The problem is to reduce this velocity ‘beIow that of sound
~~~k~o~~e~er second) without causing undue back pressure. The
exhaust is due to the ming of the gases at mlocities higher r an that of sound, and the main disturbance is suppressed as soon as the ~&locitiesare brought below 1100 feet per secend. The means at hand to accomplish this are: a) Ckding of the
gases to reduce volume, (b) gradual expansion, (c\ internal frktion
and eddy currents in the gasl ~d (d) frictional resistance bet-iveen
gases and containers and bafk
Of these the first mentioned is
practically n ligible, as the degree of cooling can not be great in
5
the time availa le.
TO bring into Ia the other three means would require a construction having the !03 owing essentials: (a) An mtra.nce chamber se-reral times the cyIinder volume, to allow of the unrestricted transfer
of the ~ases from the cylinder to this chamber, for the purpose of
pre-wntmg undue back pressure, and (b) one or more expansion
chambers so provided with bdlles as to break up the gas currents in
such a manner as to cause decreasing ~e@ity by means of both expansion and friction.
& far as application to the en “ e is concerned, three solutions are
ossibk. The &t is to use in%?
“viduaI mtiers for each cyIinder.
$ his ~heme at first sight @ a good deaI.in its favor, but n on
analy= se-remdprohibiti~e disadvantages wdI appear. h. the A&4
place, there is no doubt that, sa~, 8 snd mufilers will vregh more
than 2, each taking care of 4 c Imdem Ih the case of the commercial muffler above mentioned, ti e weight re~ation is 15 pounds for 4
individual mtiers to 6 pounds for the singIe muftler doing about
the same work Further, the adrantage that a 4-oylinder manifoId
wiII in itself act partl as a mutBer is lost, and we vvould have the
individual bark of eaci @rider to deaI with. And, fiaIIy, where
the scheme had been tied k w-asfound ve~ diilicult to properly stay
so many muillers as to ~revent dangerous mbrations.
The second scheme IS to combine manifold and nmfiler, i. e., to
internal$ construct the manifold to convert it into a com Iete mufsight; but in o rl er to pro.

diameter, since the latial distance between cylinders is restricted,
and it is a question whether it is desirable to place so large a heatradiatin surface next to the cylinders and the structural members
of the p7 ane. The question of adding weight at that height from
the base to the side of the cyIindera is aIso of importance with relation to possible excws-ive vibratiom We tried one scheme of this
kind on the Maxim engine, as below noted, but with doubtful success.
The third scheme is to use a regdar manifold and to connect this
by means of flexible hose to the mtier pro er. This allows of any
convenient lacing of the muftler with re?erence to engine and to
operator. A e len h of exhaust hose is of no importance consistent
onl with low bacF pressure, and, given this a considerable length
of z oae or pipe is a ~ositive help to the mu~er. We believe on all
counts that this combination is the best sciution.
The fist experimental construction embodied the idea of making
the entrance space a Centrifugal whirl chamber in which the gases
were to lose part of their kinetic ener~ by mutual interference
before passing out through hoIes or slots m a central pipe. It vms
made up out of a 4-inch tee, the side branch o! which was ~pped
and the cap then bored and threaded for the l+mch exhwst pipe, of
a 6-horsepower oil engim” The opening from this pipe was placed
eccentrically in the cap, so that the gentered the 4inch tee tan-~
gentian . One of the strai ht-run o~qn.mgs o: the tee was Iuggyd,
%
while t Ke other w-as bushe to receive a 1~-mch pipe. +’he pipe
could be extended varying distances,igto the tee by a long thread.
Tests were made with this central pipe not perforated in any w?y,
but open at the end. The best reaultk -were found when th~ lpe
extended to within + inch of the op oste plug. Later the en% o~
the central pipe was plu~ed and t{ e pipe perforated with holes,
a second one was then treed rforated with slots. In these cases
the g% after whirling arounr in the .&amber found its wa into
the central pipe through the holes or. sIots anA So on out. i 11 of
these devices were only moderatdy successful and did not seem to
promise much.
It was then thought de.sirable to improve +e entrance conditions
to the whirl chamber by gradual~y br~deru~
the entrance pipe,
thus introducing the gas tangentially m a mde band. Figure 8
shows the construction. Three concentric central pip% a 4-inch,
a tl-inch and a 2-inch were used, the lattgr being open to the air at
both en~
The central ipes were slotted, the 4-inch and S-inch
ipes as in fi~re Vat tEe Zinch pip as in figure &b. It was
r ound that the direction of the slots m the inner pi~ caused the
gas to move out of one end of the pipe, creating a d~tinct suction
cm the other end. This device ehovr@, up much better than the
crude first construction. It was estimated to cut out 80 per cent of
the noise. Back-pressure readings -were not taken, as we were as
yet mainly interested in noise reduction.
The succew of this device on the particularly vicious bark of the
oil engine on which it was used led us next to construct a combined
manifold and muffler of this type for the ~faxim engine. The main
features of this muffler were: A.n expanding, flattened nozzle from
s tangentially into the shell, a common
each cylinder to lead the
annular chamber between t e largest insded pipe and the sheIl into

which the exhaust from all cylinders &t entered, a series of four
pipes 2, 3, 4, snd 5 inch, with perforations ~ arrangd- that the gas
must &t pass through the wtdl of the 5-Inch pipe n a slanting
direction, and having attained a certain velocity m this direction
must turn and pass th.rou.ghthe 4-inch in the opposite direction bes. bother turn was neqry
to pass
cause of the sIotted op
through the 3-inch, andY
fins y through tha 2-inch to the atmos~here.
We did not succed in
tting a very good idea of the action of
this manifold mrdller, as tr e Maxim engine, which had been loaned
us, was recdkd.
The trial run made promised fairly well, but the
end joints between the pipe were not tight and considerable gas
escaped. & built, with a cassiron jacket, this mdler proved esceechngly heavy.

We have not done anything more with the manifold mfle~
but
intend to try out one or two other ideas, which, hoverer, hare so far
reached onIy the design stage.
The last work was done on-an entirely di&went type from thet
above described. The underl
idea in this typ is to provide an
am le receiving chamber, and
%
n as the gases work toward the
ouJ et, to promde gradually increa.tig resistance, until the pulsations are toned down and the gas &es in stre~
of f airly eotiant

The scheme was tried out on the 8-cylinder Curtiss engine, Two
manifolds of lightweight steel were cross connected by another manifold, so that we finally had a sinde discharge and only one experimental mufller had to be built. The construction of this is shown
in figure 4.
We adopted for this ~utller the prismatic form for two reasons.
In the first place, it is easier to construct than the circular form; and
secondly, we beheve that this form may have some advantages o-rer
the circular form for stowim away on an airplane. The essential
features are as follows: Gra f urdl~ expanding entrance nozzle ~, a

This muffler was connected to the outlet of the cross manifold by
a short piece of flexible metallic hose and in parallel with a quickclosing gate valve. By this means the exhaust could be instantly

and the back pressures mere observed by means of mercury manometers connec~d ta the side manifolds near their connection to the

Trials with this mutller showed the following:

with the cross manifold showed about 0.3-iuch Hg. at rated output
of 70 horse~ower.
(b) The-a plication of the mufiier raised the back pressure only

about .. . O.1-inc Hg., which is a very good resuk. The power km is
negEgible.
(c) & far as mding is concerned, three observers judged that
the exhaust noise was cut out to the extent of about 50 per cent.
We believe that the mutllirw eticiencv of this construction can be
improvedl and -wehave alrea~ started lo -work out an improved d+
si=gn. The virtual absence of %ack pressure is the most encouraging
feature. Objection has been made to this desi~ on the score of carbon clogging of the tie gauze. OnIy a sermce run of some hours’
duration can pro-m this point.
At present -ireha-ie not used any quantitative schane of nudging

ser~ers. This scheme is not -w oily successful on account maid of
the other noises present beaides the exhaust. & a matter of f act,
to get any idea at sII of this matter in connection with the Cur&s
engine, it became necesary to extend the pipe throu h a window and
to place the mtier outside of the building. In t f e Thrkwsity of
hlicbigan tes@ abo-ie quoted, besides using independent observe~, a
telephone was used, the observer in a room some distance away noting
the distance between himself and the telephone at which he faiIed to
d@nguish the exhaust noise. The receiver was placed near the ene. What such a scheme wouId show in our cass is problematical,
