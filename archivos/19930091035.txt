Due to &e influence of skin frictio~ edd “ g, etc., a

of the fluid surrounding it. The effwt of this is to reduce the

In addition to this effectthe forward movement of this body of”
fluid reduces the actual advance of the propelIer through the surrounding medium thereby reducing the propeller horsepower.
