RESUME

*

The author remarks that the opinions on the theory of the propellor prevailing at the time he read h2s Paper, consisted in aesumtng that the waste of motive power used tn working a propeller
iB proportional to the relative slip, and that, t&reforebt::s::P
should be diminished, as Iiwge a measure as possible.
in
to determine a propeller by ta~ng the resists
of the SUP ~
its speed, two method& may be empUYed:
1st. ‘loincrease the ar~a of the propeller and especially
its dimeter.
2nd.

TO zeduce &he pitoh of a pPopeller of given diameter.

In this connection there are definita iimit@g considerations.
AeIregards the dismete~ of the propellar, We are liaited by the
amount of space available, and as regards the reduction of pitch,
by the ~fi~ of rotation convenient or safe to give twthe engines.
Uixierthese cozxiitons the author asks: “Would an unlimited
i
area of propeller be theoretically valuable?” Wow much do we lose
by the Imitation of area $mposed by mere practical convenience?”
adding that he considers
that a very exaggerated importance 18 =~tached to slip.
In fact, considering that the reduction of slip i. obtained
either by increasing the area of the propeller,or by increasing the
number of revolutions, we see that both these methods lead to an
increase
of fr$ction which oannot be neelected.
“But however confidently ma the strength of known data we
might assure ourselves of the great 10ss of power Involved in surface friction, we cotid not thereby arrive at any def%nite data
as to the pattern
arxi dimensions of the ccrew wMch would on the
unless
we could bring also into
whole minimize the waste of power,

the pressure

‘An emtnent mathemat hian of the day, Lord Rayleigh, has deter&rnd the law on stremnlins Srinoiples,
rigorously
so far as pressure

@
iS the angle between the plane and the line of motion.
b~t appe=s pretty conclusively, “however,
by Beaufoy’s experiments that, when the plane %s moving normally tihrou@ the water, so
that @ = 90°, the reetstance aotuelly experienced exceede P in
the ratio of 112 to 96, and it is not improbable that a proportionate
excess, beyond P as given ~ Lord Rayleigh’s formula, will be experienced also when the ~tion is obliqus; and in the calctiations I
have made I have assumed this to be the case.
‘As regards surfxe friction, the experiments I have conduoted
for the Admiralty show that it varies about as the power 1.85 or 1.9
of the speed; but for cozwenience
we m~ adhere to the usual expression that it varies as the sqvare of the speed. The coefficient or
frictional force per square foot at unit speed, varies greatly with
the length of the-pl~- in the line of mot~oa &d with the qpality of
the surfaoe.
‘“W pressure and the friction may be respectively expressed by
the eguations P = p A v2 sin
@
,and F= f A V2, where p
f are respectively the pressure and the friction
per unit of
surface, A the-area of-the piane, v the speed in the-line of motion,
and @
the angle between the plane and the line of motion; and if
we take the forces in pounds, the area in square feet, end the speed
in feet per second, the available data suggest 1.? (1) as the value
of p, and 0.008 as tile value of f. bearing in mind, as regards
that the
the latter figure, that it provides for the circumete,aace
the area of a screw blade has a double surfaoe, the baok and the front;
and that it is appropriate to a fairly smooth surface, measuring 3
feet in the Mne of motion. 1 must, hchrever,add that although tt is
very important
to be pretty
correctly informed as to the true measure both of surfaoa friction and of normal pressure, so as to be
assured that w are dealing with real and tangible mounts ani not
‘with shadowy tendencies, the investigation, even when carried out with
the mere abstract coefficients,
proves In the highest degree interesting and instructive.

lst. The useful power equal to the product of t’hrust and speed.

!he power corresponding to the work of the component of
friotion following &he axis of the propeller.
4th. The power correspondingto the work of the oomponent of
friction, following the perpendicular to the axis.
The sum of these four terms constitute the propulsive power. (1)

On Fig. S, the values of these four terms, the useful p~wer beconstant and equal to 20000 x 24.2 = 482bs/ft/sec., have
been laid off in curves in function of the slip.

These curves enable us to note that the power due to slip deof
oreases as slip decreases, but that the powers dm to components

power passes through aminimun.

NOTES
1. - It is interesting to translate the expression given by Froude
for the elements of the reeultsnt of the action of the pter on a
plane into”
the notation eqloyed in aviation and especially into the
notation of the Eiffel Laboratory, by assuning that the forces are
proportionate to the specific weight of the fluid, that is, that they
are ia the ratio of 800 to 1.
Froude?s formulas are:
p=p

AV2

Sin@

F = fAV2
where P is the component normal to the plane and F the component
directed either tangentially to the plans or along the trajectory;
p and f are the coefficients the value of which, for the water is:
P = 1.7, (l), f = 0.008, the units being the powd, foot, and
sscond.
A is the area of the plane, i9B the angle of attack, and
V the speed.
The factor for transforming the coefficients (lbs/sq.ft/ft/sec.
into the coefficients (Kg/sq.m/m.sec.)i.s52.5 for the water and
52.5/8@ = 0.0656 for the air. Thus for the W?@ERwe have:
