Instances where this

difficulty appears to have been surmounted are thus deserving of careful study.
In this regard, the

det ~i ls

of design of certain for -

eign engines, whose high avero.ge efficiency hi:l.s received
much publj.city are of particulCl.r interest.

In an examina-

tion of these engines at the Bureau of Standards, the unusual type of ai r-fuel r a tiO control suggest ed itself a.s
a possible source of the high efficiency.

In the over-dimensioned engine, parts are designed
for the stresses of full throttle operat5.on at a certain
altitude and the t h rottle closed so a s not to exceed this
power at lowe::- o.ltitudes.
