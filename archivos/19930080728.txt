THE ART Ol??VRITING SC13XT1FIC REPORTS
By F. H. ITorton
Acting Chief Physicist,
l?ational Advisory Co~mnittee for Aeronautics
The report is the medium by which the results of
investigation and research are conveyed to those people
~~h~ are, or can be, interested in the subject, and llke
all mediums, to be effictent, it should carry it”smessage
as quickly a-rid smoothly as possible.
as
It should not
only transmit the actual data obtained,’ the cold facts
and figures, but It should also carry to the reader a
feeling of confidence in the work accomplished, and
should so coordinate the results with similar work, that
their true significance can be realized.
A well-written
report forms a reasonable and coherent addition to the
worldfs knowledge.
As the purpose of the report is to
tr,aiismit
as smoothly and easily as possible, certain
facts and ideas, to the average person likely to read it,
it must, then,be written in a full and simple enough manner to be comprehended by the least tutored, and still
not be boring to the most learned, of the group who may
be considered as interested readers.
This demands
clearness of expression, a concise though complete treatm6nt, and an interesting style of writing.
Perhaps the most important quality a report can
have is interest, for”if it is not interesting it will
not be read and if it is not read, it has failed in its
purpose.
Of course, some discoveries are of such great
importance that, even though imparted in the most unpalatable form, they are widely and eagerly read, but
these are only occasional instances, for the average
piece of research is not of enough value for many to
take the trouble to read carefully a muddled and dry report of the work.
On the other hand, many will read a
clear and interesting report even on subjects to which
they have before given little thought.
It is easy to
tell an interesting report from an uninteresting one,
but it is more difficult to determine what features distinguish a good report &om a poor one.
The most important feature in the creation of interest is probably

2

,

the style of writing.
Style is a ~ather broad and in.
definite term, and various readers will not agree on
what constitutes a good style, but writing that leaves
the reader!s mind in such a condition that it can uninterruptedly and contentedly follow the meaning of the
report, without being conscious of the words, is what I
should consider a good style.
Like every other piece
of writing the.report should have a definite object.
There should be no digression from it, and there should
be no doubt in the readerts mind what that object is.
Awkward and incoherent sentences, abrupt beginnings and
endings of ideas, and incomplete expression all tend to
interrupt the smooth flow of meaning from the paper to
the mind.
There are, Howeverj certain cases, when, for
the sake of emphasis, it is desirable to bring out a
statement strongly, by an abrupt breaking of the sequence
of ideas, but this method, to be of value should not be
frequently used.
Besides the rather obvious requisites
for good style, there is that rather indefinite quality
that expresses the individuality of the writer.
Some
writers have the happy faculty of making anything they
touch upon interesting, and; although it is impossible
to explain just why this should be, I believe that the
author must be really interested in his subject before
he can interest his readers.
To have a wide influence, a report must inspire confidence.
When a statement is made, it must be based on
something tangible, so that there will be no feeling of
doubt or skepticism as to its derivation.
I do not mean
that no statement should be made unless it is an indisputable fact, for ‘that would greatly, perhaps entirely,
limit them, but enough information should be given on the
methods and apparatus used in experimentation, to allow
the reader to accurately judge of their validity.
For
example, no one would have any confidence in a curve
plotted from experimental data if the actual points observed were not placed on the curve, or at least a discussion of their accuracy included.
Before any serious
experimental work is done, the precision of the observations should be determined, so that it can be definitely
known just what confidence can be placed on the results.
Perhaps the surest way of winning the confidence of the
reader is to reoord the data from two runs taken under
identical~ conditions, the check run serving to indicate
What may be expected in the way of precision in the remaining data.
When, as is often the case, certain conditions not under the control of the experimenter, as for

,

3
examjple the weather, give a couiclerab Ie degree of uncertainty to his resuzts, it should be completely
explained, for the Mast hint of a lack of &rankness’
will defeat the purpose al that report and will leave
any other report by the same writer open to suspicion.
is, of course, unnecessary to emphasize the
importance of absolute integrit~ in any Scientific
writing, and yet it is so easy for even the best intentioned e~perimenter to be unduly influenced by some
preconceived idea, t,hat it may not be ~ut of place to
take up this point.
It is very easy in many reports,
without deliberately altertng the data obtained, to
considerably change the results by omitting facts that
do not substantiate the theory that is trying to be
proved.
There are cases when undoubtedly this is intentionally done, but on tbe whole the writer is not
conscious or any dishonesty, but s~mply has evolved a
certain theqry, and can not conceive of any results
being correct that do not fit in with that theory.
It
is the most diffiault thing in the world to approach a
subject with an open mind and draw conclusions with entire impartiality, in fact Me humatimind is not constituted that way, and only with practise and care can

we approach that ideal condition.
to twist the facts, wherever t~ey have the least flexibility, to fit together into a reasonable whole, and it
takes the greatest care not to twist them beyond the
permissible limits.
It i$ always better to omit a
whole set of data, part of which is in disagreement with
the rest, than to assunie one portion as correct, and
find in further experiments, that the wrong portion had
been published, an embar~assment that I am afraid a good
many investigators have experienced.
It

In order that the reader may understand the report
as quickly and with as little effort as possible, it
should be written clearly.
Clearness depends on several factors~ the .mqst important of which is to write
exactly what is meant.
Zt is very difficult for a person who has studied a certain subject thoroughly, to put
himself’ in the reader~s place, and write V?ith enough
Facts which

that it requires the greatest care to cover all uncertainties that may arise in his mind.
It is often the
case that a person can write more clearly on a subject.
which he is still struggling with, than after he has

4
completely mastered it.
On the other hand, it is
equally injurious to clearness to write too much.
Long
introductions,’ lengthy descriptions and the carrying of’
deductions beyond the limit set by the completeness and
accuracy of the data, all tend to obscure the meaning.
~One of the most common faults in reports is profuseness,
:jisow.emiters having developed the art of expressing a one
v
/
‘sentence idea into a whole paragraph, to a hig’h degree.
‘~Suchspreading tires the reader so that he ol?tendoes
/ /not take the trouble to search a wlnolepage to find the
; iifewsentences of value.
Writing reports with the idea
‘ /(ofcovering as many pages as possible is .an excellent
J
way of limiting its readers to those VJhose time is of
little value.
As in any kind of writing, clearness is dependent
on the three essentials, unity, coherence and emphasis.
A report should not cover too much territory or no one
will take the time to search for the particular part they
want, and any digression takes the mind away from the
main thought.
The writer should not rush into his subject at full speed neither should he take an unduly long
time to get started, or the reader?s interest will be
lost, but he should lead up to his subject naturally and
directly in a few sentences or a paragraph, stating the
reasons for undertaking the report.
It has been the
practise with some writers to summarize briefly their ;
report near the beginning.
This enables one to tell at
a glance just what the report is about, and except for
very brief papers, should always be done.
The material
in the body of the report should be arranged in a logical manner, description of apparatus, methods of testing,
results and conclusions.
The end of a report remains
longest in the readerls mind, so that there should be
placed #he statements which it is desired to give the
most emphasis.
It is good practise in long reports to
place subtitles before each paragraph or group of paragraphs so that any particular portion can be found at a
glance.
After a report has been written, it often happens that the author has some further additions to make;
and instead of rewriting the report, the additional material is usually added in the form of a supplement or
appendix.
This procedure someVJhat destroys the literary
quality of the report, but is sometimes necessary.
It
is, however, a great help to clearness to place in an
appendix any mathematical proofs and computations that
are not absolutely necessary for the understanding of
the report.

photographs and other illustrations are of the

illustrated, especially with photographs will be much
more wfd.ely read than one without illustrations.
A pictvra cr~ates int&esk, because it stimulates the imzginction ai~dbecause it shows under just what conditions
the experirlental work was conducted, givin~ a more personal note to the whole report.
Further than this, a
good illustration is often the quickest way to convey an
idea, and every one likes to absorb MS knowledge with
the least effort.
It often hav~ens that a good illustration will do the work of a vfiolepage of description
aiid in about one te-nth of the reader~s time.
For the
sa~flet
i~eason results should be shown wherever possible in
graphical form, a method that is almost universally used.
Whe-n the results ca-nbe nlotted as precisely as the data
permit, there is no need-of giving the data in tabular

should have a title and a short
explanation, so that the reader can tell at once what he
is looking at without the necessity of searching through
the text, and it is also advisable to place the illustrs.tiofls closely as possible to the portion of the
as
text to which they refer.
There are many writers, sofile ood and some poor,
g
who convey an air of self-importance in their works wlnich \
does mv.ch’to detract from theii~ popularity.
It is right
and m.tural that a man should be proud of a good piece of
WOPk that he has acco-m~lished, but to constantly reinind
th~ rea.d.er
of it, is c&taMly
poor taste.

selves unpopular by not giving credit in the report to
the men who have been working under him dv~~ng its prepar.at
ion.
I\To ne ever gained anything in the long run by
o
withholdhg proper credit, and I am sure they have never
lost by showing the value of their assistants? services.
Y
Another bad habit some writers have is to depreciate the
previous work of others along their Itne, and claim more
ori{~iimlity for their work than the facts will permit.
Sucfiprocedure leads only to unpopularity, and the public
is never fooled for long.
It is well, then, to write in
a modest and straightforward mawner, and to give others
their due amount of credit.

There is always the problem of bringing together
The mathethe so-called practical and theoretical men.
matician rather scorns the engineer who is not versed in
higher mathematics, and t@ engineer, in turn, often regards the mathematicians
work as a waste of white paper.
It is strange how distinctly separated are the two
classes and how few men really sympathize with both.
It can be more or less truly said that the engineers
definition of theoretical, is something he can not understand, and the mathematicians
definition of practical
is something he can not do.
As the mathematician is
chiefly known through his vtiitings, it is important that
he present his ideas in a form that will do the greatest
amount of good; that is, his reports should be read not
only by his fellow mathematicians, but also by the men
who can make use of them in engineering and industrial
development.
Even though a man has the training and the ability
to handle higher mathematics, unless he has the time to
frequently use it, it will soon become difficult for him
to follow carefully the work of others.
Also the engineer is too busy to spend much time on theory, even if
he were able to handle it easily.
There are, of course,
a few men who are practical engineers and at the same
time great mathematicians, but such men are few, as the
average engineer feels that he can better obtain a mathematician to do his work for him than to spend the time
himself.
.

For these reasons, the average scientific reports
should not, as istoo often the case, be so filled with
complex mathematical discussions that real results and
conclusions are so completely obscured that the engineer
can not take the time to find them.
In order to bring
the physical meaning out clearly, plots should be frequently used.
For example a complex equation representing harmonic motion would mean very little to most
people, but a curve of the motion against time would
show at a glance just what was meant.
There are a great many reports whose influence
would be tremendously increased by the reduction of the
number of integral signs and an increase in the number
of illustrations.
Most people will naturally skip
quickly over any mathematics that occurs in a report in
the same way that they would dodge a patch of mud kn the
streetj and if the mud becomes..
too thick they will take

other way, and yet these are the people who cov.ld
the greatest use of the material contained in the
report . ‘On the other hand every one will look at a
pj-ctm-%, especially a photograph, even though they are
only remotely interested in the subject, and often their

Clw’iosity TJliIIe aroused enough so that they will complct;l;~ read the report.
It is much easier to write a

but ~,,fl’len considered that each person readiilg the

b
there is no question of its value.
In the sa:aevJay it
is easier to write an abstract equation than it is to
give 3 clear physical conceptioia of t’herelation, but
the latter wI1l save most readers much tiimeand trouble.
‘There are of course reports vJhich consist primarily
of pui-emathematics, and are of use chiefly to the mathematician, so that the writer can assume that all of his
readers will have suc’han understanding of allied work,
that it will be unnecessary to go into detailed discussion of ‘nisresults.
And there are works of such advanced and original thought that it is impossible to
describe them in terms that would be understood by”aay
except the most illustrious scientists.
Such vJorks as
these are unfortunately in a vast minority, and there
are ver~ few scientific reports that have no material of
direct value to t?aeengineer and the industrial chemist
or physicist.
I* ~flay well to say a few words about the rflechanibe
cal side of re~ort writing, and in doing so it will be
necesoary to d@ess
a bit to the methods of experimentation and. collection of data.
All data should be
collected logically and neatly, and everything should be
labellcd., as what rjja~~ clear and obvious at one time
?,be
may be quite obscure after a lapse of a few months.
Again it is well to work up the data as far as possible
as the vork ~oes on, not only to check up on the valid-ity
of the observaticms$ and.to determtne the completeness
of the ciatarequ:lred, but also tIY,get the results in such
shap~ that they can later be readily combined into a report , and.no pains should ‘oe spared to constantly check
up ths results obtained. in order to detect errors that
miCht’ affect a long series of experiments.
A complete
photo~r:uphic record should be mad-e as the work pl”ogresses,
or it ulaybe n-ecessary later to CO to considerable extra
vork to obtain an illustration.

After all the necessary data have been collected,
it is generally best to construct an outline so that the
methods.used, the results and the conclusions may be

and like all other kinds of careful composition it requires a considerable amount of revision.
It iS of
great value to have the aid and criticism of others in
this stage, as the author loses his sense of perspective
after working for a long time Oilone report.
In conclusion, the p~pose of the report. should be
