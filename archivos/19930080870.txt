EFFECT OF THE REVERSAL OF AIR FLOW UPON THE DISCHARGE
COEFFICIENT OF DURLEY ORIFICES,

~ntr oduction.

In lay ing out apparalius for the la.boratory testing of
superchargers for aircraft ' eng ines ali the Langley Memorial
Aeron~utical

LaOol'atory, i t was found most cOi.1V enient to

rr.easure the air on the inlet side by drawing the air from
the atmosphere through thin pla- orifices at lOi-V" veloci te
ties into a box and thence t hrough a thr ottle into a large
re servoir which in turn ',-,ras in free communicat ion wi tb. the
supercharger .

The crifice coefficients for this condition

were unknown, as the desired type of orifice had been calbrated with the flow from the box into the atmosphere, instead of the reverse direct ion which would obtain with this
apparatus .

The presen~ experiments were therefore under-

taken in order to

obtai~

information re garding the rela-

tionship between the coefficlents for flow in the two direct ions .

Method.
The apparatus used for these experiments is shom diagrammatically in Fig. 1.

When the flow

1JilaS

fror:; 4 to I

(s ee F~g. I ), the blo ~re r maintained ~n air pressure of about
5 II Hg. in the large tank, which

~'JaS

throttled into the small-

er tank and led j.nto the orifice box through a restricted
passage forced by a short
air through the box

i"1a.S

le~gth

of 1/2" pipe.

The flow of

thus freed from the pressure pulsa-

t ions that existed at tbe blo'v\'8r.

Runs With the flow from

1 to 4 (see Fig. 1 ) were macle by reversing the blower, and
consequently the air direotion, by reversing the direction
of rotation of the driving motor .
The method

follo~ed

was to take a series of observa-

t ions with the flow from 4 to 1, and then to take another
similar series with the direction of air flow reversed and
the orifice plates inverted in their places .

With each size

orifice runs were made With the flow in both di rections such
that the pressure drops over the reference orifice, and consequently the rat i os of pressures on the two sides of this
orifice were very nearly identical.

By invertin6 the orifices when the di rection of flow
was reversed the effects of inaccurate orifices were eliminated, since the air always flowed through each orific e in
the same r e lative cirection.

As the orifices were very care-

fully made, this pre caution was

-

to o..ny trregularities in the orifices •

Considerable difficulty was experienced in securing
steady air flow, and the apparatus

~~s

modified several times

before a satisfactory degree of steadiness was obtained.
Readings were not taken for record unless the range of osci11ation of the meniscus in the undamped manometers was less
than 0.4 of 1% of the tead.

The

fi~a1

data consisted of not

less than four Bets of rAadings, for each obtainable combination of the three orifice sizes with four pressure drops,
in addition to a number of

r~ns

made for check purposes, mak-

ing a total of mrer one huncired sets of readings.
therefore believed that

t~e

It is

field was satisfactorily covered

for t1:.e range intended and that the data is truly representative.
As the ratios of pressure on the two sides of the reference orifice> and consequently the coefficients of' dis-

,
,

Charge, were very nearly the same for flow in both directions, a direct means of comparison

v~s

obtained .

When the

flow was from 4 to 1, the amount of air passed could be computed by asing

kr~own

coefficients for the standard orifice.

From this, the coefficients for the reference orifice could
be determined.

By usj.ng these reference coefficient s w
hen

the flow 'n as reve rsed, the coefficients for the standard orifice could be obtained for the reversed flow,

part of the range of these ex:er -

irl:ents the discharge coeff::'cient is not reduced by !!lore than
one per cent by the reversal of flow, and the probable reliability of Durley's experiments is of about the same order,
it a9pears that the reuuct ion of discharge c aused by reversing the dire ct ion of flow could be properly neglected in
