reprcs0nts a stress Kb
2800 kg/cmZ• With somewhat more accurate
pitching the load is carried by mora than the one tooth, because of
the deformation of the loaded tooth. Th~ theoretical stress in the
teeth would be less still if the root and tip of tho tooth were not
made so high, as, for instance. in the Napier gaar (in which to be
sur a the overlap~ing in m ~ shing is reducod), or if the root wer 8 made
spocially thick (as, for instance, by the Maag, Friedrichshafen).
This becomeS espeoially true with the use of oblique teeth (as in
the Hispano-Suiza), to which class belong herring bone gears and aroshaped gears, since in these the tooth pressure is distributed uniformaly on an oblique line running from the root to the tip of the
tooth. The stressos ar~ worse, however, if the teeth bear unevenly
as a result, for instance, of warping in hardening, untrue keying or
poor forming. Too small a radius of tha root is a more common defect,
and on account of the scoring action is vary dangerous. All these
circumstances must be considered in determining the bending stress
or the value of Pu

In general, tooth failurds rarJly app~ar in the captured engines
and in those inst~~c~s where they have been found they might have occurred in landing. However t sufficient bending strength can be easily obtained even with strai5ht cut gears.
The compres81ve strength, which mi~ht be called the pearin~

opposing curva~ tooth faces must never exceed the elastic limit if
no perm&'.l~nt deformation and consequ.:mtly no wear of thd teeth is to
occur. Thd comprcls8iv~ stre~th also has a direct cff~ct on the

The relative sliding speed of straight tootbad gears is zero at the
pitch or rolling circlo. wbare pure rolliDg of the teeth on one another OCCllrS. At this point the oil is easily squeezed out; metallic contact between the sv.rfaces of the teeth occurs and.. if the elastic limit is excoeded. distortion or wear is unavoidable.
In order to compare the bearing strength of stra.ight cut gears
with tho results of oxperience with baarings one can compute tho rela.tive tooth curvature of the teeth at the rolling circle. For involute teeth the radii of curvature of the t eeth at the rollIng circle
are the d..istances a 1 and 92 between the central point C and the
tangent points G1 and GZ of the taogents to the base circle s (sea
Fig, 1). The relative curvature of the teeth accordingly expresses

This is lubricateu, liKe the bearings, from the shaft and partially by
oil from '.."ithout, but tho oil thrown oft flows b;.ck into the "dry"
crankcase. In the Wolseley Hisf ano-Suiza gear (No . 10) a var y heavy
J lubrica tion is proviued by a special oil pump which squirts the
oil into the point where the teeth mesh through a slit in a pipe.

The gears should. not be lubrica.ted so hea.vily that the oil
haats up as the result of a sort of churning. rus ma.y occur either
because the walls of the case are too close to the g&ars or because
the oil is caught between the faces of wide gears and forced out
sidewise with great force. In either case unnecessary friction is
:produced w;.th heating and thinning of the oil aDd a corresponding
loss of powe~. The more the dissipation of tbe beat generated can
be left to the metal parts and the air the better for the gear
drive and Us effiCiency".

Erecicion of Manufacture.

The peripb8ral speed Vu is & quantity- frequently used in comparing gear. wheels. It becomes more ioopo~tant the mo~e defects there
are in the transmission ratio due to inacc\l.'ra.cies in pitch or tooth
forms. Inaccuracies in the teeth can be very plainly recognized
with the Ba'~rer gear testing machine. By courtesy of the Zalmradfab...
rik FrieQ~iehshafen (Friedrichsha!sn gea~ factory) several diagrams
from this machine are reproduced in Figs. 3 to 7.
(The Saurer gear testing machine tests gear wheels of any ratio.
Two accurately circ111aJ~ pulleys, which are connected by a steel belt,
provide an exact tre.l.lsnti.ssion wi thout play or backlash wi th which
the actual transmisGj.on of the gear wheels is compared.. If the toothing is iree from ina,(:cUl"acies the pointer of the ma.cbim draws a circle or, if the p~.leys have not the preCise ~atio of the gears, a
spiral. The rad i .e",l \~ai:'iations f170m the spiral correspond to tangentia.l va~iations of the center distancas magnified 200 times, and
therefo~e show the angular error.)

The diagrams bl:'5.ng out in a. striking Il18.llIl!)r the defects of the
transmission which mey be Caused either by inacc~ate setting of the
gear wheels in manufc.ct'Ul'& or erection, or by inacclll'a.cles ~.n the dividing plate or gear cutting machine. but espeCially by shrinking
when hardening. Besides these there occur in the gear drive itself
e!'rors due to bending of the shafts or shifting of the unequally
heated g~ wheels. Defects in the transrrdssion ratio Cause movements back and forth of the teeth. the blows fram which are divided
between both gea,l."s in proportion to the f::ictional and. inertia resiStance. Bestdes these there also OCC'llr reCiprocal displacements of
the gea1' ceniars as a. !'esul t either of play in the bearings or springing of the shatts. An error of .01 IUD . at the periphery would cor" respond to a. cen";er displacement four times as great or 0.04 rom. If
;
the mass of ona gear is very great compal'ed to that of the other it
will run on 'UllllOI1ll1y and the sme~ler will ~aka all the variations.
This applies for instance to propeller shafts whose revolving masses
far eXceed those of the crankshaft.

The magnitude of the acceleration press,~es which arise in this
case, can be oomprehended if one considers the time in which tho motion takes plaC'.e. All the motions can be eonsic£red as portions ot
harmQnic vibrations and thus made more oonvenient for computation as
t~ computation of the aecele~ation pressureo Ior these is very simple.

fine pitches (compare the Rolls-Ro~ce gear). The beat means, however, is to increase the requirements as to accura.cy of toothing and
a.ssembly by a.Ccurate rneasurement ..,of defects and a reduction of the
magni tude of the allowable defecta. If, £ or instance, in the example

- 7 The diagrams of too Saurer gear testing machine show that tbe
accuracy of the tranSIllission ratio can be carried very far by grinding.
Accordingly, the gears should either be milled or shaped with the
greatest accuracy and used unhardened with correspondingly reduced
stresses or hardened ~ro'UIld. In ei ther case all gears should be
tested in ords~ that defects ~ be discovered in time.
The clearance {play} betv.een the teeth may be as large as desired
if. or as long as, no chazJge in direction of pressure occurs. If.
for instance, with a mean pf>ripooral pre ssure of 400 kg. Puma,x

800 kg., and we never have umin ~ 0, the teeth remain always in
contact. However, changes in direction of pressure occur practically,
with great irJregularityof torque - for instance, with engir.es with a
small number of cylinders or low revolutions, 1) - with very inaccurate toothing. but espeCially at pe riods of "critical vibration" which
will be discussed later. It is satisfactory in any case if the teeth
have a little play. which should be reduced only to avoid too much
noise when idling ;.\lld in the region of' resonance.

The g6a.rs of tha

Hispano-Suiza engines are assembled with a noticeable clearance so
that after they bave warmed up a sufficient oil clearance will relllaln.
1) Four 4-cycle cylinders (at 1800 ) cause reversals in direction of pressure before the fly wbael for all speeds of revolution,
and consequently, in the gear wheels without fly whaels. SiX cylinders have this effect only at a low torque or with very heavy moving
masses. Consequently, a 6-cylinder airplane ongine can causa reversals either at low r.p.m. near idling speeds or at very high r.p.m.
(witb heavy pistons and high piston speeds). With 5, 7. 8 and ~ore
cylinders with crank angles equally spaced. the piston masses have
no effect on uniformity and reversals can OCC1ll' near idling speeds
only for a smaller ~umber of cyliDders. Naturally, the region of reversals is largely dependent upon the compression ratio, which affects
the negative work.
The reason the mass effects play a part only iD four and si%
cylinder engines lies in the peripheral forces excited in the crank
circle by the mass effects.

11. GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE GtAR-

In the construction of the gear drives for a.irpla.Da engines the
three principal rules of mecb.a.nical engineering apply with special
force:-

I. All load carrying parts - gearing and housings - must be
joiwd together in the m
ost direct manner to obtain strength and

rigidity.
II. Where a. variation in distances bet~en centers is unavoidable as a result of wear, or no exact assemb~y is possible. suitable
provision must be made for adjustments.
III. Where a movement in the gears or housing is "UnaToidablo or
cushioning or yielding effect is necessary, sliding or elastic
joints must be introduced in such a manner that the effect of the
movement or yielding can be accurately determined or computed.

For air propeller drives single or double reduction gear drives
can be used. The single reduction gears can be either spur gaar~, or
internal gears, and as a rule work out Simpler, lighter and cbaaper
than the double reduction drives, Consequently, they are the most
Common (Figs. 8 to 11). Practical experience with these gears and
inspection of the teeth of their wbeels shows tbat heavy wear takes
.
place in all single reduction gears except the Hispano-Suiza (Fig. 11).
in which the teeth generally bear splendidly. 'I'he worst bearing is
in the teeth of those gears in which the driving pinion is fitted
with a bearing on only 000 side of the wheel.
Single reduction gears with internal gearing have not been captured as yet. However, Birkigt, designer for the Hispano-Suiza Works,
has had such a gear pa-tonted in England. (Fig. 12).. A notable feature
is tho attacbment of the int ernal gear housing to the crank case by
an eccentric centering flange which makes it possible to accurately
fix the pla¥. Against the great advantages of the internal gear must
be balanced the diffic~tl in arranging satisfactory bearings on both
Sides of the wbeels. However, satisfactory solutions of this p~oblem
are not impossible .
Double reduction gears with two different pairs of wheels are
principally used wbere tb& pO\\"6r must be delivered in the same axial
line as the crank sbaft. Their construction leads to ~ and varied
solutions, since both pairs of wheels ~y be fitted with internal or
external too thing and in addition ~ one of the three shafts may be
fixed while the other two drive and are driven. In this manner alone
l~ solutions are found which are asssnbled diagrammatically, and for
a transmission ratio of 1 ; 2, in Fig. 13. The solutions are arranged
in the horizontal rows A, BS t and Ek according to the motion of the
intermediate sbaft_

(Rows:as aDd l\. illustrate the plane-tary gears.)
In addition, the
vertical rows 1 to 4 era arranged according to the direction of rota.tion of the shafts. As will be understood all the solutions are
not of the same value for actual construction since in different arrangements the provision of bearings on both sides of the gears makes
more or less difficulty) the space occupied may be very great and the
revolutions of the intermediate shaft may be very high.
For a better comparison the graphical computation has been add9d
in Fig. 13 for each case. According to the wqll kDown ~thod the
r.p~m. of the crank shaft (nk) and of the propeller (n ) have been
s
laid off in magnitude and direction (relative to the fix9d heusing G)
at the point G of tb& intermediate shaft Z) (Pig. 14). If tha.spider
R is fixed to the housing its r.p.m. is zero and its origin coincide~
with G. But, if it revolves itself, With r.p.m. ~ or n
thenR
is applisd at the axtremity of nk or ne (see Fig. 15). fbe r.p~.
n.~ of the intermediate gears relative to the spider R is assuwed
as to magni tude and direction as convenient. If now the extreml ty of
n z is joined to those of D.k and ns the intersections on the spider
indicate the tangent points of the rolling Circles.
In addition the double reduction gear can be constructad with
spur gears or bsvel gears.
The much simpler forms in which both pairs of wheels have on&
wbeel in common form a speCial case, (see Figs. 16 to 19). The form
of Fig. 16 is developed from that of form 41 of Fig. 13. the fonn of
Fig. 17, from A4 • and of Fig. 18 from ~sZ' It will be observed with

this last that the transmission ratio is limited (to about 1 : 1.5).
With the form of Fig. 19 a ratio of only 1 : 2 is possible.

The Rolls-Royce planetary gear is the bast known (~igs. 21 to 23).
In ~ details it is directly representative of the type. It is
represented by the form Bs2 of Fig. 13. The gear a revolves with
the revolutions + Uk of the crank sllaf't, gears b and c with the
relative revolutions +, llz in the spider i, which is more plainly
shown in Fig. 23, and wnich in turn revolves with the reVolutions ns
of the propeller while gear d is held against revolving in the
hOUSing.
The advantage of the double reduction g~ar over the much Simpler
Single reduction gear lies in the perfectly axial transmission of the
power, from which the best condition of loading of the housing - pure
torsion - is obtained. If the power is transmitted through 2, 3 or 4
intermediate gears at equal angles springing of the gear shafts from
unequal peripheral forces or inaccurate tooth forms does not occ~.
Certain arrangements aleo make it possible to use heavy revolving
masses. for instance t those of the intermediate shafts or the larger
wheels with internal toothing, for the impro~ement of the uniformity
of transmission and to avoid reva.xsals of tooth pressures. The principal advantage, however, conSists in the fact that on acCO'lIlt of the
lOad being divided between 2 to 4 int9~ediate gears the tooth pressures per unit of tooth face are very low. Consequently. small pitches

- 10 ...

and small gears can be 'USed wbich in turn have smaller construction .
defects, since the defe cts resulting from inaccurate dividing wbeels
increase with increasing radius. The disadvantage of the double reduction gear is that it is relatively hea.vy and. costly and. makes
great demands on the accuracy or exact adjustment ot the intermediate shafts if all tba gears are to work eq-ually. Finally t the solid
and secure assembly of the gear make necessary a series of connections which do away with the theoretical simplicity of the type.
In accordance with the first law of light ma.ch inery construction -

that all load carrying parts are to be joined together as rigidly
and unvaryinglyas possible - it is best to fit only ball bearings
in the gear case. Then the possibilities of wear and of changing
eenter distances med not be considered, especially if the gears can
be fitted in place with the proper clearance. (Note: Sunbeam fits
even the crank shaft gear in plain bearings.)

The crank shafts of most of the engines fitted with gears ran in
plain beariDgs which might wear. This wa.s especially the casG with
eng.)nas baving Six-throw crankshafts. If a bearing ran hot, probably
the centerline of the cra.nkshaft after the engine had been overhauled
had another position than originally. unless special meane to prevent
it ware provided. Consequently in tba Renault, Peugeot, Napier and
similar eDginas ball bearings were used for the crankshaft and in this
maDner the difficulties resulting from possible chaoge of center distances were avoided. In the Hispano-Suiza engiIlS only the first
crankshaft bearing - which also takes too gear pressure - is a ball
bearing. At each overhaul the slightly worn plain bearings must be
replaced by new ones truly centered..
If i t is net desired. to go to these measures it is 09cessary to
fit a.. joint either in the fixed part, for instance, between crankca.se
and gear case, (Fig. 24) or in the transmission between cranltshaf''i:
and gear (Fig&. 25 and 27), which will either adjust itself automatically while running or can be adjusted in assembly. I f such a joint
adjusts itself automatically, as must be the case when i t is fitted
be tween crankshaft and gear, it also equalizes the expansions dm to
h&a.ting of the crankcaso and. gear case and makes the assemblY' of gear
ancl engine easier. Generally two shafts - or two housings - which
are to remain al~s parallel can be cozmectad. by a sliding cross
linkage K (Fig. 25), a sort of sliding joint S, (Fig. 24), or a
floating shaft W, (Fig. 26).

The method of the slidiIlg cross linkage has been used in the
Rolls-Royce gear - however, in a fixed housing - in a notable manner.
The link (Fig. 22) and e of Fig. 2 1, lies between the outer engine
housing ani the intermediate gear wheel, d, which is beld ill the
housing. Consequently this can adjust itself and. always remain concentric with the crankshaft. The whole set of pla.netary gears also
always remains concentric with the crankshaft - which m;q shift in the
caSing - but not with the casing. The joint betwsen the fiXed gear
wheel and the housing is accordingly adjustable transver sely in a.rq
direction and adjusts itself correctly while the forward bearing g
and h must be adjusted on e ach overhaul of the angina bY' the adJusting screws, £ ~

.~

- 11 ...
In principle this cross link could just a.8 well be placed between
crankshaft and gear. In that case, however, the whole gear would
have to be carried in rigid bearings in tho case, The preceding arrangement saves a bearing and has the advantage that the cross link
does not rotate and consequently can be easily kept in oil. .Besides
it does not have to transmit the varying torque of the crankshaft.
In addition the mass of the internal gear which is directly attached
to the crankshaft helps the smoothness of running.
For the rest the problem of making the joint in the housing adjustablo is best solved either by fitting the gear housing with a
flange which is not concentric OIl the engine housing and which after
every ovethaul can be adjusted and secured. anaw. or h;Y makiDg the
bearings adjustable (Fig. Z7). This new arrangement or the RollsRoyce gear is known only from pa.tent drawings. In it the upper gear
can be adjusted. by eccentrically set ball bearing cages! C and d.
and the lower gear can ba adjusted on the engine shaft by means of
adjusting screws. The joint between crankshaft and gear wheel a, is
a universal one, which is very cunvenient for assembly..
A gear made by the Friedrichshafen gear factory (ZahDraderfabrik
Friedrichslla.t'en) illustra.tes a. method by which the crank shaft can
be separated from the rigid gear set, (Fig. as). At the same time
it accompli$hes the attachment of large rota.ting masses to the
crankshaft. so as to avoid reversals of pressure. and the separation
of the irregularities of the crankshaft from the gear. The utility
of this type of const.ruction depends prinCipally on the sui tabili ty
of the tyPe of COUpUDg used.
When long shafts are used between engioe and propeller it is
best to fit the joints which have been proven by use in automobiles.
Spring or elastic joints have the advantage that they need no
They must. however, be absolutely so perfect that their
elastic distortion compared to t·he angular motion allowed is either
extremely small or accurately doterminate so that their influence on the
vibration freg.ueney of the shaft can be determiIlBd by experiment or
computed. Otherwise they may cause grea.t danger to the security of
the gear and engine as a result of the possibility of resonance vibrations.
l~brication.

I II. PRIMARY VIBRATIONS IN THE SHAFT TRANSMISSION.
The primary vibration frequency of a freely vibrating crankshaft,
resulting from .some passing impulse, is determined partly by the masses
involved - that is the propeller, the pistons, cranks, counter-weights
and gears - and. partly by the springiIlg of the shafts and gears. In
the usual German 6-cylinder engines, with moderatelr heavy air propellers. whose moment of gyration lies between 2Q and 60 kg/m2 the freely
vibrating shaft has a freq~ncy of about 6000 vibrations per minute;
in 4-cylinder engines more, and in the single crank radia.l or revolving about 20,000. Indeed freely vibra.ting six-throw shafts make a

- 12

-yo

greater number of vibrations than the x~& given, because with
tbe masses distributed on the cranks they can vibrate in two or more
nodes instea.d of om. However, these higher frequanciea need never
be practical17 considered.
Various methods can be used xor the computation of the vibration
frequency; for instance that of G8mbel or that of Kutzbach. (Por the
former. see "Zeitschrift des Vereines deutscher Ingenieure n 1912, for
the latter. the sama - 1917.) They can be measured in operation by
the use of the Geiger(3) Torsiograph made by Lebman and Michaelis of
Hsroburg - which requires a degree of practice in its application - or
with the engine stopped. For this a series of light blows at regular
intervals is applied to the c·r aokshaft. The Vibrations thereby excited
in the shaft incre!\se markedly when t~ frequency of tha blows coincides with the frequency of primary vibration of the shaft. (When
gears are used contact under pressure must be maintaiDad by suitable
springs between propeller and crankshaft.) Tbe primary vibrat ion frequency of the crankshaft is of great importance, since in operation
a resonant effect from the POWSlr impulses of the engine itself absolutely must be avoided. In a 6-cylinder four-cycle engine or a 3cylinder two-cycle engine there occur regular impulses with frequencies of tbe thrsefold, Sixfold, ninefold, etc. revolutions, of which
the first are the strongest. In an B-cylindar four-cycle eDgiDe or a
4-cylindsr two-cycla engine the impulses occur at 2, 4, 6, etc. multiples of the revolutions. Consequently. for a 6-cylinder engiDe whose
crankshaft haa a vibrationfrequancy of 6000 per minute the most ~­
gerous speed of revolutions is 6000 ~ 3 or 2000 r.p.m. The next most
dangerous is at 6000 :- 6 ::; 1000 r.p.m. etc. It is important that the
revolu.tions ordinarily used shall lie as far as possible from the region of resonance.
If the diagrams of the individual cylinders are not equal, that
is. if, for instance, in an engine with two carburetors, one-balf the
engine is regularly delivering more po..wr than the other. then not
only are the three and".sixfold revolution freCluencies. impulse frequencies but also the ~'-~ and one-balf · and ninefold revol\\tion frequencies. Thus 6000 : 4-1iZ = 1444 r.p.m. may be dange~oU5. It is
therefore always advisable to keep the priwary vibration frequency of
the crankshaft of 6-cylinder enginas above 6000.

Different builders use elastic couplings between the air propeller
Gasses and the gear masses to improve the uniform t7 of rotation and
protect the gears from torsion. Eut by that the elasticity increases
and the vibration frequancy decreases markedly. In a 6-cylinder engine
for instance it would be extraordinarily dangero~ if the vibration
freClusncy dropped to 3 x 1400 ; 4200 on account of the use of such a
coupling. The shaft revolviDg at 1400 r.p.m. would break. SOODer or
la tar. Likewi se the gear would have no end'Ul"anea.
IX it is c1&sired or is Illicessary to use such a coupling it must
either be made so ~i6lding that the vibration frequency will always
remain high enollgh or it must be made so yieldiIlg that the prin)ary vibration frequency will DOt be reached at any ordinary speed and if poas1 bla not at idl1ng speed. lD any case such coupliIlgs should be care-
