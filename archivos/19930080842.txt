The first of these cond::.tions is due to viscosity and j.s
important especially at low speeds (tests of mojel airpla~es);
tl-:.e second condition is due to tile cOlloide ration of

Now , in existiD.6 labor[;.tories utU.izing a llOrS'3pOWer of

Thus, when a model airplane, for instance, is

~est3d

in

such a laboratory, the streamline wires resist relatively twice
as n:uch , the strut s of the ris-ging c:nd und.ercarri:1g e five
times as much, while the wings ca.rry 30% less on the model

UTILIZ~D.

We cannot appreciably increase Reynolds' Number by increasing either the dia;·r.eter (d) of the tunnel, or the velOCity

v

of the airstream, for the motive pO::ler rec:uired for working
the fan producing the airstream is proportional to

d~·75V2.75

and such increase would therefore lead to insta11at jons much
too costly both as to establishment and upkeep_
Thus ','Vind tunnels are now being planned having a diameter
of 3 to 5

We therefore consider it praferable to work at the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere;

If we assume a mean tem-

perature of +10 0 C., formulas (9) and (8') show that for the
same values of V and N the power is increased by 11% and the
preSSUl'e by

6%,

of equal values of
