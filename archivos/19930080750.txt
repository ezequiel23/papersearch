By G. P.egna.”

In the January number of llLeVie del Mare e dell’ Aria”
Engineer Luigi Acampora takes advantage of the last international seaplane contest$ the victor of which was the Savoia
“S12’1
built by the “Societa Idrovolanti Alta Italian of Se@to
Calende (Milan), make sane ~emarkable statements concerning
to
seaplanes in general and this victor in particular.These statements seem worth repeating integrally in their essential.
parts.
There is a universal feeling that the efficiency of airplanes is greater than that of seaplanes, perhaps because of
the greater head resistance offered by the hull and the necessity of a separate cockpit for the engine of the seaplane,
while for airplanes it is usually installed in the fuselage.
Pegna** and Magaldi~ observes Aoampora, have repeatedly, with
ample te~hnical arguments, demonstrated the inexactness of
this opinion, by showing that the seaplane has little to
covet from the terrestrial airplane.

But here Acampora

adds on his own authority that, by analyzing the effi. .. .

**In acknowledging Acampora’s f“riendly
mention of my’self,
I wish to express the conviction I have held for some time that
the maximum speeds of aircraft above a certain power, will be
obtained by seaplanes.:

fact the constructing firm can be justly proud, all the more
because the S12 was projected by Conflenti at the end of

The S12, in the recent publication o? the Royal WavaI
ACademy of Livorno (Magaldi, “Italian Seaplanes”) was @~ged
“perhaps the best seaplane yet constructed,W to which L’ fleor
nq~tica rejoins that, from a synthetic and objective compa~ison, it is evident that the S12 has the indisputable endow- .,

Desiring to make an an51ysis of efficiency, L~Aeronautic

It is therefore proper to use this fomul.a~ with the
1=

adoption, however, of the following regulations:
!.

a) To classify aircrsft of total minimum load of
about 800 kg.
b) To determine a fixed operating range, corresponding to the mean radius of action adapted to the
aircraft under investigation, namely 800 km.

c) To’assume for all a total hourly consumption of 250g
of fuel and oil per HP in order to aroid confusing
the coefficient of the thermodynamic efficiency of
the e,i@ine.
~
d) To consider that the crew consists of a single pilot
weighing 75 kg.
‘
e) To consider as the commercial load the remainder of
the total load, after subtracting the weight of the
pilot (75 kg) and of the fuel and oil consumed for a
fixed range of 800 km.
We thus obtain the following table, whose data for cal–
Culating the index of efficiency are taken from the last official publication of the fiDirezione
Technics Avia,zionef!Techni(
Ca~

Aviation Administration) for January 1, 1920, and from

other foreign documents.

.
The value, superior to all, of the index of efficiency of

,!

the S12, fully demonstrates our claims

,,

regarding its indisput-

able superiority and, in regard to the high efficiency of seaplanes, that the latter can not be held inferior, apriori, to
terrestrial airplanes. .

The author concludes his communication with the prediction
.

that thesefacts”
will ‘be considered on their merits by those on
whom devolves the great responsibility and the great honor of
I

guiding the fortunes of Italian a~iation at this difficult time,
and that they will favor the development of seaplanes, as is
rendered desirable by the geographic configuration and location
of Italy, in the interest of its commercial expansion and .
