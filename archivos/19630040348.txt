This report is a C'ontillllatio ll of ~ati()llal Alh' i s()I'~' ('omrniLte(' for ~\. (,I'OIl<Wtj('H l{('por(

of upplying fur ther data to the de-;igner of willd Lunncls. Particular emphas iH waf! plllc('d

re ults. It i regrettahle that the voltage supplied to the driving motor was not very con tant,
due to varying loads on the line, hut as thif! motor was of a lightly loaded induetion type, tJ1('
variation in speed was not as l nl'ge ru the varintion in yol Lage . The 'w ork was carri('d on hoth

made between them. It was found that placing radial vancs directl)- h('foJ'c the propC'lkr
actually inc[,eased the cfTi('ien(')' of the tunnel to a C'onsidemhle extent. Th c plaC'ing of a

APPARATUS.

The efficiency of the tunnel and Lhe lip of Lhe propeller were determined hy the arne
method as de crib ed in Report No. 73 , hut to hetter record the flu ctuations in veloeit~, and
direction a recording instrument was constructed. T his instrument, as sh own in Fig,. 1 and
2, ('onsist. of a thin mica diaphragm whose moycment 1'otateH a very light , pindle co nta ining
a small, ilvered m irror. L ight from an illuminatecl slit is transm itted b.y a lens Lo this mirror
and the reflected heam is then focused on a moving photographic film , 0 that an~v movemont
of the mica diaphragm is recorded as a continuous curve. By this methorl any small <111( l
rapid variation in the air fl ow of the tunnel is indicftLed and re('orde(l b)' means of a Pitol- tatic
tuhe which i. connected to the two compartments eparated by the diaphragm, and Hny
change in direction i.' recorded in the samE' wa)' hy connecting the R
ides of n, )"n.whead to
the compartment' on opposite ide of the mica diaphragm. The Pitot and the co nnecting
tube are made comp aratively large so that any rapid nuctuation in "elocity enn he immediately
transmitted to the diaphragm without dampillO' oj' lag. Over ,50 1'e('ords were taken hut oll ly
a fe'" typical ones are reproduced here. Numerou ' exp-erimenl on the efficien cy of tunnels
and on speed fluctuation have previou ly been m ade in England. I , 2, 3

EFFECT OF SIZE OF THE ROOM.

11 the test runs described in Report o. 73 were conducted in a large room, approximating
to free-air condilions. In the Le Ls described ill this report a temporary room was builL ar01.U1rl
the tunnel, representing to scale the huilding provided for the 5-£00t . A. C. A. wind tunnel;
and all runs except tho e shown ill Figs. 3 and 4 were made in thi model room. The cro s
section of lhe model room and the win<1 tunnel are shown in Fig. 5. For the same power this
room decreased lhe air speed from 60 lo .59 miles per hour or a decrease of ]4 ..5 per cent. In
the small room lhe maximum variation of speod was ± 7 per cenL and the maximum variation
in direction wa ' ± 10°. The air speed records show that for the first 20 econds after starting,
in the large room, and for the first 10 seconds ill tho small room, the air peed is very steady,
and that lhe fluctuations suddenly appear at a definite time and will be indicated on the record.
This appearance of 'ueIden fluctuations seems to indicate that the largo part of the speed fluctuations nre due lo the disturbed air from the propeller a it retmns through the room to the
entrance cone.
EFFECT 01:<' RADIAL VANES.

Eight radial vane,; 3 mm. thick and 4:.50 mill. deep were played symmetrically in the exiL
cOile immediately before the ril'opeller. The 'o vanes joined in thl center in a stationery spinner
which wa of the SlUl1e diameter as the propeller base. (Fig. 6.) These vane actually increased
the speed of the air in the tunnel for the same power by 5 per cent, but the fluctuations in direction and velocity remained unchanged. In order to determine what part of the vane gave the
increa eel efftcienc.', 25 mm. ,,,as cut oIr of the outer end of each vane and the run repeated
which gave a 3 per cent incrca c in . peed for the same power over the tunnel with no vanes.
Again the vane were cut oIr on the end 75 mm. and in this ell. e t.he same peed was obtained as
with the tunnel without vanes. This seems t.o show that it is the whole area of the vane which
acts as a traightener for the ail' flow and that no particular part is e pecially valuable in increa<;ing the effic,iency of the tunnel. Eight additional vanes 3 mm. thick were then placed
a.long the inner surface of exit cone, each vane being 75 mm. wide. This distribution of vanes
decreased the speed by 12 per cent for the same power and the variation in speed was ± 6 per cent

and the variation in direction was :l- 10°. The same vanes were then placed in the entrance
cone, as shown in Fig. 7, and in this ca e the speed was decreased by per cent and the va~'iation
in direction was ± 8°. With this type of vane in both the exit and entrance COlle the speed was
decreased hy 20 per cent for the same power and the variation in direction was ± 8°. It is
evident from these tests that the narrow vanes in either the exit or entrance cones are of little
value in any way.
EFFECT OF PLACING SCREEN ACROSS THE TUNNEL.

A section of chicken wire of 25 mm. mesh was placed across the e.·it cone 45 ccnti:rneters ahead
of the propeller. The use of the chicken 'wire decreased the speed by only 3 per cent, 0 it does
not seem that this distribution of screen would be of any great harm to the efficiency of the tunnel
and it is of great usc in preventing small objects from heing dra"""Il into the propeller. A piece
of window screen placed at the beginning of the straight portion of the tunnel decreased the
speed by 14 per cent and the fluctuation in speed was -12 per cent and was - 10 per cent in
direction, showing that the screen in no way helps the steadine of flow for the particular
condition of thi te t. Screens have been used to advantage in other tunnels. ' With window
screen at the mouth of the entrance cone the peed was decreased by only 7 per cent.
EFFECT OF PLACING SPINNERS BEFORE THE PROPELLER.

defined at a distance of 20 feet. As exten ions of thi kind mean a larger and longer building
for the wind tunnel there would certainly be no advantage in using them .
EFFECT OF HONEYCOMBS.

A honeycomb wa constructed as ·sho,,·n in Fig. 11 and was pJaced at the entrance to
the strnight portion of the tunnel. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining thin-wa,lled metal tubing
and to the expense of con Lrueting honeycombs of this type, only this one was tried. It is

EFFECT OF DIFFUSERS.

The first diffuser tried is sho,,-ninFig.14 and con i t. essentially of a cubical box of which boLh

box was connected rigidly to the rear of the exit cone so that all the air passing through the propeller mu. t eRcape through these small holes. It was hoped in this way to break up any pulsation which 'would originate from the propeller. This aJTangement decreased the speed of the
tunnel by 7 per cent and the maximum variation of speed was
±6 per cent and the direction variation was ±5°, so that it

has '-cry littlo effect on the efficiency of the tunnel, at the same time it docs not much improve the
steadiness of flow. A third difl'user wa constructed as shown in Fig. 16 and placed in the same
po ition as the last. This c1iffu er decreased the airspeed for the same po,yer about 5 per cent, the
variation in velocity was ± 5 per cent, and the variation in direction was ± 4°, howing only a slight

improvoment over the open room. It seoms strange that these diffusers did not improve the
air flow more, as the British have found that difrusers greatly improve the flow in their tunnels.
The results of the e tests would not, however, justify the use of a difl'user in a full-sized tunnel
because of the rather large expen e of const~'uction of such a piece of apparatus.
EFFECT OF PERFORATING THE STRAIGHT PORTION OF THE TUNNEL.

In order to determine the effect on ail' flow of opening the doors in the cylindrical portion of
the tunnel and in u ing mall hoI os for the introduction of apparatus, various tests were made
on the model in order to ee how thi~ would eaect the efficien y and teadines of flow. Also
the volocity of the air in the experimental chamber w'as determined by a small anemometer.
A slot wa fir t cut in tho cylinder parallel to its axis and one-fifteenth of the diameter wide,
running the whole length of tho experimrntal chamber. The air flow extended out about
the width of the lot from the walls of the cylinder, and beyond this there was no flow in the
chamber and the efficiency of the tunnel wa not appreciably all'ected. This slot wa then
increa ed in 'w idth to one- i..'\:th of the diameter of the tunnel , thu decreasing the efficiency
of the tunnel very lightly, and the flow of air extended about one- ixth of the tunnel diameter
into the experimental chamber neare t the exit cone, but thi air flo,," wa Ie marked as the distance to the entrance cone was decrea ed. When the width of the lot was increased to threeeighths of the tunnel diameter the efficiency was decreased about 15 per cent and the air flow
extended two-thirds of the width of the slot into the experimental chamber, near the exit cone,
but there was no Ilow elsewhere in the experimental chamber.
TESTS IN FULL-SIZED TUNNEL.

A few tests were made in the large tunnel in order to afford a comparison with the model.
In Fig. 17 is shown the slip in the large tunnel. In comparing this with a similar condition in
the model tunnel (Fig. 4) it is se:m that for the S :1.ffi air poerl the revolutions per minute is

As the exact efficiency of the driving motor in the large tunnel is unknown, a curve of
horsepower supplied to the motor is plotted again t air speed, but to give some idea of the
power supplied to the propeller a clotted curve is drawn from the estimated motor efficiency.
(Fig. 1 .)
.
"
In comparing thi curve with the one obtained in the model, it i seen that the full-sized
t llunel is slightly more efficient, so tha,t results may be taken from models to safely predict the
performance of the fun-sized tunnels. It is also interesting to notice that the power does not
increase as rapidly as the cube of the speed but more nearly as T1z.s, although, as the efficiency
of the motor is not exactly known, the value of the exponent can not be determined very closely.
Records 'were taken in the full- ized tunnel of variations in velocity, and these are reproducNl in Figs. 19 and 20. In the first figure the wind-tunnel motor was connected to a gasolinedri,en generator of 25 kilowatts and records taken at several speeds. In Fig. 20 the motor was
connected to a 300-kilowatt generator driven by a Liberty motor. The most important characteristic of these records is that the magnitudes of the fluctuations do not increa e as rapidly
as the air speed, so that at the higher speeds, quite contrary to expectation the velocity is
relatively steadier. The maximum variation in air speed at 90 miles per hour was about ± l.5
per cent, where a in the model it was about ± 2 per cent, so that it would seem that the.steadine "tas about the same in any size of tunnel.
Yawmeter records '."ere al 0 taken in the large tunnel, but were not reproduced, as they
how practically a traight line, indicating that the honeycomb was saLi factorily straightening
out the flow.
ATURAL PERIODS OF TUNNEL.

A wind tunnel acts as an open organ pipe aud its natural period will be given by:

where 7 i the length of the tunnel in feet ,
am1. r i the velocity of sound, or 1,040 ft. /sec.
The model tunnel would then have a period of 0.03 seconds and the large tunnel a period
of 0.15 second. Vibration of this nature are ",ery evident audibly in the tunnels at certain
speeds, but do not seem to be present on thr re(·ords, a the piLot Lube is very nearly at the node
of the yibralion. The honeycomb has a considerable iniluenc in damping these vibration,
which are more of a cmiosity than of auy practical interest.
AUTOMATIC REGULATORS.

As it is nol practical to supply a con tant voltage to a wind tunnel, although some tests
}Ulye heen made with storage hattrries where an extremely constant speed was required, it is
rither neces ary to keep the voltage constant ns nearly as possible hy hand regulations or use
ome type of automatic regulator. In small tunnels it is quite easy to regulate the wind by
hand, but in larger tunnel the inertia of the moving parts is so great that there is considerable
amount of lag between the change in regulation and the response of the air speed, making
hanu regulation very difficul t. A very complicated regulator has been constructed at Gottingen
(~. ~\.. C. A. File No. 5346-10) and seems to hold the velocity quite constant. There are
al' o numerous electrical device for maintaining a constant motor speed, and some of these
rrgulator will hold the speed within 0.1 per cent. It seems probable, however, that even if
the revolution per minute of the propeller is con tant that there will still be fluctuations in
the air peed, 0 that a succes ful regulator must be actuated by the air :flow. There is a great
deal of work to be done on uch regulators, and the N. A. C. A. intends to carryon work of
this kind in the near futur .

CONCLUSIONS.

The qualities that should be aimed at in wind-tunnel design in order of their importance
are:
1. Constant direction of flow.
2. Constant velocity of flow.
3. niform velocity across section.
4. Efficiency.
5. Ease of working around tunnels.
6. Simplicity and cheapness of construction.
A good many of these qualities are contradictory, and the best compromise must be !Dade
between them and the type of work that is to be undertaken. For example, a tunnel for te ting
instrument should have a high efficiency, but need not have a very steady flow. On the other
hand, a tunnel for testing wing should have its efficiency omewhat lowered in order to obtain
a steady flow. It is quite possible to so arrange the honeycomb and diffusers that they may
be removed when it is de ired to obtain the highest peed. I t would also be of value to make
it pos ible to open the ends of the building, a there are many days when the wind would have
little effect on the teadine ,and the efficiency would apparently thus be considerably increased.
Thi arrangement would al 0 make it po sible to cool off the air in ~he building in a very short
time, an advantage that would be greatly appreciated in hot weather.
This work eems to show conclusively that a straight exit cone is more efficient than a
curved one, and it i certainly cheapel' to construct. Diffusers affect the air flow very little,
and they do not seem to warrant the expense of construction. Honeycombs, however, are of
the greatest value and should be plac'e d in every tunnel.
