RIkXJM~.

The investigation described in -this report was’ conducted at the Bureau of Standards for
the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,
The spark discharge used. to fire an internal combustion engine””
must pass through the
compressed and heated mixture which occupies the engine cylindir near tie” “end of the compression stroke. The object of the experiments described in this report was to determine
how the voltage necessary to produce such a spark discharge varies with the pressure and
temperature of the gas. The results are of value in showing what voltage an ignition system
is required to deliver in order to produce a spark and in enabling one to set up in the laboratory
a convenient experiments [ gap electrically “equivalent to that in the engine cylinder.
Measurements were made”on”spark plugs scriyred into. a bomb containing compressed ah,
and inserted in. an electric furnace so that both pressure and temperature could be varied m
desired. The sparking voltages were measured on fow plugs, having different electrodes, at
pressuies up to 100 pounds per square inch and temperatures up to 500° C. Both 60-cycle
alternating current and current obtained from a magneto were used. The observed Voltagm
are plotted again:! yressure in plots 2, 3, 4, and 7, and against density in plot 5.
The results show that the sparking voltage isa linear function of the density of the gag and
depends upon pressge and temperature only as they affect the detiity, i. e.,”hiating a gas at
ccmstant volume ddes not ,affect the sparking voltage. For q typical spark plug gap set at
0.5 mm. (0.020=imch)__theparking voltage was found to be 2,800 volts at atmospheric density
s
and 9,4oo volts at a density five times as great,
The data given in this report were obtained on air only, The Ies~lts.of measu;emente made
elsewhere indicate that the sparking voltage in.an explosive mixture of gasoline and air is about
10 per cent loss than in.pure air, and that the change in voltage is proportional to the amount
of gasoline present.

INTRODUCTION.

This report describes some experiments made to determin~ the change of spark potential
with pressure and temperature, in order to determine the necessary minimum potential for
causing sparks to pass in a gasoline engine whose compression ratio was known and in which
the temperature of the gases before ignition could be estimated.
.
According to the simple theory (J. J. Thomson, Conduction of Electricity through Gases;
Townsend, Electricity in Gases; and Peek, Transactions of the herican Institute of Electrical
Enginegrs, 1910–1916) the sparking potential depends solely on the density of the gas between
the ele~rodes for a given fixed pair of electrodes, i, e,, on the total number of molecules between
the electrodes, This has been investigated over a considerable range of pressures, spark distances, and forms of electrodes by numerous observers, but only three investigators have
studied the effect of temperature, and themonly over a limited range. They all found tlia$ the
sparking potential depended soleiy on the density of the gas over the range studied.
In the study of airplane spark plugs it seemed advisable to determine whether this law held
fo~ pr~ures and temperatures which might occur in the cylinders of a high compression engine

pressures undel normal conditions range from 90 to 130 pounds per squaro inch with tcmpmnt.urm
up to 300’c.
APPARATUS. ““”-””

The experiments were conductad .a.sfollows: b.. or&nary &inch Titan A. C. porcelain
plug was screwed i~to a steel bomb about 25 cm. (10 inches) long, having the dmign
indicated in figure 1. T~lerewas a thick gk+.ss
window opposite the sparking tcrrnintilswhen
the plug was screwed in position. A high-pressure air tank cmmected to the bomb through
suitable valves served to regulate the air pressure to any d@red value. Tmnpmatu~es wero
measured by a Pt, ??t-Rh thmmocoupie, 13,S. W5, which was inserted in n steel tul.wscaled at
one end with walls ~ mm. (0.020 inch) thick. This was screwed into the bomb so that its
inner end was within 1 cm. of the sparking termina~sof the plug. The bomb wns placed in
a cylindrical electric resistance furnace and packed with asbestos woo~, so that only the porceh in
insulato~was exposed at one end, while the window projected out tibout 5 cm. (2 inches) beyond
the other end.
Sixty-cycle voltage was supplied through a step-up transformer having a ratio of 200:1
and applied between the central electrode and the bomb, A resistance of z20,000 ohms was
put in se] ies with the plug to avoid an excessive-current and conaequcn t burning of the terminals
when tho spark passed. The voltage was read on a voltmeter connected to the low-tension side
of an auxiliary step-down trm.sformet. The passnga of the spark was made cviclent both by
the kick of the voltmeter and by the appearance of the spark in the bomb, Ionization was
provided for by the uso of a half milligram sample of radium in most of the eipcrimcnts, while
in some a .50-mgg. sample, placed j ust below the electric ful nace, was also used, This ionization
served to eliminate the complicatirug effect of spark “ lag” and mado the readings much more
consistent and reliable, No sti iking difference in the readings could be no tired wit~hthe two
diffel ent samples.
The tests weIe run on three Titan plu~: No. 1 had the regukw terminals-of Ni-bfn wire
1.3 mm. (0.05] inch) in diameter set at. right angles.qnd separ~ted by 1$ mm. (0.071 ..@h);
No. 2 was a Titan plug with simiIar terminals 3.13 mm. (0.123 inch) in diameter rounded at the
ends, separated by 1.2 mm. (0.047 inch); No. 3 was a plug like No. 1 but with a distanco of 2.2
mm. (0.086 inch) betweqn the wires, In each case the spark passed between the cylindrical
surfaces of the wires near the point of closest proximity.
PROCEDURE.

The readings were taken as follows: The. temperature -was run up to the desired valuo
and held constant from 15 minutw to half an hour. There were. fluctuations at the higher
temperatures of as much as 10 degrees eitk.way
so that a mean tempcrat,ure was chosen
as represemti.ng
the hue conditions. The breakdown voltage of the gap was then detmnincd
by at least 10 trials for each pressure. The pressure.. as increased in steps of 10 pounds per
w
square inch. The pressures were re~d by two small pressure grwgcs whose ranges were from
O to 100 pounds per square inch. The spark potentials were read to as high a pressure as it.
\\ras
possible to obtain without the sparks passing over the outside of the insul~tor. Then the
pressure was reduced in steps of 20 pounds and readings again rnnde. As a whole thg return
readings chacked the first readings well. This can be seen from the plots where miwimum
sparking voltage is plotted against the pressure for each temperature. As tho volts@%’hich
could be used without sparking over the outside of the porcelain was about 19,000 volts, !}o
voltages were measured above this. The pressure range over which the memuremcmta could
be carried out starte~ from 60 pounds nt room temperature and increased until at 200° C., or
thereabouts, pressures of 100 pounds could be used.
From then on the pressures-wereIi&ted with increasing temperatures by n l~ewphcrpnrnon
which may have been caused by electron emission from the hot terminals at high i-oltagr.
Under these conditions the spark was replaced by a sort of purple brush dischmge ($gona]

VOLTAGE.

It was at first thought that this glow discharge might be an important factor in causing
ignition trouble, Further measurements were therefore made in the. same apparatus but
with a B“osch D–6 magneto as a source of voltage. With this arrangement no ~rush discharge
could be detected although the observations were carried to 760° C: Above f300° C. the electrical conductivity of the porcelain insulator was great enough to prevent the magneto from
sparking at the higher pressures, but there was no sign of brush discharge under any conditions,
It is probable that a certain time is required for such a discharge to form and that the very
sudden application of voltage produced. by the magneto does not admit of this.

RESULTS.

The curves plotted between maximum sparking potentials in kilovolts and pressure in”
atmospheres may be seen in plots 2, 3, and 4. The results represented by all these curves,
except the one for low temperature measurement with the larger terminals could be repeated
consistently, It is possible that a stronger source of ionization should have been provided,
and the voltage increased still more s@wly in this case. The slight curvatures ~f the li.n~ may
be due in part to the gauges, since no calibration corrections were applied. The direction of the
.curvature is the same as that noted by other observers.
The data given in the curves were analyzed by first reading from each of the curves the
pressure corresponding to a given voltage, say 10,000 volts. Fiom this pressure “and the tern- .
perature pertaining to the curve, the relative density of the gas is thin computed by the formula:

..

where & is the density at I atmosphere ~d 2730 absolute} P is the pressure in atmospheres,
‘
and T the absolute temperature in degrees centigrade. This was done for six diflerent voltand 8,000 volts, and is
ages on each plug. Table I gives the results on plug No. 1 at 10,OOO
“”
typical of the other data. It is evident that the densities thus obtained are constant within
a few per cent. over the enttie range and show no systematic change with- temperature- or “pressures.

Itiliity therefore be concluded that the breakdown voltage is a function of the gas density
only:” To determine the form of this function the average values of density obtained as
described above are plotted against the corresponding voltage in plot .5. The curves thus
show that the breakdown voltage is a linear function of the density but is not proobtai
portion to it. The data can be represented by the follotig
equations:
3.
E=2.2+3.1 P
Plug No. 1
E=l.8+4.O P
Plug No, 2
E=2.4+3.4 P
Plug No. 3
Where E is the sparking voltage in kilovolts and P is the density relative to air at atmospheric pressure and 0° C. The constants in these equations are of course dependent upon the
shape an~ spacing of the electrodes, and would be si.na”ileror the case of the shorter 0.5mm
f
(0.020i~~ch) gaps used in spark plugs.

In addition to the memurements with alternating current d~cribed gmrg, a scco.ndscrigs
of tests was made, using a Bosch II-6 magneto U the soticti of e, m. f. and a spccid crwt voltmeter equipmgnt? .to measure the breakdown voltage.
This equifiment consisted of an Albrecht-electrostatic voltmetm cmmwtcd in series with
a G. E. kenotron (ielect~ valve) as shown in fig~g 6. T~ v~ve. pcrmi h current to flow
ic
when the heated fi.IamentF is negative with respect to the relatively cold anode A ~but allows
no current to flow in the reverse direction, Conseqiently, a negativo charge accundatcs on
the insulated conduc”tm, formed by,the anode and the case of the electromet.w, of such amount
that when the sparking electrode and voltmeter neecl~eare at- their greatest positive potcntial
the filament and anode are at thg samg potential and_th~e & no tendency for furt.hw charging,
During the io.it of the ~ime the needle of the voltmeter is near ground potential, but the rectifying effect of the kenotron prevents the charge from leaking off. Consequently the meter comes
to a steady deflection which measures the maximurg positive voltage applied.
Runs were made with this apparatus at temperature of 460° C. and 5’20° C. up to prcssuros of 150 pounds per square inch, using a Champion (Toledo) plug No. 4 with X-bend CICCtrodes set with the usual spacing of 0.5 mm. (0.020 tich). The results as ob.t~incd arc plot-ted
in plofi--7 and the combined data from these curves are plotted against- rclntivc dcmity in
plot 5, giving a line whose equation is
E=l.l+
1.7p.

“r

These measurements with the magneto and crest voltmeter showed the pI cmnce of a further complication due to the fact that the heat of the spark raised the temperature of tho elcctlodes very materially. This in turn heated the gw _gear them so thafi the discharge occurred
through gas -which was decidedly lass dense than the surrounding at.mosphc~
~. This was
indicated by the fact that at fiat starting the maa~eto the voltme k showed a rchi ti-rely high
voltage (in one case 4,100 volts), which decreased graduaUy for nearly a minute, after which
it remained constant at a much lower value (2,350 volts). The time rcquirecl for the chango
implies very strongly that it is a purely thermal effect rather than tiny ionization duo t{) tho
preceding sparks, since the latter effect would be almost-instantaneous. In tho cas~ of a spark
plug in an engine cylinder, the central electrode, being insulated thermally as well as electrically by the core, is much hotter than the incoming charge and comequen tly this effect may
be preeent to some extent.
As a check upon the laboratory data measurements wel o also made in a Hall%cott A-5
inttiko
aviation engine having a Cornplegsion ratio of 4.2:1. Ow&@ to the lnte dosing of t.lm
valve and the advance of the spark, the actual ratio of cylinder volume at intake to that at
ignition was only 3.2:1. If it can be assumed that the charge in the cylinder & at utmosphcric
pressure and temp~ature at the closhqg of the intake valve, then tho rolativqlonsity at ignition wiU be 3.2. Plug No. 4 was run in this engine firing from a Dixie=!’ Sg” magnetu. The
‘crest voltage as measured by the kenotron was found tube 5,95o volti. ‘-3feasurements with a
calibrated spark gap having 1 cm. spheres indicated 4,500 volts. The vo~tigc predicted for
this density from @re 5 is 6,400 volts.
———
=
In comparing these results it must be borne in mind that the crest voltmeter l&s its
charge very slowly, so that it Ieally indicata the highest peak occurring during two or three
minutes preceding the readixg. The parallel spark gap, on the other hand, is adjusted to flm
about half the time and probably givm more nearly the average crest voltago. ItiFa~poms,
therefore, that the results obtained in the laboratory are in substantial agreement }%th those
found on the engine, and that the linear relation between voltage and density mtiy be safely

applied to ignition circuits.
It will be noted thatithe results shown in plot 5 can be represented roughly by a straight
line through the origin, such as is shown dotted, and which indicates a direct proportionalit.y
between the sparking voltage and density. This relation wiIl be found useful in cases where
the voltage is known at some one density and it is desired to ~timate it for anotl.wr den..ity

not too widely differimt. It is unsafe, however, to use this law of direct proportionality to
extrapolate over a long range from the sparking voltage at riormal atmospheric density to that
at a very high density.
CONCLUSIONS.

These experiments confirm the relation that the breakdown voltage of a spark gap depends
only upon the density of the end
varies with pressure and temperature o“nly as they affect
+
the density. This re a Ion 18 found to be valid up to 800° “C. and 8 atmospheres pressure.
Both the pressure and temperature of the charge in a gasoline eng~e increase very greatly
during the. compression stroke, but the sparking voltage can be computed ~om the Iiriear
relations shown in plot 5 without a knowledge of these variabl~ separately, since the density
is determined solely by the original density and the comprewion ratio-. For small changes in
density, as between engines of different compression ratios, the assumption that the voltage is
proportional to the density may be made.
With the sudden discharge from an ignition coil or maagueto a disruptive spark is produced even at temperatures where a 60-cycle voltage would produce a brush discharge.
The voltage required for a spark plug set at 0.5 mm. (0,020 inch) in an aviation engine of
moderate compression is of the order of magnitude of 6,000 volts.
