INTRODUCTION.

This discussion is an immediate continuation of my pretioue
treatment of the subject ublished in the Fmt Annmd Report of
the National Advisory c?)remittee for Aeronautics, Washington,
1915, p es 62-76 (S. Dec. 268, 04th Co ., 1st sess., reference to
be by pages). The”notations Y that work will be cono

PERIODIC

G
That there is a certain degree of periodicity in
b is obvious
from casual obsavation, from the records of scient- c observatories
F
like Blue Hill, and from the familiar fact thab d such henomtma
in nature reveal a general tendency toward periodicity. E eto
sa the periodicity is not mathematically exact in its regularity nor
in K
etite in continuance.
The object, however, of en invwtigation of the efkt of periodic
gusts on an airpkme can for practical purposes be no other than
to reveaI any exceptiomd effects that periodic, as compared with
single, gusts may have u n the flight of the machine; gnd tke
exceptional tiects will pror ab~y be indicated with sufficient practical
completencs by sn analysie built on the assumption of strict periodiclt long continued in operation-the phenomenon most to be

not essy to see Pow vertical gusts can have any renounced periodicity; the disturbance of the airplane’s motion Ey vertical gusts
is (p. 64), except for very sharp gusts, essentially a convection of
the machine with and by the gust; for both these reasons 2° maybe
discarded. This leav= only l“—periodkity in the head-on guetin~—ss likely to be of interest.

In the previous investigation it was found that the short-period
heavily damped osci~ation vw not of much significance except in
the case of a sharp upt (pp. 62-69), and that lta significance in
that case was not revo LfY in the major motion of the machine but
ed
in the initial acceleration (or stress) upon it. It may therefore bo
e ectid that for periodic head-on gusts the short-period motion
wi be negligible in its eff~cts. It is consequently dcwrabIe to carry

The calculation gives gP=O.0394 or =0.1985. The value of the
ampIitude is then about 0.0095J ra&‘ans or 0.54J degre~. If J
should be 20 ft./see., the forced oscillation would have an amplitude
of about 10°.
As the use of p =0.1985 in calculating ie somewhat more complicated than the use of =0.2, aud as the
e from 0.1985 to 0.2
does not materially J ter the amplitude 9of t e forced oscillation
(and probably doea not exceed the error of observations), we may
use p = 0.2 in Cskndating tie effect of 8

take p= 0.59S or p= O.774. The vah.e of w/J is theu
ID/J= —0.136e~@,
and the amplitude of w is 0.136J. The ampIitude of the oscillation
corresponding to filmparticular solution 1. is 0.175J.
Thus again it is seeu that the steering device makes the motion
far easier than *en the machine is free (p. 70). There seems to
be no need of carrying out the details of the integration.
NOTEON RESONANCE.
In deflnin by implication a state of resonsmce in & calculaabove, Y have a-sumed &at it was the angle 8 which was to be
c
ma. umzed by the proper choice of the frequency p of the appIied
x
periodic force. It maybe welI to take up the theory of resonance in
a little greater detail, for there are complications in the kind of
system we have here to consider.
A. G. Websterl in his “D
amica of Particles, etc. “ Teubner,
19o4, page 175, grws generaI rormulas for resonance and shows that
if the dam ing codicienta are snudl and if the frequency of the
impressed ?’
orce nearly ooincides with that of the naturaI oscillation,
theh~p~tuu
ofotie forced vibration will be relatively large.
. For in the first place the dampimg coeilicients in the case T the aerophme can hard be reganled se small
o
(they sometimes exceed &e frequencies); in J e second lace, we are
.
not eva certarn that the motion of the system is who If’ oscillatory
y
(some of the mote ma be real and even positive if the machine has
a certain mount of $ ynarmc instability); and in the third place,
-~
under such conditions, the am Iitude of tie forced oscillation may
be considerably greater when” L frequency of the ap Jied foroe n
materially different fmm that of the system (supposei oscilhhtory)
than when the system and the force are nearly synchronous.

the same. This may be re rded as va~dating our procedure
(sec. 6) in maximizing 6 insteaT ofJWt.
To sum up this discussion of resonance as applied to the a&oplane
we may say that the frequencies which produce ‘<resonanw J‘ depend
largely upon the usntity in which the efkct of resommce is to be
sought and that & e frequency which make9 for a strong resonant
effect in one quantity may make on another sn eflbct much weaker
than the maranmm-or it may not.
There remains to discuss the question whether the ef7ect of resonance is practically serious, i. e., whether as in the case of the motion
of the mwihine, above treated, the effect faik to make it.df felt
until after so long a time that the pilot would be entirely able to
deal with it or the wind would really have in all probability ceased
to be periodic with the period required..
Now in order to insure that resonance is etlective both of itself
and as against the natural motion, we should reasonab~ oxpcct to
require, lot that the resonant frequency p be large (for J it be s~ll
the pilot will have am le time to take care of it), and that, 2°, itibe
reasonabl dMerent ! rom uny natural frequency which is onl
sIightly J amped (for in the latter case the rnitial conditions A “

This probbm in ita generality is so complicated that I have as yet
been unable to determine whether there ma be racticalIy serious
effects due to resonan~, but from the CS.SW i~ave ere treated, from

the
neral considerat~ons which I have advanced, with duo re rd

foreseeing the worst that co~d happen, to discuss
%
I have not time to take the matter up here. Moreover, ~ imagine
that it would be found that the constants of integration turned out
to have such values that b gust, though tuned m damping and in
frequency to the natural motion of the machine, did not have very
large effects except in cases where n and p were smaII enough to
aIIow the piIot easily to correct for the disturbance.
The damped pemodic gust has been treated by Brodetaky ’ who
fids the amplitude of the articular solution is a maximum ({or the
machine J.am dedin.g wi t%) when t= 16 see. and is then a tolerably
large quantity, —but the pilot has a quarter of a minute in which to
react to his environment. It is, however, b no means certain that
the pflot would have to react so quickly-t ~ e constants of integration might turn out, as I have just suggested, such that the motion
during the 13rstquarter minute was not far difkent from that in
the case of the simple gust. This w= what was found to hap en in

The calculation of the constanta of integration is much simplified.
The terms t+ r are retained because the stresses (forces) due to the
gust are caku i ated from du/dt and &u/dt ta which these terms make
an initial contribution-there
is an instantamwus initial stress.

dw/dt= (.557 -.446 –.106 + .007 +.006)JE .018J.
These are the initial accelerations and should vanish because the
gust thou h infinitely sharp begins at zero. That they do not
vanish is f ue to an accumulation of errors.
Immediatdy after the initial instant, however, the fit tams,
viz., .128 and .557, being multiplied by@
vanish. “The other terms,
however, bein muhiphed by comparatively slow changing functions
are not altere%, Hence immediately after the fist instant there are
accelerations – .128J and – .557J along the x and z axes, respectively.
To ut it another way, there is a discmtinuity in the stress at the
initi al!’instant-as might be expected. The amounts of the disccmtinuities are also just what might be expected, vizl X,J and ZtiJ.
In Eke manner for an u -gust the initial discontimuties in acceleration are XWJ and ZUJ 3 o
the z and z axes. Thesa reswltacouId

THE ACTfONOF THE AIR SCREW.
In the work to this point, I have made for the discussion of gusts
the same assumption concerning the action of the propeller thah
Ihmsaker Bairstow, and others have made for discussions of stabiLity,
namely, t~at under varying conditions the motor speeds up or slows
down so as to deliver a constant thrust along the z-axis.
It would be equally reasonable, from some oints of view more
reasonable, to assume that under changing con c!“tions of relative air
vakwity a motor speeds up or SIOWS
down so as to deliver the same

due to tie change in orientation $– the macL e moves away from

culate a periodic gust we found that we were involved in powers and
products and uotiente of complex numbers, and it is probable that
the work we 3 d in tiding the particukw integrals was comparable
with that required for the present analysis.
SUMMARY.
In continuation of my previous work in gusts as afbcting the
tiactor JN2, I have discussed:
1. Periodic ?mgitudinal guds.-lt wee found that, even in the
csse of best resonance with the slow natural oscillation, the motion
was not much tierent from that produced by a simple head-on
t until after a considerable time (over 14 seconds) had elapsed.
& e am Etude of the forced oscillation (in u and down motion)
which J timately became effective was about Rve times the amplitude of the gust. This was not regarded as serious because true
periodicit can rareI be maintained in a head gust and because no
pilot wo J d wait to ret its collectreach such a magnitude. Periodic
up gueta and rotary gusts were wnsidered as not lddy to arise.
2. @neral t?wory of resonance.-It was shown that for aero lane
roblems rescmance meant diilerent things for different robT
ems.
f t wss inferred that resonanca wss unli.kel to be particularf’y serious
because in all probability ite effect woul z either be small or would
take so long to become e.stabIishedthat the pilot would check it.
3. In ndiiy sits
ts.—It was seen that the shock to a machine

The serious csse is mZW ~the vertical shock in an up gust

w% “ch was about 4J/g times the wdght, more than twica that found
for the sharpest gust reviously treated. It would be still more
serious in a machme wL e Z. wss greater than in the JN2. The
moral: Kee Zq small, clashes with Hunsaker’s conclusion 1 that
lateral stab&‘ty ISincom atible with high wing loading-but such an
antithesis is Common.S % eference was made to im ulsive gusts.
4. Ziie @ect of the propeh.-ll!he
sssmnption L t a comtant
power instead of a constant thrust was delivered did not very mab
rially alter conditions of tight.
6. La.i!malg@.-!l%e
general equations were setup and integra@d.
(a) Single side gusts were shown to reduce modern side shppmg,
insignificant rolI, and moderate yaw. ! t was seen that the yaw was
into the relative wind so that the displacement of the machine in
space was toward the gust despita the side slipping.

(b) Oscillatory side guets were shown to be a common condition
of flight, to produce moderate side slippbg and yawing, but insigficsnt

promptly by the pilot.
6. Constrained mac?iinV.-A device to keep the aero lane on ita
made the previousl unstaEle machine
course or to prevent ro

stable. Such a device mig t be important to lx%we the liability to
the spiral dive in rolling gusts provided such gusts were common
phenomena in flying weather.
7. Other methods o trealment.-~e
Bryar&ordets&
metiod of
initial motions and J romwich’s new method of ftnding the solution
for a disturbed state without calculating the constants of integration
were briefly compsred with my s~tem of snslysis.
