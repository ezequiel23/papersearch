medioal tests

of 9000 m.) and he hae

continued those tests of late years In an airship,

in an

airplane, under a parachute and finaily in a pneumatlodiamber.

There is an advantage in the tests made in the pneu-

matZo ohamber through the abeenoe of moral exoitement, whioh
is unavoidable under any other oondi,tons; and alterations
i
can also be easily made in the test conditions.

The most importantpoints gained from the tests, with
regard to mental effort d~ing a more or less prolonged

ae follows:

the airships of the German Navy.

“ The rapidity with whioh Dr. KOSCREL effeoted the transition from one altitude zone to another is most remarkable.
