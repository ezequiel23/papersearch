BOMB TRAJECTORIES
By EDTVIN BIDWELL WIISON.

L INTRODUCI’ORY.

The trajectory

of a bomb of high tcmnimd velocity dropped from a great altitude such as
a complicated analysis much like that for the trajectory of a shell tied at a
high angle. For, in the tit place, the changing density of the air can not be whoIly ignored,
and in the second place, the air resistance as a function of the velocity is exceedingly complicated,
and, in particuhm, as the bomb may pass through the vebcity of sound in air, all sorte of complications leading even ta instability and tumbling, which render any calculation of the trajectory
illusory, may be present.
I have pointed out in a previous note on the Limiting Velocity of Free Fall that bombs of
Mgh terminal velocity must fall over 10,000 feet and acquire a velocity of 800 ft./see,, that
bombs of lower terminal velocity must fdl though even greater distances, and that there is
tolerable agreement among b@ticians
that Up to velocities of about 800 ft./see., the simple
square law of reaistanca (R a @) holds for solid shelMke bodies.
The problem which I wish
b treat here is that of the trajectory of a bomb launched horizontally when the fall is not so
“ great that the velocity exceeds” 800 ft./see., at any point of the path.
Ordy the fit approximation founded on the assumption of constmt air density wdl be developed.

IL GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

This problem has been treated in several ways iU an elementary manner, e. g., by E. L
C+ayhart in “Aviation,” Volume III, No. 12, January 15, 1918, pages 819-822, after the German,
.My discussion, likewiee elementary, is that which I ha~e given students
by Ernest Hemkel.

htitute
of Technology, and which may be
of intersst to others.
If Vbe the velocity in path, u, v the componmt velocities horizontal and vertical downward,
respectively, U the terminalvelocity, the resistmce is 1?= k P = t7V2/ U2pounds, where Wis the

and compared with the equation for vertic~ f~ in which V= v. For the trajectory

Now bombs are rolmse(l with a horizontal “velocity VO= UOwhkh is small rclativo t.o tlmir

vertical drop is not so large as to generato a vertical vehcity in excess of 8.00 ft./see in the caso
of free fall. Thie brings the safety limit for the application of the squaro law for rcsistu nce

when 2y/z is not large, i. e., when y is not more than a few hundred feet. In fact, a comparison
shows that the fourth term in (7) is equal to the second term, which is identical with tlm correction in (5), when gz/uOa= 4.5. In the case of a machine for which u, = 100, z = 1,400. If (7)

when s is larger the rehtti~e approach to z-l-y is ftiirly good. 3foreapproach of 8 to z is dose;
