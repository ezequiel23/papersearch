and convenient forl:. the salient facts of this report for
the benefit of those ',/ho may ',- ish to utilize the results
;
of this jLvestiga-i:iion without studying the more detailed
description of apparatus and methods.

that the

cracking at sharp bends, observed in -Ghe insulat ion of high
tension ignition .vires after service, is due to a cher::ical

•

•

attack upon the rubber by the ozone produced by the electric
discharge ":;hich takes place at the surface of the cable .
This cracking does not occur if the insulating material is
not under tension, or if the cable is surrounded by some
medimn other than air; but does occur even if the

insul~tion

is not subjected to electric stress, provided the atmosphere
near the cable containc ozone .

The extent of this cracking

varies greatly with the insulating material used; and can be materially reduced by using braided cable and by avoiding

CAUSES OF CRl\.CKING OF IGNITION CABLE.

High tension ignition cables, used to connect the
spark plugs with the distrioutor blocks on internal combustion engines, occasionally give trouble by cracking of
the insulation; which is
sharp bends in the cable.

particula~ly

likely to occur at

It has been found by manufac-

turers of ignition systems that a convenient test of the

•

ability of a cable to give satisfactory service is obtained by '.VTapping the cable firmly around a metal mandrel and
applying VOltage f_offi a magneto or spark coil between the
core of the

c~

Ie and the

~andrel .

Inferior quality cable

will in the course of a few hours show cracks which begin
at the outer surface and

ra?id~y

become deeper

~~til

a

puncture of the insulation finally occurs through one of
these cracks .
The Bureau of Standards

I~S

request3d oy the Bureau

of Aircraft Production to locate more

defi~itely

the cause

of this trouble, and for this purpose an extensive series
of tests was made on three samples of ignition cable.

Sam-

ples I and II were very kindly supplied for the test, by
the Kerite Insulated Wire and Caole Company and ITere insulated with their Kerite compaQlld.

The results of this test are given in Table II

In this table, column II or III, gives the length of

•

time that the sample was subjected to the ele ctrical stress

firing a 6 mm. 3-point spark gap; or from a transformer,
giving the voltage indicated in column IV at 60 cycles.
Column V gives the medium surrounding the cable, and column VI the diameter of the arbor on which it was wrapped.
Column VII states by "yes ll or Hnoll "lVnethe r or not failure

the average of results obtained upon the number of breakdown samples indicated in column XI.

This table contains

only data on failures w

of the samples.

All cases where there was any possibility

of failure being produced by undue mechanical or electrical stress at the ends of the sample or at the surface of

the

v~ter

have been omitted.

It appears from this work that cracking is produced
in substantially the same manner, but

so~e what

more rap-

idly; when the samples are testeu on 10000 volts alternating current, than when tested on a magneto.

The amount

bf the cracking is very materially reduced by the pres-

ence of the braid and is much less in the material having
Kerite insulator than in that with the rubber.

The

cracking is entirely absent if the sample is left straight,
or if no electrical stress is applied, or if surrounded
by water or paraffin.

The cracking is evidently a pro-

gressive phenomenon, requiring a combination of several
factors, i.e . , mechanical stress, eleotrification, and the
presence of air.
The the ory of this action, w
hich successfully eXplains
nearly all of the phenomena,

~as

originally suggested by

- 5 -

Mr. Harris of the Kerite Company as follows:

The electri-

fication produces a brush discharge at the surface of the
cable, whicn. in turn produces ozone and. oxid.es of nitrcgen .

This is

sho~n

by the noticeable odor after the endur-

ance test has been run for some time and the
surrounding the vYires '[men in the dark.

vis~ble

glow

This glow is more

prominent on the A. C. test and Figs . 1 and 2 are photographs of this taken with about 15 minutes' exposure at
13 000 volts.

The electrical stress in the air at the

surface of the cable, as computed from the d.imensions of
the wire and the dielectric constant, comes out much in
excess of the breakdovm strength of air and indicated that
corona is to be expected .
It is well known that ozone actively attacks rubber;
and when the rubber is under mechanical stress the products ' of the reaction are pulled apart , thus exposing at
each incipient crack a fresh surface of rubber, Which is
in turn attacked .

This effect doubtless is responsible

tor the fact that the action is localized in definite
cracks when the material is under tension but does not
penetrate the material when the rubber is unstressed .
That the presence of air is required. is shown by the
fact that no cracking occurred in any of the samples tested under water or when coated with paraffin.

A series of

tests were made to demonstrate the effect of the ozone
by inserting samples of the cable in the bottom of a glass

jar which 'lIas provided at -Ghe top with a pair of elec-- --trodes from -,vhich a high vOltage brush discharge could be
produced.

The jar was sealed tightly and a discharge

from the points maintained a copious supply of ozone.

The

results obtained with this apparatus are as follows:

Kerite Tape:

No tension; no effect notioeable.

Kerite Tape:

100% elongation; deep cracks on exposed side, particUlarly near edges.
Sample broke at grips .

and curled slightly.

50% elongation; ~~apped on cable;
cracked badly and fell apart .

Okonite Tape:

No tension; no effect.

Three types of ignition cable laid straight in bottom of jar;

One sample of each cable wrapped on 3/8 11 diameter arbor.
Kerite braided:

No cracks except at ends.

Kerite bare:

Badly cracked and rubber entire l y

The maximu.'1l vol t-

age applied to the specimen in these tests probably did not
exceed 18 000 volts, which is a

relatively small fraction

of the breakdown strength of the unaffected cable, and
these results imply a progressive deterioration of the mat-

The time required to ?roduce

these effects is long compared wi th that in wh ich cracking

It was at first thought that the simultaneous application of mechanical and electrical stress might be the
cause of the failures; but this is n ot

t~e

case, as shown

by Table IV, which was obtained on lerite insulation in
the form of strips, and which shows no change great enough
to account for the failure of the specimen at the lo w
