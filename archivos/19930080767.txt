The object of the instruction in aviation schools should not
be to produce aviators, as
-

such, but efficient constructors and

thinkers.- F’lyingcan -be quickly-learned at..any time, eithez in
connection with t-ne sct*oolor related ir.dustri,es.
The whole course of instruction may be conveniently divided
into several courses, semesters or years, according to the aims
of the institution.

If practical av”iation is to be taught in ths

institution, i% would be better to leave it till near the end of
the entire course.
The subject should be made attractive to the student, homever,
even during the first year.

It is a good plan to take up the his-

torical material, which will furnish entertai.nm.ent
for many a lesso::
and thus forr~an agreeable diversion fxom the dry and difficult
material of the elemeiltary subjects.
I have been very successful on these lines in the Nuremberg

For more ath~anced stu.de:lts

certain courses (for instance, in mathematics) could be replaced
by courses in manual training.
In Nuremberg, the course is divided into four years of eight
months, witb~ 12 to 15 work hours pel- wee?.. By increasing the b.mufis
per

week, the whole course might be divided into several semester~

or quarters with a minimum of not less than three semesters.
