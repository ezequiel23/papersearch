R ES UM ~.

The Bureau of Standards carburetor test plant has been de igned for convenient, speedy ,
and accurate observations of carburetor performance, without inclusion of the complications
attendant upon engine performance in 'uch testing. It comprises an orifice air meter, supplying
air to a miniature altitude chamber, in which the carburetor i mounted. Air is drawn through
the carburetor by a vacuum pump, and flow pul ations in the air stream are simulated by an
apparatus controlling both the n'lte and amplitude of the pul ations. Pressure within the
carburetor chamber can be lowered from that of the atmosphere to approximately one-quarter
of an atmosphere ; and the air temperature can be r aised to any desired value above that of the
atmosphere.
Weighing of the fuel and ob ervations of pres me about a carburetor permit of determining the mixture ratios and coefficient of flow under any service conditions.
DESCRI P TION OF CARBURETOR TEST PLANT.

The Bureau of Standards carburetor testing plfil1t was designed and built for the purposo
of insuring greater precision and speed in observations of carburetor metering charaoteristics
than are conveniently possible where the carburetor i in use on an engine. It is de igned to
permit observations not only at atmospheric p re ure and temperature, but also at air pressures a Iowa one-third of an atmo phere, and at such temperatures a may be desired abov
atmospheric temperature. Means are al 0 provided for pr oducing p~sation of the air fiow, comparable in speed and amplitude to tho e met with in practice. Thus it i . po ible to reproduce
substantially any condi tion which may obtain in service on an engine) and at the same time
variables due to the engine condition are eliminated. The cour e of the investigation is so
simplified as to make it possible for one man to control the whole plant and make all observations incident to a set of run. W11ile the resu lts obtained usu ally require checking on an engin
in operation, the final tage is reached more quickly, conveniently, and at far less expense, as
well as more acourately than if all the tests had been made on the engine.
The set-up comprises the follow ing several units:
(1) The air meter.
(2) The throttle valve.
(3) The air heater.
(4) The oarburetor chamber.
(5) The pulsator.
(6) The air pump.
(7) The fuel meter.
( ) The manometer columns.

UAL REPORT NATIO

AL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERO :rAUTICS.

To follow the course of the air through the plant: It first passes the air meter, then flows
through the throttle valve and over the heating grids to the carburetor chamber. Here it
enters the carburetor under observation, aiter which it pa ses through the pulsator to tho
blower pump, from which latter it is discharged to the atmo phere.
The general appearance and arrangemenj; of the plant arc shown in figme 1, in which view
the convenient grouping of the controls is clearly brought out.
A detailed description of the several units of the plant follows:
TilE AIR

IETER.

This portion of the plant :follows exactly the specifications laid down by Dmley 2 in hi work
on air flow through orifices in thin plates, with the one exception that the direction of flow i
reversed with reference to the orifice box or chamber. Since, however, the cro s sectional area
of the chamber in a plane parallel to that of the orifice is somewhat over the limiting value of
20 to 1 referred to the maximum orifice a,rea employed, and since the drop in pres me acros.
the orifice is never permitted to exceed 6 inches of water column, the fact that the air flow i
into instead of out of the chamber is of no consequence in the measurements.
Figure 2 is close-up view of the orifice end of the metering chamber. Here are shown the
approach passage with its grid for the purpose of protecting the lines of flow into the orifice
from disturbance by stray room cmrents, and the truotural details of the orifice mounting.
The orifices are bored in steel plates 0.057 inch thick, with perfectly square edges, and range
in size from 3.500 inch to 0.500 inch, by 0.500 inch decrements. Th re is provided in addition,
an orifiqe of 0.3125 inch diameter, and also a blank plate used for checking the tightne s of the
chamber and throttling valve. The orifice plates seat upon a rectangular ga ket of pme gum
rubber of one-quarter inch thickness, thus insuring air tightness even though the plates are
prung in 10c1..ing them upon the end of the chamber.
The pres me drop across the orifice is read on the upper of the two inclined manometers
shown above the pyramidal approach to the carbmetor chamber, figure 1. This manometer is
provided with a scale having divisions 1 millimeter apart, and is set at such an angle that each
division is equal to a vertical rise of the column of 0.01 inch. This readily permits an accuracy
of observation of plus or minu 0.0025 inch on the deflection of the column. In addition there
is provided a short vertical water column, at the immediate left of the carburetor chamber,
having a scale divided into fiftieths of an inch, and read tru:ough a magnifier, with provisions
for the avoidance of parallax. This latter column is fitted with a tank having one hundred times
the area of the tube, thus its reading are at all times 1 per cent too small. While the inclined
column is also connected with a tank (in thi case a Wolff bottle at the back of the board) the
inclination of the tube is ~o adjusted that no correction need be made.
THE THROTTLE VALVE.

A length of 3-inch pipe connects the orifice chamber with the gate valve hown in the foreground of figure 3. The function of this valve is the control of the pressme within the carburetor chamber, in a study of the performance characteristics of carburetors undor atmo pheric pressures lower than that at the ground. The manipulation of the throttling vah-e will
be di cussed in detail in that section of the de cription devoted to the method of control.
TllE AIR HEATER.

For the purpose of observation of tho effects of varying air temperature on carbmetor
performance the air, after it has passed the throttling valve, is drawn tru'ough a chamber composed of a set of five frames, in each of which i mounted a coil of resi tance wU'e in such a maDner
as to cause it to be reasonably completely swept by the au' stream. A shown in figure 4, the
five units of the heater are wired to controlling s'witches and a rheo tat in such manner that

three of them are upplied with current at 220 volts, without externall'esistance, when their
respective control switche are closed, while the fourth may be thrown into circuit on either
110 or 220 volt as de ired. The fifth unit is in series with a rheostat, and may also be supplied from either the UO-volt or the 220-volt lines, as required.
The capacities of the units are identical and the control is uch as to permit of extremely
delicate regulation from about 3° above the atmo pheric temperature up to 45 ° C. above that
temperature, with the maximum air flow of which the plant is capable. Chamber temperatures
are read on a mercurial thermometer mounted ju t within the gla door, as in figure l.
TIlE OARBURETOR OHAMBER.

Leaving the heater, the air passes through the pyramidal appro:1C'h pa sage to the carburetor
chamber. Mounted in the entrance to the In.tter is a grid similar to that shown in the approach to
the air metering orifice. The increasing sectional area o[ the approach to the carburetor chamber and the grid just mentioned are designed to obyiate to alal'ge extent the eddy currents that
might be expected to exist within the chamber hould the air be introduced in a column of
small section at higher velocities.
The carburetor chamber comprises a box 18 by 1 inches at the ends (outside) and 30 inches
long (outside), built up of yellow-pine boards 2 inchc thick. Inside, at each junction of abutting
walls, the structure is reinforced by a fi ttecllength of 2-inch angle iron. The door opening is
recessed to take a steel frame made UJl of :!i-inch square tock, th outer face of which is flush
with the face of the chamber. OYer the whole is fitted a solder-scaled sheathing of galvanized
iron, and supported by the turned-up edge of the hea thing at the door opening is a rectangular
gum rubber gasket, 7:;1.' inch thick, having a :!i-inch face. The glass door, shown in figure 4
resting on the table beneath the carburetor chamber, is of plate glass, :!i inch thick, and is supported and damped in place over the opening and agains t the gasket by the pair of steel bars
shown at the top and bottom of the opening.
The heavy con truction of the chamber i nece 'itated by the great pre sure to which the
walls are ~ubjected when the pressme within the chamber i reduced, as in studyinG' high-altitude
performance of carburetors. The heathing of galyanized iron is employed to insure air-tightness.
This form of heathing is also applied to the pyramidal approach, and to the orifice chamber.
Within the carburetor chamber, and in the center of its top wan, is rnoll1ted a circular
flange to which the several carburetors studied are secUl'ed with intel'po ed adapters . At the
left of the door opening is a pair of control spindle, with adjustable level in ide the chamber,
for the control of the throttle and wbllLeyer other control member may be proyided in the carburetor.
A sleeve, integral with the 'arhuretor flange within the chamber, extend through the top
wall to form an air-tight joint with a large circular flange secured to the outside of the chamber.
The carburetor outflow passage con"ists of a glass tube held in glands spaced by four
Va-inch studs. Several adyantages re 'ult from making this portion of the outflow pa sage of
glass. The quality of the charge, with re pect to the finenes of divi ion of the liquid, is shown ;
irregularities in the fuel discharge are made obvious; it can be seen whether or not the I assages
of the carburetor cause swirling of the air stream; and localization of the liquid in the stream
or on the wall i~ definitely shown. In addition to the above, observation of the gla sseI've
as a ready check on the functioning of the float mechanism of the carburetor.

pulsating flow through the carburetor, closely following in character tho e fluctuations of pressure and velocity experienced in the operation on an engine. The exterior of the pulsator is

rectangular throttle plate. Secured to the front and the back walis of the rectangular passage
are plates of spring bronze, which are normally flat, and cause no restriction of the passage.
These spring plates form flexible walls for the passage, and permit of varying its effective area
in the plane of the throttle spindle.
A one-sixth horsepower shunt motor, mounted on the Lop of the carburetor chamber, is
arranged to drive the pulsator spindle through three-step pulleys. The control of the speed is
upplemented by field resistance; and a magnetic tachometer is used to show the speed of the
spindle. These latter items are shown in figures 1 and 2, mounted on the front wall of the metering ori.fice approach passage. The tachometer is one built for cam-shaft drive on an engine and
thus reads directly in pulsations per minute, since the pul ator throttle weeps the pa sage twice
for every revolution. The range of control provided permits of a change in rate of pulsations
from 600 to 4,000 per minute. This is equivalent to a range of engine speeds from 300 to 2,100
in the case of four cylindel~, and from 400 to 2,800 r. p. m. in the case of three cylinders per
carburetor.
The amplitude of the pressure pulsations i controlled by manipulation of the screws shown
in figures 4 and 5, to cause the spring plates to approach the edges of the throttle plate more or
less closely as the throttle revolves. Thus it i possible to reproduce sufficiently faithfully for
the purpose in hand, the pulsation characteristic of any engine cylinder combination of more
than one cylinder, having the aspiration stroke evenly spaced.
A simple form of optical indicator is employed to show the magnitude of the pressure
fluctuations in the carburetor discharge passage. This indicator is shown in diagram in figure 6.
No attempt is made to make a pressure-time diagram of the pulsations. The magnitude of the
pressure fluctuations is read from the calibrated screen of the indicator, on which appears a line
of light, the ends of which define the values of the upper and lower pressure limits.
THE AIR

PUMP.

A Nash "Hydro turbino" vacuum pump is used to draw the air through the carburetor.
Its intake is connected with the pul ator outlet by a length of flexible metallic tube, a shown in
the general view, figure 1 i and the pump discharge is carried ou t through a window of the
laboratory.
Between tho pulsator flange and that on tho end of the floxible tube is a throttling opening
and trap. This la ·ter serv s the doublo purpo e of eliminating the effect upon the carburetor
of 1'0 onanco in the l<mgth of flexible tube whon the pulsator is in action, and of trapping and
passing directly to the pump tho liquid that would oth~rwise accumulate above the pulsator with
small air flows. This liquid pas os to the pump intako through a inclined length of %-inch pipe.
The N ash pump is that company's No.3 izo, and is capable of reducing the pressure within
the carburetor chamber to 180 mm. Hg., or to 1 0/760 = 0.237 atmosphere, with the throttling
valve fully closed. Between the limits of the barometor column of 350 mm. and one of 760 rom.
the weight of air pumped is a straight line function of the pressuro. The capacity of the pump
as appliecl to this plant is shown graphically in plot 7, in which the weight of air pumped i
plotted against barometric pres nre and also against pump peed at a chamber pres ure of 740
rom.

tank and the chamber of 2 pounds per square inch. After passing the pre sure regulating valve,
the fuel onters a vapor trapping chamber set upon Lhe tank, and from this point flows through

chamber. From this fitting, the connection with the carburetor is completed through a length
of airplane fuel hose.
The beam of the scale is fitted with a contact arm, which upon falling of the beam dips into
a mercury cup and completes a circuit through a magnetic apparatus controlling the starting and
stopping of a stop watch. Closure of the circuit through the watch control also completes the
circuit through an annunciator, thus drawing the attention of the operator to the fact that a run
has started or ended, as the case may be. This me thod of timing a weighing possesses the
advantages of making the weighing automatic, and eliminating the personal equation in the
operation of the wate-h, and of permitting the operator to devote his attention to the controls
and the making of observations throughout a run.
THE MANOMETER COLUMNS.

A rectangular flange soldered to the carburetor chamber sheathing carries 12 union fittings
to which are secured 12 manometer lines of 34-inch (0. d.) copper tube. The union fittings
extend into the chamber approximately 1% inch beyond the walls, and to them can be con' nected with rubber tubing the several points about a .carburetor at which it is desired to take
pressure observations. The manner in which the manometer lines are carried to the board
supporting the columns is clearly shown in figures 1, 3, and 4 .
One of the manometer lines, the seventh from the left side of the manometer board,is used
to communicate the chamber pressure to barometer located at about the center of the board,
to the left leg of the first mercury U tube and to the tank on the back of the board. This tank
contains water, and forms the well agftinst which t.he set of six water columns, at the left, are
balanced. The water columns are capable of useful deflec tions of 1,020 nun. (40 ins.); and each is
provided with a needle valve shut-of!'. The seventh and middle short water column has its
upper end communicating with the air space of the tank at the back of the board and serves as
an indicator of the zero position. Inspection of figure 4 will show that the scales of the watu
columns are mounted to form a unit capable of vertical movement under control of the screw
passing through the header from which the columns draw their water. Thus it is possible to
reset the scales during a run to correct for the displacement of the zero fonowing the transfer of
water from the tank to the columns. The tank is made of sufficiont area so that with three
columns standing full the error in observation is only 1 per cent, with the scales left in tho zero
position given them before deflection of the columns. Hence, since it is only very rarely that
more than three columns are in simultaneous use, and then at much less than maximum: deflection, the error in observation without resetting of the zero is ordinarily weH within 1 per cent.
In addition to the six water columns di~cussed , and the main barometer for indicating the
chamber pressure, the board includes a pair of mercury U tubes, and a supplementary U-tube
barometer. Both legs of the second U tube are capable of connection "vithin the chamber,' for
making differential readings not referred to the chamber pressure, or for making plus pressure
observations. The au.uliary barometer tube is used where it is desired to make direct observations of absolute pres ure at some point about a carburetor. It is obvious that by· use of T
fittings and tubing within the chamber the columns can be interconnected in any combination
that may be required to fit the case under observation.
METHOD OF OPERATION.

Most of the work that has been done in the carburetor testing plant ha been with special
reference to the requirements of certain aeronautic type engines, and as a consequence the
weights of air to be taken through the carburetor under given surrounding conditions have been
well established beforehand by direct observations on the engines themselves in the Bureau of
Standards' altitude laboratory. This points out one of the chief uses of the plant, in that
special requirements of individual cases, as wen as the desirable range of operability of a carburetor, can be studied in detail and with a maximum of convenience and a minimum of cost and
lost motion.

METERING CHARACTERISTICS OF CARBURETORS.

11

The 25-horsepower motor used to drive the pump is a shunt type, and is provided with
resistances in the field circuit for effecting control of the pump speed. These resistances are
shown on the table sill in figures 1 and 4.
With the pump in operation, the amount of air taken through the carburetor is controlled
by (1) the position of the carburetor throttle, (2) the position of the throttling valve between the
meter chambor and the air heater, and (3) the position of the gate valve on the pump intake,
which faces the driving motor benenth the table and is controlled by the wheel at the table
edge, as in figure 1. This latter valve controls the depression in the carburetor outlet, and in this
way the air taken through the carburetor. The throttling valve, on the other hand, controls
the amount of air pumped; through its influence upon the pressure, and therefore the density,
of the air in the carburetor chamber.
Assume the case where it is desired to take a given weight of air through the carburetor at a
given barometric pressure and with a given pressure drop in the carburetor outlet, corresponding
to a run under partial throttle opening. Having located a suitable orifice in the entrance to the
meter chamber, the pump intake by-pass valve and the throttling valve are adjusted to give the
required deflection of the orifice manometer at the required chamber pressure. This establishes
the air flow referred to the chamber pres ure, and so long as the throttling valve remains undisturbed, subsequent adjustment will realize the one when tho other is realized. To complete the
setting of conditions, the carburetor throttle position is adjusted in combination with the pump
intake by-pas , to give the required carburetor outlet pressure at the chamber pressure previously ~et. When this is attained, and it is very speedily accomplished, all three pressures are
at the desired values.
One of the chief functions of the plant is the !1ccurate determination of the ratio of air to
fuel in the mixture. Having set the air How and other conditions incident to it, as above, the
weights on the fuel scale are adjusted so that the beam i about to' drop. When thi occurs,
through removal of the liquid from the tank under demand by the carburetor, the circuit through
the watch control is closed and the watch started. The required weight is now removed from
the scale beam, and the operator i free to record his observation of pressures, temperature,
pulsator speed, and amplitude, and to maintain the setting, should this be required, while
the run gees on. When tho predetermined weight of fuel has been metered by the carburetor,
the scale beam again drops, stopping tho watch. A record of the time taken fo1' the given weight
of fuel completes the run.
For convenience, graph have been prepared showing the discharges in pOlmds of air per
second plotted against difference in pressure for each of the several metering orifices included in
the equipment. Other charts aro developed for special cases, and will be discussed in detail in
those roports dealing with the cases in which they are used.
In general carburetor development work, that is, without special reference to a particular
engine or class of service, the extreme flexibility of the plant permits the whole usable range of
operation to be investigated under any and all of the combinations of conditions likely to .be met
in service.

TICE.

R~SUMlt

The following report is a discussion of experimentally determined variations in the value
of the coefficient of discharge for small bore, short passages as used to meter fuel in carburetors.
Variations in the overall coefficient (0) are discussed with respect to passage diameter,
passage length as a function of the ratio of length to diameter (LID), form of entrance, and effect
of change in fluidity of the fuel with temperature change.
The most important conclusion reached is thai control of the range of mi."ture ratios
delivered by u, carburetor is obtainable tlu'oughout the practical limits of desiru,bility by simple
selection of the ratio of length to diameter (LID) for the fuel metering passage, provided other
conditions remain substantially constant.
DISCHARGE CHARACTERISTICS OF FUEL METERING NOZZLES IN CARBURETORS.

The discharge of liquid from carburetor"fuel metering passages or jets is most conveniently
considered when the characteristic values of the overall coefficient (0) in the expression
V = 0.J2gh are studied. This expression becomes
W=60.2 0 a-/p

.Jh

(1)

where W=weight of fuel discharged in pounds per minute,
0= a coefficient,
a = area of passage in square inches,
p=specrnc gravity of fuel discharged (referred to water at 60 0 F.)
h = head or pressure drop across the passage, expressed in inches of water.
The value of 0, it is to be noted, includes all losses due to both skin friction and internal
or fluid friction, as well as the loss incident to contraction of the stream through the passage,
and to so-called end effects. These losses vary with change in head (h), with change in shape
of entrance to the passage, with change in the ratio of length to diameter (LID) of the passage,
and with the temperature (T) of the fuel, considering anyone fuel. The influence of change
in the temperature upon the value of (0) is the result of the change in viscosity of the liquid
with change in temperature. A rise in temperature is accompanied by a lowering of the
viscosity and a consequent increase in the value of the relative fiuidity.2 Thus, considering
different fuels discharged from the same passage at the same temperature, those having higher
lluidity values will possess higher values for (0) in equation (1). Obviously those fuels having
a higher rate of increase in fluidity with a given temperature rise will also have a higher rate
of increase in the value of (0). In general, those fuels having smaller fluidities possess the

greater rates of increase in fluidity value with a given rise in temperature.' This is clearly
shown in plot 6, from Herschel,3 !1nd explains why it is that the heavier the fuel the more variant
is its discharge rate with temperature change.
The general effect of alteration of the shape of the pas age entrance is shown 4 in plot 1.
Here the diameter is constant, and the LID and T substantially so, the only significant change
being the bren.king of the sharp, square edge to a depth of a few thousandths of an inch. Probably the major effect of this chamfering is to reduce the contraction of the stream in the entrance;
at, in this case, heads above 2 inches. of water. While the coefficient (0) has considerably
higher values with increase of (h) with the entrance chamfered in this way, it will be noted also
that its value varies through wider limits. This mayor may not be desirable, depending upon
surrounding conditions with respect to the a.ir flow through the carburetor. However, chamfering has this very practical advantage in carburetor manufacture, that the angle and depth
of the chamfer, within comparatively wide limits, have an almost negligible effect on the discharge; while, on the other hand, small departures from truth in the making o'f sharp square
edges result in wide variations in the discharge. This, taken with the great difficulty of producing duplicate parts having square edges free from burr, practically rules out the square
edge for carburetor metering passages.
In plot 1, as in all the others with the exception of plot 5, the discharges considered 'Were
obtained from passages having entrances chamfered as noted in plot 1. Furthermore, all run
were made with submerged passages, with the exception of two shown in plot 5. The two
chief reasons for employing submerged passages are: The instability of the discharge under
very small heads for pa sages discharging into air; and the fact that the jet discharging into
air is rapidly becoming obsolete in carburetor practice.
Within the range of metering passage diameters used in general carburetor practice it is
found that the value of (0) increases with increase of CD), plot 2.
The effect upon (0) and upon the limits between which it varies with change in the ratio
LID, are brought out in plots 3 and 4. In the former , (0) is plotted against (h) for several
values of LID, with (D) a con tant o Plot 4 is another form of expression of these same points,
with (0) plotted against L ID, each curve being representative of a constant value for (h).
The usefulness in practice of the control exercised over the values and range of values of
(0) following control of the ratio LID, is found when it is attempted to secure mixture ratio
compensation of a definite order of variation, with a given range of controlling values for (h).
These latter will vary with the forms given the air passages, and with the general design of
the carburetor, as discu sed in Parts III, IV, and V of this report. In general, there is more or
less fitting by selection to be clone in bringing about the desired compensation control in a
carburetor; and plots 3 and 4 point out a very simple way to accomplish almost any desired
result in compensation.
A change in temperature affects the discharge from a passage in two ways-through its
influence on the density (p), and by virtue of the change in fluidity. It is obvious from a consideration of equation (1) that for ordinary variations in (T) the effect of the accompanying
change in (P) is of no great consequence, since the change in (p) is comparatively small and
the discharge varies as -liThe group of three curves in plot 5, for gasoline discharged from the same passage at three
temperature, expresses the order of magnitude of the effect upon (0) of change in fluidity
with the change in (T), for a comparatively long passage, in which this effect is much greater
than in the case with ordinary smaller values for LID found in carburetor practice .

METERING CHARACTERISTICS OF CARBURETORS.

17

Attention is called to the curves in plot 5 for the very short, square edged passages discharging into air. Here the variation in (0) is a minimum with respect to both (h) and (T). A
change in (T) from 24.5° O. to 4° 0., it will be seen, results in no appreciable change in (0) at
anyone value of (h).
CONCLUSIONS.

(1) Ohamfering the entrance of a fuel metering passage increases both the value and the
range of values for the coefficient (0) of discharge.
(2) Wide variations in the angle and depth of chamfer at entrance have almost inappreciable effect upon (0), with respect to both its value and range of values with change of head (h ) .
(3) Small variations, due to burr or otherwi e, at entrance of square edge metering passages
account for inadmissable irregularities in discharge. This makes it highly undesu:able to
employ this form of entrance where ready production of many identically performing parts is
sought.
~4) Submerged fuel metering passages are free from instability and irregularity of discharge
when the head (h) is very small.
(5) The value of the coefficient (0) of discharge increases with increase of diameter (D) of
the passage, for passages of appreciable length.
(6) The value of the coefficient (0) of discharge increases, and its range of values decreases,
with decrease in the length to diameter ratio (LjD).
(7 ) Suitable selection of the ratio LID in a fuel metering pas age permit of obtaining
almost any useful relationship between air and fuel in a mixture, other conditions remaining
substantially constant.
(8) The value of the coefficient (0) of discharge increases with the fluidity of the fuel ,
which varies with the temperature (T).
(9) The smaller the fluidity value of the fuel, at a given temperature, the greater the rate
of increase of fluidity with rise of temperature, and therefore the greater the rate of increase
of the coefficient (0) with rise in temperature.
(10) Increase in the ratio LID serves to increase the effect upon the coefficient (0) of
changes in fluidity following changes in temperature.
(11) The discharge from square edged orifices in thin plates (LjD = 0.25 or less) is inappreciably affected by wide variations in temperature of the fuel.

CHARACTERISTICS OF AIR FLOW IN CARBURETORS. 1

RESUME.

The following report is a discussion of experimentally determined values of the coefficient
of discharge for the air passages, and of the loss in pressure at the carburetor outlet, in carburetors of the plain tube type. These values are con idered, for the complete carburetor
assembly, with respect to passage form, air density, the admission of fuel to the air stream,
and method of spraying or dividing the liquid.
The more important conclusions reached are: That the coefficient of discharge has an
almost constant value for throat velocities greater than about 145 feet per second, for any
one carburetor; that below a throat velocity of 145 feet per second the coefficient rapidly becomes smaller; that considerable variations in passage form only slightly modify the coefficient;
that the coefficient is practically unaltered by change in atmospheric density, or by admission
of fuel to the air stream; and that the pressure loss through carburetors varies with the design
of the passages, and with the method of admission and spraying of the fuel.
CHARACTERISTICS OF AIR FLOW IN CARBURETORS.

The flow of air in a plain tube carburetor (one having a single air passage without control
other than the engine throttle valve) is most conveniently considered as flow through a nozzle
having an infinite area (AI) of entrance, and in which, therefore, the pressure at entrance (PI)
is that of the surrounding atmosphere. Carburetors of this type always include a constriction
or throat in which the velocity of the air is increased to provide a drop in pressure to cau e
fuel to be ejected into the air stream. The throat area is the least area of section along the
axis of the air passage. In such a case the weight of air taken through the carburetor may be
written 2

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Published reports of tests of air flow through nozzles or Venturi tubes are few in number,
unfortunately, and include only work with comparatively large tubes (2 inches or more throat
diameter), having straight axes and without obstruction at throat or entrance. These tests
have resulted in the assignment of throat coefficient values ranging from 0.94 to 0.99, for passages having equal entrance and exit diameters (D 1 and D s, respectively) and a throat diameter
(D 2 ) equal to or less than 0.5 D 1 • In these tubes the converging entrance has been found to have
an optimum included angle never greater than 30°, and is joined to the diverging portion by a
short cylindrical section comprising the throat, and having well rounded junctions with each.
Further, the diverging down-stream portion or adjutage is found to have an optimum included
angle of between 5° and 7.5°.
The inclusion in a oarburetor design of a passage possessing the above general specifications
is obviously difficult if not impossible. A consideration of intake system requirements in an
engine seems to preclude the employment of a diameter ratio of D2/Da = 0.5 or less. A definite
and narrow range of values for Da exists in a given case; and a reduction of throat area to 0.25
that of the manifold is inadmissible because of the requirements of high oharge pumping capaoity
in an engine, and of maintenance of a fairly definite range of heads controlling the fuel discharge.
Considerations of space available for the carburetor, of the desirability of minimum bulk
with universality of application of that device, of the frequent need for a supply of heated air,
or of fire prevention, make it necessary to modify the entrance by curving its axis more or less
abruptly, and make it highly desirable to increase the included angle of the adjutage. Then, too,
fuel must be admitted to the till'oat to secure proper metering relations; and this calls for obstructions in the form of jets and their supporting bosses. A throttle valve must be included for
engine control.
Taking these points all together, it is reasonably to be expected that the air flow in a carburetor will have a different and smaller efficiency figure or coefficient than obtains for the
simple passage of optimum form.
The work, of which the following is a summary, was done in the Bureau of Standards
carburetor testing plant,s and was undertaken to determine experimental values for the coefficient
of discharge (0) in equation (1), for rather widely differing examples of carburetors of the plain
tube form. The whole carburetor was employed in each case, as installed on the engine, the
object being to determine effective values of the coefficient for the carburetor as a whole, rather
than corresponding values for the throat member alone and removed from its service environment. These latter are, in general, fictitiously high referred to service conditions, as is shown
in the resul ts.
.
The carburetors used are referred to in the following as carburetor A/ figure 1, and carburetor B,t figure 2. The essential dimensions of the till'oat members of these two carburetors
are given in the diagrams and data of figure 3, together with those for an air nozzle 01 approximately optimum form.
Carburetors A and B were designed for use on the same engine, in which three cylinders,
5-inch bore by 7-inch stroke, are supplied by each throat. The air taken by these cylinders
at 1,700 r. p. m. under full throttle opening, at the several barometric pressures, is shown
graphically in plot 4, in which are also shown the corresponding air densities at the mean temperature of the tests (62.8° F.), and the altitudes in feet equivalent to these densities. s The
quantities of air read from the curve of plot 4 are the maxima taken through the carburetors
in these tests; and the lesser quantities taken to complete the description of the coefficient
variations were secured by throttling the air supply to the carburetor chamber. For convenience
in manipulation, the carburetor throttles were kept fully opened throughout the tests, since it
• A (ully illustrated description o( the Bureau o( Standards carburetor testing plant is given in Part I of this report.
• Carburetor A is the Zenith Carburetor Co.'s dual design used as equipment on large engines. It is fitted with a throat member haYing a
minimum bore 01 31 mm. (1.22 inches), and is compensated , as are all Zenith carburetors, by compounding the nozzles.
Carburetor B Is an experimental design by the Stewart-Warner Speedometer Corporation , developed to possess inherent mb.:ture compensation
for altitude. It bas a throat 011.312 inches mininlum bore, and is compensated by balancing the fioat chamber pressure against that at the throat
outlet.
NOTE.-It was intended to include other carburetors in this portion olthe work, but owing to structural and design peculiarities in those others
that were available it was impossible to obtain for them coefficient values directly comparable with those lor the simpler structures here described.
• A complete discussion with curves giving t.he relations of pressure, temperature, and density with altitude forms a portion of Part V of this
report.

OM HTTEE '["OR AERONAUT1CS.

The curve for carburetor A, plot 7, having a tube of the same general form as throats C
and D, and with (A 2 /A 3 ) equal to 0.360, is superior at high specific rates of discharge, even
though it includes a jet, bosses, a cur\"ed aA:is of entrance, and a throttle valve. It may be that
tube A possesses more nearly the optimum dimensions, considering its form, for the conditions
than either tube C or D; but this is not likely, considering the whole data from this work.
ince
mere change in the area relationship has only a \"ery small effect upon CPa) at a given specific
discharge, and since for a given specific discharge the skin friction in like passages will be sub!tantially constant, it seems probable that the increase in (P a) in cai'buretor ,compared with
tubes C and D at high specific discharges, is accounted for on the ground of a up pression of
turbulence in the stream.
In carburetor A there nrc two jets, one within the other, and from the annular passage thn
formed is discharged a column of air. The effect of such a cloumn of air issuing into the throat
parallel with the general line of flow, ffill be to suppress eddying in the wake of the nozzle and
its boss, and thus accomplish a rise in pressure in the air stream.
ince at large throat pressures
small volumes of air will pass through the nozzle, the suppression of turbulence by the nozzle
air column will be smaller than at low throat pressures, corresponding to high rates of discharge,
Continuing with plot 7 and considering the curves for carburetor B and its throat, the immcdiately foregoing statements are seen to be supported very fully, since in this CElse the column
of air admitted by the nozzle has several times the cross-sectional area of that in carburetor A.
This is included in the carburetor design for the primary purpose of assisting in securing a fine
.
division or spraying of the fueL
In the observations on the throats alone, no air was admitted as by the nozzles. The
greater values of the curve for throat B, compared with those for tubes C and D, is explained in
great measure by the mOre favorable- adjutage form, with respect to the maintenance of line flow.
The foregoing on the effect of inclusion in a carburetor design of a column of air discharging
from the nozzle is further illustrated br the outlet pressure curv~s for carburetors A and B,
plots 5 and 6. The increase in cPa) for carburetor B as compared with carburetor A is greatest
at the greatest a tmospheric pressure, and becomes less as the pressure is reduced.
Admission of fuel to the air stream in all cases causes the value of cP3) to suffer a loss, plot,
5 and 6. It is pointed out that this is functional with both the quantity of fuel and ,vith the
mode of spraying. It seems that the latter is, in general, of the greater consequence, and that
utilization of a column of air of appreciable sectional area in the nozzle, to a sist division of
the liquid, improves the efficiency of the spraying device with resp ct to the amount of energy
used in accomplishing the spraying.
CON LUSlONS.

(1) The coefficient of discharge for anyone of the carburetor pa sages te ted has an almost
constant and maximum value for effective throat velocities greater than about 150 feet per
second.
(2) The value for the coefficient of discharge for the car buretor pas ages tested lies
between O. 2 and O. 5, under service conditions. These valves are probably typical of reasonably well formed passages of similar type.
(3) The coefficient of discharge for carburetor pa sages of thi type is apparently onlr
slightly modified as a result of considerable changes in passage form, with respect to angles of
entrance and ac1jutage.
(4) The coefficient of discharge for a carburetor passage is practically unaffected by 'wi 10
variations in atmospheric density (less than 1 per cent maximum variation between the densit)limits of 0.075 and 0.035 pounds per cubic foot).
(5) The coefficient of discharge for a carburetor passage is practicallr unaffected hy the
introduction of fuel to th air stream (fuel di charge introduces irregulari ties not to exceed
plus or minus 1 per cent).
(6) The pressure loss in hecnrburetoroutletchanges with the turbulence or intel'llal motion
of the air stream.
(7) The pressure loss ill the carburetor outlet changes with the quantity of fuel admitted
to the air stream} and with the m thod of dividing the fuel by spraying.

RESUME.

The following report is offered as an indication of the order of magnitude of the variations
in fuel metering and in effective carburetor capacity resulting from modifications of both the
period and amplitude of the intake system pulsations. Experimental results with two carburetors possessing widely differing metering structures are briefly discussed.
As a result of the work done, it is concluded: (1) The effect upon carburetor capacity of
usual rates and amplitudes of intake pulsations is so small as to be practically negligible; and
(2) the metering is affected sufficiently to warrant that pulsation rate and amplitude be taken
into account in developing the fitting of a carbUl"etor to an engine.
EFFECTS OF PULSATING Am FLOW IN CARBURETOR.

In aircraft service it is the accepted rule that not more than four engine cylinders be supplied with mixture by a single carbUl"etor. The usual arrangements are: A single carburetor
for engines having 4 cylinders or less, 2 carbUl"etors symmetrically disposed for 6 and 8 cylinder
engines, and 4 carbUl"etors, also symmetrically di posed for engines of 12 and 16 cylinders.
Each carbUl"etor supplies either 3 or 4 cylinders.
It may be taken that such a carbUl"etor disposal has come to be the accepted one because
with it the engine volumetric efficiency is slightly higher than where a carbUl"etor is made to
serve a greater number of cylinders. The demand of one cylinder is not overlapped by that
of another, in the carbUl"etor and manifolding, with such an arrangement; and, in all probability, in the present state of manifold design, charge distribution is also somewhat simplified.
But aside from the results experienced with respect to volumetric efficiency, or with respect to
qualitative or quantitative charge distribution, it is worthy of note that both the period and
amplitudc of the pressure fluctuation in the intake system are made greater than in the case
where more cylinders arc served by a carburetor. The pressure fluctuations or pulsations in
the intake passages have an interesting bearing on the metering performance of the carburetor.
At the outset it mu t be tated that no generally applicable analysis of the effects of pulsating flow in a carbUl"etor is po sible, since each combination of carburetor-intake piping and
.
engine cylinders constitutes a separate and special case.
The following matter, based upon the results of a small group of observations in the
Bureau of Standards carburetor testing plant, is offe red as an indication of the order of magnitude of the variations in fuel metering and in effective carburetor capacity resulting from
modification of both the period and amplitude of the intake pulsations. The experimental
results apply only to the case of a given short length (15 inches) of straight pipe serving as the
carbUl"etor outflow passage, between the carbUl"etor flange and the pulsator spindle.
Manifold branchings between the several cylinders of an engine and the common carburetor
outflow passages have an important bearing on the natUl"e of the pulsations in the latter and

ANNUAL REPORT NATIO AL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

n the carburetor: Opportunity has not as yet presented itself for an experimental study of
this phase of the problem; but special apparatus in which the work can be done is now contemplated, and it is hoped to report on the whole subject, and in considerable detail at some
future date.
Owing to the arrangement of the carburetor te ting apparatus in which the present work
was done, pulsations occulTed in the air-metering orifice with carburetor chamber pressures
greater than 580 mm. of barometer column. Since it is essential that the air meter be undisturbed, the runs here recorded were made with the chamber tbxottled to 500 rom., this being
sufficient throttling to insure steady flow through the metering orifice.
Two carburetors, A and B (figs. 1 and 2), were run under the condition of full load at an
atmospheric pressure of 500 rom. Reference runs were made with steady flow in each case.
Pulsating flows, ranging in period from 600 to 4,200 per minute, were then induced, with the
same weight of air pas ing in unit time; and observations of pressures and mixture ratio were
obtained for each increment of pulsation rate. Three amplitudes of pulsation were included:
The minimum possible with the 'apparatus, an intermediate value, and the maximum possible.
Both carburetors were operated under identical conditions of both period and amplitude of
the pulsation .
The ob ervations of chamber, throat and outlet pressures re ult in the curves of coefficients of discharge and of pressure recovery ratios (Pa/P 1 ) in plots 3 and 4; and observations
of the fuel discharge permit a like statement of the effects of pulsations upon the metering or
charge proportioning.
At the time this work was done, it was impossible to record the amplitude of the pul ations. However, it may be taken that the minimum amplitude used was a reasonably close
approach to the condition of a single carburetor supplying eight or more cylinders, while the
maximum amplitude approached that experienced when a single carburetor supplies only three
cylinders, whose pumping strokes are dispo ed symmetrically.
In discussion of the curves of plot 3 and 4 it should be pointed out that those of the coefficient of discharge are of no great igni:ficance a a measure of carburetor capacity. They have
an important bearing, however, on the metering, and on the case where the carburetor throat
is being utilized as an au: meter, as i sometimes done in experimental and development work.
It may be taken that the curves of pressure recovery ratio (Pa/P 1 ) more nearly describe
the change in effective capacity "with change in period and amplitude of the pulsations. In
each of the carburetor , it will be noted, the period or pUlsation rate is of greater importance
than is the amplitude or pressure variation. In the set-up used, the maximum deviation
occurs in both cases at a pulsation rate of about 3,100 pel' minute. 'rhe curves approximate
the sine wave in form, as a result of rc onance effects in the passages.
In any case, within the limit of the work, the maximum variation in effective capacity as
a result of pulsating flow, is of the order of one-half of 1 pel' cent.
As would be expected, the metering is somewhat mOl'e importantly affected, depending
upon the interrelation of part and passages controlling it. Thus, in carburetor A, where only
changes in throat pressure effect the fuel flow, the metering is only little disturbed, and that
consistently with the change in apparent throat coefficient. In carburetor B, on the other
hand, where both the throat and the float chamber pressure are subject to separate modification by the pulsations, the result is quite different. The mean value of the mL'(ture ratio ov r
a considerable range of period is that found under steady flow conditions. But the ratio varies
harmonically through fairly wide limits a the pUlsation period is changed.
In conclusion it can be stated, in the light of the little work done, that (1) the effect upon
carburetor capacity of used rates and amplitudes of pulsation is so small as to be practically
negligible, and that (2) the metering is affected sufficiently to warrant that pulsation rate and
amplitude be taken into account in developing a fitting of a carburetor to an engine. In final
word, the amplitude of pressure pulsation is reduced to negligibility upon throttling to between
0.5 and 0.6 of the full-load air capacity in a carburetor.

NATURAL AND REQUIRED METERING CHARACTERISTICS OF CARBURETORS.l

. 'l'ICJ;.

R£SUMR

The following report is ,t discussion of the theoretical a.nd experimental mixture proportioning t;haracteristics of carburetors as applied to the conditions of aircraft ervice; ani! chiefly
eonsiders the weight relationship of air to fuel in the mL'{ture with respect to var,ving atmospheric
pressure and temperature. Since a statement of carburetor performallee is of li.ttle value in
the absence of a correspollding statement of what is required, it has seemed advisable to group
carburetor performance with engine requiremen ts, and eon ider the two together, It is thought
that the present treatment of Lhe e two r eally distinct matters is fully justified in the absence of
any prior definition of what constitutes the optimum performance of a carburetor,
The experimental work on which the r eport is based includes inve tigations of aircraft
engines and their requirements and of five carburetors, between the limits of mean annual
pressme at groun llevd and that correspondu1g approximately to 30,000 feet altitude. Compensation characteristics of thTee of the carburetors are studied in detail, at each of several
atmospheric pressures, at all loads lmder throttle between full load and one-tenth load, cor1'eponding to idling of the engine,
4 new type of carburetor posses ing (llmo t complete inherent altimetric compensation
\
is included and it pClformance analyzed ,
With r espect to engine requi.remellt , the more important conclu ions rettched are: (1) The
mixture ratio for maximum power i pracLiealiy a con tant (at about 15 for the gasoline) at all
air densities; (2) the optimum mixture raLio , considered from the standpoint of maximum fuel
economy, is not constant, but docroa es with tho atmospheric density; and (3) the optimum
lTILxture mu t be increasingly richer in fuel at part loads under throttle than under full throttle.
With respect to natural carburetor performance, it is concluded: (1) The ordinarily employed
variations in structure and in method of fuel control in carburetors effect inappreciable modifications of the altimetric compensation ; (2) the ordinarily employed varia,tions in arburetor
structure and in method of fuel control very m ateriall,V" modify the mixture ratio with load
change under tlU'ottle; and (:3) a plain-tube carburetor -ithout moving parts controlling the
fuel discharge can be made to gi"\E\ a working approximation to complete nltimetric correction
of the mixture.
NATURAL METERING CHARACTERISTICS.

In aircmft service the ,outstanding, cau es of variation in mix Lure proportioning in
carburetors arc change in atmospheric pressure, change in atmospheric tempcrftture, and change
in load. It must be pointed out tha t the directio n and extent of the variation with load depends
upon the design of the carhuretor, and is capable of control independently of the atmo ph erie
pressure or temperature.
Refened to altitude in feet above the earth' surface, the curves of p.lot 1 giye the mean

METERING CHARACTERISTICS OF CARBURETORS .

33

Considering ordinary carburetor mountings on au'craft, it appears that the carburetor air
supply will always be at a temperature somewhat above that of the atmosphere. In fact, in
many cases, the change in carburetor air temperature will be relatively small throughout a
flight, even though great altitudes are attained. Thus it may be taken that the curves of
plot 2 for a constant carburetor air temperature more nearly describe the enrichment rates
to be expected in service than do those where the carburetor air temperature is that of the
atmosphere.
FUEL VISCOSITY,

In further discussion of plot 2, it should be pointed out that a carburetor may have a fuel
metering orifice the discharge from which is considerably affected by change in the visco ity
of the fuel with temperature change. So great is the viscosity control of the discharge for
large length to diameter ratios in the jet, that it is possible to select a jet proportion which
will largely correct the mixture ratio under the variations in temperature of plot 1. But since
the adventitious changes in temperatlu'e of the atmosphere during any flight are not necessarily orderly, and do not necessarily follow the anllual mean of plot 1, such correction can
not be relied upon. The daily or even hourly temperature variation at anyone level may be
as much as 50 per cent of the total variation of the annual mean between ground and 15,000
feet altitude.
However, mixture ratio variations with fuel vi cosity change 4 must be considered in
aircraft carbu'l:etor performance if the carburetor is subjected to considerable temperature
variations, since the development of load compensation in carburetors almost always includes
jet modifications in which the viscosity effect i not inappreciable.
FUEL CONSUMPTIOl

AND POWER.

In the B. M. E. P . -mixture ratio diagram of plot 3 appears the ratio curve of plot 2 for
Tx= To; and below are given B. M. E. P. vs. density curves corresponding to this mixture ratio
variation and to the constant maximum power ratio of 15. The relative specific consumption
(relative lb./h.p./hr.) curve for the natural ratio variation, considered together with the natural
and the maximum B. M. E. P. curves, brings out clearly that the major effect of the natural
enrichment in a carburetor is not so much represented by a failure in the development of
power as by a loss in fU'el economy. This amounts to 50 per cent at an atmospheric density
of 0.030 pound per cubic foot .
For the attainment of maximum indicated fuel economy, the specific consumption must
be maintained constant at all air den itie . The natural discharge of fuel, W x , must hence
be reduced to wx ', and the relative reduction in fuel discharge is represented by

•

the change in speed being neglected and Tx taken as equal to To .
Considering only the engine and its behavior, the specific fuel consumption (in pounds
per I. H. P. per hour) Fi , on the basis of the indicated mean effective pres ure, Pi, varies only
inversely as the value of the mixture ratio. Thus the indicated economy of an engine goes on
increasing right up to the superior or maximum air/fuel limit of combustibility of the charge.
But the usefulness of an engine is proportional to its brake mean effective pressure in
pounds per square inch, P b ; and the value of P b is not a definite function of Pi' As a consequence it is impossible to wTite a general expTession for the brake specific consumption, Fb ,
without including empirical P b values . However, having experimental data describing the
relationships between P b and R, the optimum values of R with re pect to economy of operation, are readily found .
By definition : Fb=w/B.H.P.; W= W/R; B.H .P. varies as NP b; and therefore the relative
specific consumption, Fb , varies as W/RNPb • But also, in the case of an engine with a propel-

MAXIMUM ECO OMY.

Solving this expression, including the values of p, Rand P b in plot 3, results in the maximum
economy or optimum R values shown in plot 5, curve A. Since the engine from which these
data were obtained is typical of the best practice in water-cooled aircraft engines, it is admissible
here to make the general statement that the optimum value of the mixture ratio lmder open
throttle is not a constant with varying atmospheric density, and that it is very approximately
represented by R = 106p + 15, the equation for the "maximum economy" curve at A, in plot 5.
Expressing this relationship as a per cent of the ground mixture ratio results in the characteristic enrichment curve of plot 5 at 0, designated "maximum economy." In considering
this curve it must not be overlooked that it can apply only in the case of realization of the
experimental optimum ratio at grolmd level. The enrichment at any atmospheric density,
necessary to secure maximum power as distinguished from maximum economy· (from plot 3),
is represented in plot 4 by the difference between the ordinate values of the two curves 0 and
D at the density in question. For ready comparison, the optimum ratio values from curve A,
plot 4, are indicated in plot 3 as those of maximum economy.
Since the rates of change in the specific consumption are very small in the neighborhood
of the optimum values, plot 4, it is desirable in practice to work with r atios smaller than the
optimum, in view of the increased outputs obtainable, and considering that by this device
small irregularities in the functioning of the carburetor will less impair the regularity of the
engine performance. Thus a ratio of 20 at ground density is seldom exceeded.
CARBURETOR OBSERVATIONS.

In the following summary of observations of natural metering characteristics of carburetors,
in the Bureau of Standards' carburetors testing plant, the air t emperature was maintained
constant at all pressures in any set or group of runs. Thus the possible change in mixture ratio
with fuel viscosity change does not appear, and the order of magnitude of the variation in the
mixture proportion can be considered as very approximately that to be expected in many of the
ordinary service environments of carburetors.
The work represents a complete study of mixture ratio and its variations throughout
a range of densities of from 0.075 to 0.030 pound per cubic foot (zero altitude to approximately
30,000 feet) for both open and part throttle settings of the carburetor. Each of the several
carburetors included was designed to supply mixture to three Liberty engine cylinders, 5 inches
bore by 7 inches stroke. Under open throttle it was found by test 5 of this engine that the
weight of air taken by three cylinders was 0 .225 pound per second at an air density of 0.075
and at 1,700 r. p. m., and that the air taken at other densities was as the relative density.
The chart of plot 6 gives graphically the relations of air weight and manifold pressure drop
for these three cylinders, under the several conditions of air density and of loading, as developed
from data of engine tests in the Bureau of Standards' altitude laboratory.5 By the term load
is here meant that portion of the open-tm:ottle air weight t aken at the designated value of the
load. In the runs involving throttle closure, the controls of the carburetor and of the testing
plant were adjusted to maintain the values indicated in plot 6.
• The Bureau of Standards' altitude laboratory is fully described and illustrated in Report No. 44.

METERING CHARACTERISTICS OF CARBURETORS.

The mixture ratio observations on each carburetor are presented in two ways-ratio and
per cent variation in ratio with density for several loads, and ratio and per cent variation in
ratio with 10adJor the several densities. The former expresses the altimetric compensation at
the several relative loads, and the latter the load compensation with change in density. In
each case, the per cent variation is stated in terms of the full load ratio at the ground.
The five carburetors included in the observations are designated in the following as A, B,
C, D, and E,6 and are shown in diagrammatic section in figures 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, respectively.
The results of the observations are shown in plots 12 to 20, inclusive.
Considering the natural altimetric compensation curves 7 of plots 12 and 13, for carburetors
A and C, it appears that the full-load characteristics of these carburetors are practically identical, and are those of the theoretical case of plot 2, with Tx= To . . The variations in the values
found are only of such an order as might be expected in two designs embodying the differences
in structure and method represented by the two cases. For all loads less than full load, and
at all densities, the enrichments found in carburetor C are greater than in A, and this increase
in fuel content is relatively greater at the larger densities. This is clearly presented in the corresponding load compensation curves of plots 15 and 16, and results from the differences in the
two methods of fuel control under throttle. With small densities the natural full-load enrichments are so great that the characteristic changes in ratio with load become of lesser significance.
The load compensations, with respect to the peculiarities of structure of each device, are
considered separately from the altimetric compensations, and their analyses are grouped together in the latter part of this report.
The altimetric compensation characteristics of carburetor B, plot 14, merit some discussion,
since they depart markedly from those for conventional carburetors. The relatively greater
pressure loss through a carburetor with smaller atmospheric pressures,s as in plot 18, for carburetor B at open throttle, is utilized to reduce the head ejecting fuel from the metering jet
under this condition. The weight of fuel discharged in this carburetor is expressed w = P a - P z,
where P a is the throat outlet pressure communicated to the float chamber and P 2 is that at the
nozzle outlet. For anyone value of the relative 10ad,W/P= V=a constant; hence Pz/P=a
constant and P 2 = cPo But Ps/P is not a constant, since the relative loss due to friction through
the carburetor increases with lesser values of P and bears the relationship, from plot 18,

~3=aP+b;

and P a=aP2+bP, where a is the slope of the curve, plot 18, and b its intercept on
the PaW axis. Substituting in the expression for weight of fuel discharged, we have
w =.JaPZ+bP-cP, from which it appears that when b is equal to c
w ccP, and that

wx=Wo~:, which is the relationship giving an invariable mixture ratio with altitude change.
• Carburetor A (fig. 7) is the Zenith Carburetor Co. 's deSign, used as equipment on aeronautic engines. It is compensated for load changes by
compounding the two nozzle discharges, one of them passing into an intermediate atmospheric well. Altimetric mixture correction is secured by
a manually operated plug valve controlling the float chamber pressure. 'l'he setting used is as follows: Throat, 1.22 inches diameter; main jet,
No. 140; compensator jet, No. 150; and idling well, No. 100. The numbers of the jets indicate the cubic centimeters of water discharged per minute
under Ii 12-inch head.
Carburetor B (fig. 8) is an experimental design by the Stewart-Warner Speedometer Corporation, developed to possess inherent altimetric
mixture regulation. The throttle is placed in the air intake, to secure maximum pressure differences on the spraying device. Compensation for
load changes is secured by equalization of the float chamber pressure With that in the throat outlet. 'l'he setting used is as follows: Throat, 1.312
inches diameter; fuel passage, 0.067 inch diameter; and air passage through the nozzle, 0.199 inch minimum diameter.
Carburetor C (fig. 9) is an aeronautic type produced by the Stromberg Motor Devices Co. It is compensated for load changes by tbe sizes and
spacings of air and fuel portings in tbe assembly of the main nozzle member. Both fuel and air discharge into tbe throat of the main air passage.
Altimetric correction of the mixture is by regulation of the float chamber pressure, either by a hand operated valve or by an automatic valve under
control of an aneroid bellows. The setting used is as follows: Main air throat, 1.50 incbes diamater; main fuel jet,O.089 inch diameter; atmospheric
vent to the well, four holes 0.038 inch diameter.
Carburetor D (fig. 10) is the vortex type produced by the Ensign Carburetor Co. Air enters the vortex cbamber tangentially, and its rotation
causes a lowering of tbe pressure at the center of the mass, where the fuel is admitted. 'l'he work done on this carburetor included only enough
runs to define its natural altimetric compensation under open throttle.
Carburetor E (fig. 11) is a design produced by the Marvel Carburetor Co. It is characterized by the upstream inclination of its fuel discharge
passagcs, which is relied upon to give load compensation, except at idling. Altimetric correction is obtained by a large manually operated plug
valve admitting air directly to the passage on the engine side of tbe throat. Only its natural open tbrottle altimetric performance was studied
1 It should be clearly understood that throughout the investigation of carburetors, included in this report, no attempt was made to correct the
mLxture proportions by manipulation of the control provided for tbat p~pose. Only the natural changes in ratio were studied, or are of interest
in the present case, since anything desired can be obtained ,vith suitable setting of the control member.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Actually it is not possible to make b and c equal. And, considering the need for somewhat
enriched mixtures for maximum economy at reduced pr essures (plots 3 and 4), it is undesirable
t o reduce b to equ ality with c. It is obvious that the ratio of the passage areas. (A. 2
/A.) controls
the value of c, and that b is largely controllable in the design of the fuel nozzle and the adjutage
of the air throat,s since it is functional with the turbulence in the air stream. Since b is normally greater than c in good designs permitting the attainment of high values for the volume~ric
efficiency in an engine, it is evident that with a given c the only way to obtain smaller b values
is by an incr ease in the turbulence in the throat adjutage, thus obtaining mixture control at
the expense of effective capacity. It follows that adjustment of tpe relationship between b
and c is bes t accomplished by manipulation of the ratio of areas A.2/A..
Reference to figure 10 s~ows that the metering structure of cal'buretor D is wholly different
from the foregoing cases in that the air stream is early set in ro tation by virtue of i ts
tangential entrance to the so-called vortex chamber. The rotation of the air mass within the
chamber causes a lowering of the pressure at its center, due to the action of cen trifugal force.
In this case the metering head on the fuel is directly as the difference between the pressure of
the atmosphere and that at the axis of r otation. Since the latter varies as P, as does also the
pres ure at the throat in a conventional tube type carburetor , the fundamental compensation
characteristics are identical in the two cases. The observed altimetric compensation of carburetor D is shown in plot 19.
Carburetor E , figure 11, is a tube type in which the fuel discharges at the till'oat from
passages inclined at 45° with reference to the axis of the passage, thus facing them somewhat
against the air stream. The r esult is that the difference in pressure to which the metering
passage is subjected is less than that with the ordinary jet structure. The pressure at the
throat varies as P, as in the typical case, but is modified with r espect to the fuel discharge
passages by the changing lines of flow, with changing velocity, about the piece in which the
discharge passages are formed . Also the metering head varies inversely as some function of
the density of the air passing the openings. The gross result is represented by an altimetric
compensation curve, plo t 19, which, starting at ground density, at first has a smaller rate of
enrichment than has the simple conventional case. This r ate becomes an increasingly greater
one as the density is reduced, until at a density of 0.030 pound per cubic foot, the rate of enrichment is very approximately one and one-half times that for the theoretical case.
COMPRESSION RATIO AND PERMISSIBLE LOADING.

In aircraft engines the compression ratio may be anywhere between 4.5 and 6.5 (with certain
blended and modified fuels it is both possible and desirable to carry this ratio up to slightly
over 7.) With the resulting compression pressures it is possible to operate the engine at and
near full throttle on mixture ratios (air/fu el) up to and including 24. The approximate minimum
fuel consumption in pounds per B. H. P. per hour is obtained at full load at the ground with
a mixture r atio of about 20. Also, the output with this ratio is within about 3 per cent of the
maximum obtainable from the engine, plot 3.
Where the compression ratio is carried to 5.3 or above, as is usual in high output engines,
it is imperative that the engine be not operated with open till'ottle at the ground for more
than a very few moments at anyone time. For this reason it is the exception to operate land
aircraft at more than about 0. 85 load at and near the ground. At higher levels a greater relative
loading is permissible because of lowered air d ensity .
Thus it is permissible to de ign for a high-ceiling aircraft on the basis of reduced loading
at the ground. I n plot 19 the altimetric compensation characteristics of all five carburetors
are plotted on the basis of full load at all d ensities. For comparison, the altimetric characteristics of carburetor B is given, on the basis of 0.95 load at ground, varying to full load at a
density of 0.030 pound per cubic foot .

METERING CHARACTERISTICS OF CARBURETORS.

43

Considering the altimetric compensation between the density limits of 0.075 with 0.85
load, and 0.030 with full load, the relative performances of carburetors A, B, and C are as in
plot 20.
CONDITIONS CONTROLLING ECONOMY.

It is evident that mixtures of air and i'uel vapor are explosive in an engine cylinder between
widely separated limits of composition. While there is a superior limit, maximum air to fuel,
as well as an inferior one that can not be passed for the production of a usei'ul result, it is rather
toward the superior limit that it is found most advantageous to work, coru:idering the specific
00nsumption of fuel. Particularly is this true in aircraft service, where the fuel constitutes
a con iderable portion of the weight tran ported. Economy of fuel is of paramount importance.
Compared with the condition of open or nearly open throttle pelformance, the above applies
with equal force to the conditions of part load, since the major portion of an ordinary flight is
carried out with the engine delivering somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8 of its full power.
It is interesting to examine the probable rate at which the mixture ratio can be modified
most favorably under the conditions of part-load operation. There is but little experimen"tal
data on which the analysis can be based; and there are none that include simultaneously all
the conditions of engine operation.
The three external conditions fixing the ratio of maximum economy are those contnlling
the rate of propagation of the combustion: the temperature of the charge at the time of ignition;
its pressure at time of ignition; and it dilution with noncombining gases. There must be
mentioned also, ItS highly im00rtant contributing conoiti0ns, the turbulence in the ignited mass
of charge, and the extent of the initial ignition. But since these last are nearly constants in
anyone case, they very rea onably may be omitted at this time.
The temperature of the charge at time of ignition is functional ·with its temperature at the
beginning of compression, and with the compression ratio. The latter is fixed in anyone
case; and the former varies with the condition of the charge in the manifolding nnd with the
heat given up to it by the cylinder parts and by the residual gases in the cylinder.
Here it i" necessary to make some assumptions. The unv-aporized fuel content of the charge
at its entry to the cylinder is normally quite considerable. But it is possible for a mixture
having a suitable proportion of fuel to exist in a state of dryness at the pressures and ordinary
temperatures of the intake manifold. A con ideration of the cylinder charge temperature is
much simplified if it is as<;umed that the heat taken from the cylinder parts senT only to dry
es
the charge, without altering its temperature. On this basis, the increase in charge temperature
in the cylinder over that in the manifold is only that due to the mixing with the heated residua,]
gases from the preceding cycle. Since the mean specific heats of charge and residue are approximately equal, the re3ulting mean temperatme at end of the charging stroke may be expressed
11 = wcTc+wrTr
wc+w..

where w is weight and T absolute temperature of charge and residue, designated by the subscripts c and rJ respectively.
Knowing T I , the temperature at time of ignition T2 is found from the expression for

In the following Pl1 is taken equal to the mean intake manifold pressure, and the ratio vtfvz
equal t) 5.3.
The dilution D, of fresh charge with residual gases is D=wr/w c'
On this basis, from the curves of plot 6, and from additional engine-test data obtained
in the Bureau of Standards altitude laboratory, the cur ,res of plot 21 result as ap-Ploximately
describing characteristic variations in the ratio controlling conditions of pressure, temperature,
and dilution, under throttle.
EFFECTS OF COMPRESSION PRESSURE.

In constant volume experiments 10 it develops that the direct influence u-pon rate of combustion of initial pressure, other conditions being constant, is fairly small with mixtures of
about the theoretical combining proportions. However, with somewhat poorer mixtures, the
direct effect of change in initial pressure is of great importance, and becomes increasingly so
as the proportion of fuel is reduced. At the same time the ratio of pres ure rise (explosion
pressure/initial pressure) is practically a constant for a given mixture ratio, irrespective of the
initial pre sure. Tp.ese experimental relationships are expre sed graphically in plot 22, and
particular attention is called to the fact there generally indicated that as either limit of explosibility is approached, the times to attain maximum pressure are more nearly equal for different
initial pres ures. It is in the rea ion of the intermediate ratios that the major direct effect of
initial pressure are reali;r.ed with respect to rate of combustion.
The above supplies a qualitative explanation of the enrichment required under open
throttle as the atmospheric pres ure is reduced. Since an aircraft engine suffers only a comparatively small speed reduction with lowered atmospheric pressure, it is necessary that the
rate of combu tion of the charge be maintained somewhere near constancy for the attainment
of maximum economy.
ince the compression pressure is a direct function of the atmospheric
pressure, it follows that to maintain the rate of combustion the mixture must be enriched as the
atmospheric pressure is reduced.
Under part throttle the foregoing considerations of the effect of compression pressure apply ;
but there must also be taken into account the effects of change in charge temperature and of
change in dilution with products from the preceding cycle.
On the assumptions made in the foregoing, the temperature curves of plot 21 (for an engine
having a partially water-jacketed intake manifold) indicate that the temperature at end of
compression will change but slightly, and at the same time favoraoly, as the throttle opening
is reduced. Fot an appr()ximation, it may be taken that the influence of temperature chl1nges
may be neglected. In general the fuel in the mixture, cOQsidel'ing a gil-en rate of combustion,
must be an in verse function of the temperature 11 plot 23. Thi follows from the fact thl1t the
higher the charge temperature the less additionl11 heat will be needed to raise a given portion
of the charge to its ignition tempcrature; and consequently the less need be the heat of combustion to Cl1use propagation throughout the whole mass of the charge.
CHARGE DILUTION.

The separate and direct effectS of dilution of the charge with the chief combustion product
have been very thoroughly investigated, at atmospheric pres ure and temperatme, for mixtlU'es
of air with methane and with natural gas, diluted with carbon dioxide.ll For mixtures having
various ratios of ail' to fuel, SUbsequently diluted with varying proportions of CO2 , it is fOlmd
in all cases that the superior limit of explosibility, i. e., maximum air to fuel, is reduced as the
dilution is increased. This follows from two chief cause : The relatively high specific heat
capacity of carbon dioxide; and the dilution of the oxygen content of the charge. Plot 23
includes a plotting of the cxplo ibility limits for mixtures of air and natural gas diluted with
Bairstow and Alexander, Proc. Royal Soc. (Brit.) 1905: closed-vessel experiments on mhtures of coal gas and air.
The observatIons given in plot 23, on the controlling inauences of temper ture and dUu lion, are taken from U . S. Bureau 01 Mines Technicnl
Papers , No. 121 , Burell and Robertson, on The ElIects of Tempor ture and Pressure on tho Explosibility of Methane-Air MLxtu.rcs , and No. 43,

carbon dioxide. The graph may be taken as characteristic of the effects of such dilution upon
mixtures, of air and fuel vapor, at atmosphel'ic pressure and tempel'ature.
While it is impossible, in the absence of direct experimental data, to state definitely what
the combined enect of reduced compre. ~ion pressure and increased charge dilution will necessitate in the way of change in the air-fuel ratio, it is evident that such a combination will impose
a greater enrichment than will either one alone. If it is assumed (1) that the effect of change
in the one condition is unmodified by simultaneous chano-e in the other; (2) that the order
of variation in the optimum mi.:\:tme i the same with charge dilution a in the case of the
superior explo ive limit (plot 2:3); and (3) that the range of explosibility at maximum dilution
in an engine is 50 per cent of that with minimum dilution/ 2 it results that at a density of 0.035
pound per cubic foot, and 0.1 load, the mixture ratio should have a value of approximately
15.5 for maximum economy.
Since the compression pressures at 0.1 load are nearly the same at all air densities, and
since the same is true of the dilutions and temperatures, it can be taken that the optimum
mixture ratio (that of maximum economy) approaches that of maximum power, at all
densi Lies, as the tIu'ottle is closed to the idling position .
In final consideration of plot 21, it should be noted that while at ground level 0.1 the
maximum air corresponds very approximately to ielling of the engine, the relative loading at
idling increases as the density is reduced, since almost a much power is required to turn tho
motor over at mall den ities as at large. TIm, at reduced den. ities it is impossible to reduce
the relative air to its idling value at the ground, without stalling the engine-unless its revolution is assisted by the reaction of the propellor, as in descending flight. It appears that the
lelative air for idling at 0.035 density, plot 21, i very approx.imately 0.4. In any case, thi
latter consideration has no bearing on the foregoing as a study of ~he carburetion. requirements.
NATURAL LOAD COMPENSATION.

The load compensations of the several carburetors are interesting, in that they are expressions of individual preferment in metering method and structure, and of the compromi e
that have heen included in each device, by choice or otherwi e.
In the case of the elemental carburetor, comprising a constricted air passage having a
fuel passage discharging at its throat, the load compensation is fundamentally perfect (clisregarding the requirements of the engine), in that a constant ratio between the weights of air
and of fuel will be maintained, if the coefficient of discharge for the ail' and the fuel passages
heal' a fixed reln.tionship to each other.ls In practice there are several almost unavoidable
circumstances which modify this simple ca e, and there are those discussed conditions of requirement which make a constant weight relationship undesirable.
In the main, the load compensation of carburetor A, plot 15, follows that of the simple
case above. But here w is made approximately proportional to W, not by selection of passage
having a constant ratio of coefficients, but by utilizing the sum of the di charges of two nozzle
operating under dissimilar conditions. It is arranged, through separate mean operating only
at the smallest air flows, to atisfy the requirement for an enriched mixture with reduced
relative air flow.
From the diagram of carburetor B (fig. 8), it appears that throttle manipulation controls
the air charge weight by modification of the density of the air stream, as well as by modification
of its .velocity. Tlus is a condition not contemplated in the simple case, in that V is no longer
only proportional to W at a given atmospheric density. The result in the relative performance
of carburetor n is that the fuel discharge reduces loss rapidly than the air weight during throttle
closure, since the velocity of the air stream is less reduced for a given change in charge weight.
The load compensation, neglecting the control exercised hy the nozzle air passage, is identical
12 This assumption is quite generally supported by observation of permissible mLxture ratio variation for steady operation, at idling and at
open throttlo.
11 At any air density W yaries directly as V; and w is proportional to .J'h or to .Jp-p, where 1', is the throat pressure. But within the desiraole range of values in a carburetor, .J1'-P, is also directly as V. Hence w varies directly as '''.

with the natural altimetric compensation discu sed in the foregoing for the theoretical case,
and found to exist in a conventional carburetor structure.
It seems that the load compensation of carburetor C has been developed with regard for
the requirements of service, in so far as they are known. The mixture ratio reduces almost
directly with the load. This results from the nozz.le structure in whieh decreasing heads across
the nozzle outlet cause Ie s arr to be admitted to modify the metering head, both by virtue of
the change in pre sure difference and by virtue of a change in the eifect-iYe area of the ail' ports.
This carburetor represents the simplo case, with a uperimposed empirical metering characteristic, and fitted in addition with separate means for arbitrarily modifying thc relative fuel
discharge at the smallest air flows.
CONCLUSIONS.

With respect to engine requirements, it may be said that the de!':irable meteIing characteristics which a carburetor should ha"l·e can not be :f:L'Ced absolutely, being dependent upon
type of se1""l-ice requirement. The following stu tement are giycn as the best available hypotheses upon which to base carburetor design, in the light of our present kno,dedge.
(1) The mixture ratio for development of maximum power is approximately constant (at
about 15 air/fuel for gasolines) at all relative loads and at all air densities.
(2) The mixtme ratio for the development of maximum economy at full load become
smaller a.s the atmospheric density is reduced.
(3) The mixture ratio for the de,elopment of maximum economy at part load hecome
smaller as the load is reduced by tlu-ottling.
(4) The mixtme ratio of maximum economy becomes more nearly equal to thaL giying
maximum po",-er as the output and as the atmospheric density are reduced.
With respect to the carburetor proper, it is concluded that:
(5) The ordinarily employed variations in tructure and in method of fuel control, in
carburetors re embling the simple elemental type, effect inappreciable modifications of the
altimetric compensation, being subject to tbe same considerable rate of enrichment \\-"".ith re•
duced atmospheric density.
(6) Ordinarily employed variations in carburet.or structure and in method of fu<:'l control
result in widely different characteristic changes in mixture ratio as the load is changed by
throttle manipulation.

The following report i a di cussion of ways and means of correcting the eJll'ichment of the

above the earth' surface. Possible contr ol methods are de cribed and discussed in the J;ght

for and the possibilities of an au tomatic mechanical regul ation of the control device.
I t i concluded that (1) anyone of several con tr ol methods will be equally effective; (2)
automatic regulation of the control is, in gener al, mor e de irable than manual regulation ; and
(3) it is possible to regulate the con trol au tomatically to give a compl ete correction of the
mi.xture at all altitudes.
CONTROL OF ALTIMETR£C CHARACTERISTICS.

Considering the de irable mixture ratio variation dictated by engine requirements, it is
evident that some form of con trol must be incorporated in a carburetor approximating the
simple type,2 to permit it to serve th e engine properly over a range of atmo pheric densitie .
The natural characteristic in a carburetor is that of too rapid increase in the relative fuel content
of the mixture, as the atmo pheric density is reduced. I-l ence t.he altimetric control under
discussion is one that permits of modifying th e natural air to fu el r elation hip in ap inverse
manner to the changes in atmospheric density. Th e following is offered in discussion of means
for the accomplishment of th is control.
The possible methods all involve a modification of the relative amount of fuel upplied,
ince appreciable change in the weight of air taken is impracticable. The e method
divide into two classe , as follow : (1) Control of the ar ea .01' th e fuel metering pas age; and
(2) control of the pressure difference or head across that pa sage. Of the two, the latter class
is that almost always employed, because it i less sensitive in adjustment and develbps into ft
simpler and Ie s delicate structure, m ore in accord ance with the accep ted general aims in Carburetor design.
In class (2) we have subclasses wher e the pressure difference is modified by «(1,) control of
the float chamber pressure and (b) control of the nozzle ou tlet pre sure. Of these, the former
at this time enjoys the O'reater vogue wi th carburetor de igners, although , a will be shown, the
latter is capable of useful and simple developmen t .
If, as is usual, the altimetric con trol i designed with pecial refer ence to the open throttle
condition, it does not neces arily, in its open throttle setting, cau e the engine to be supplied
with a desirnble mixture when the th rottle is par tially closed. In such a case, the control

Each of the foregoing methods has been applied to aircraft service, usually under direct,
manual regulation; and each can be fully adequate when suitably proportioned and controlled. There is thus no question of relative effectivenes. On the other hand, the structural
differences are considerable, and there is room for election of method, considering simplicity,
ease of production, and reliability through obviation of possible irregularities. This last point.
reliability, as, umes its greate t importance when it is attempted to substitute automatic regulation for the more u ual hand control.
EFFECT OF THROTTLE POSITION 0

ALTIMETRIC COMPEN Al'IOX.

Considering the altimetric control as having been properly ot at any altitude, under open
throt,tle, it is important to examine what happens to the mixture ratio a the throttle is clo ed.
Complete altimetric correction involves a ll..'\.ecl percentage reduction ill the fuel flows, compared with tho e occurring at the ground, for all relative loadings.
Having regard for clas (1), it is obvious that having made a correct adjustmellt of the
fuel metering area at any onf( loading, a change in air flow will leave the relationship with
ground ratios undistmbed, provided the change in area has not altered the coefficient of eli'charge of the passage. It can hardly be hoped to accomplish thi. last with any ordinary or
simple form of adju ting structure; and this, together with the extreme ::ien itiveness of the
method, has resulted in its narrow use.
In the type of cla s (2a) controlling the flo at-chamber pressure, the ::iubatmospheric connection must of nece sity enter the air passaae of the carburetor as shown in figure l. But
the pres mes in the adjutage of the till'oat do not bear a constant relation to that of the atmo phero with change in air flow .3 Thi r esults in change in the fioat-chamber pressure under
tlu'ottle manipulation with anyone setting of the control. Admiliting that the ground load
compensation is correct with the control in the off po ition, it appears that a varying floatchamber pressure, as at an altitude, will prevent its duplication, since it will change the order
of variation of the metering head with change in relative load. The change in adjutage pressure with load is such a to ause a material enrichment of the mixture a the throttling is
increa ed. In clas (2a), then, the altimetric control must be 'hifted \"it1l the tlu-ottle.
Passing to cIa s (2b), with regulation of the effective throat area (case A, fig. 2), the pre su re
along the axis in the entrance of the movable tube will be in constant ratio with that in the
till'oat at all densitie. A a result, the ground load compensation will be duplicated at any
altitude "vith a single etting of the altimetric control.
Likewise, in case B of figure 2, the ame result is accomplislled if the coefl'cient of discharge across the auxiliary port, at auy et opening, varies directly with that of the main
tIu'oat pa sage a the air flow change . Thi' latter condition can be almost fully realized with
suitable design of the auxiliary passage.
At all except the smallest air fiow , the control method at 0, figUl'e 2, will permit of maintenance of the ground load compensation at any altitude, on a fixeel setting of the control,
since the pre sure at the throat at any relative uir flow bears a constaDt relation hip to that
of the atmo phere. At the mallest air flows at altitudes, th mixture will be richer in fuel
than at corre poneling ground flow by an amount depending upon the height of the nozzle
member abo,e the point of entry of the air stream . Tlli " enrichment will be greater the greater
the altitude.

A further point wllich can not be wholly neglected is the eIrect of the altimetric control
upon the fineness of division of the fuel, tru:ough alt,eratious of the magnitudes of the forceR
causing ·praying. Of the methods di 'cussed, tho e at A and B, figure 2, are the only ones in
which URe of the control reduce the energy available for spraying. The method at 0, figure 2.

CRITICISM OF CO J'l'ROL STRUCTURE.

Structurally, the methods involving a small plug valve controlling an air stream (fig. 1,
and 0, fig. 2) are the simplest and most easily produced. Also their regulation is comparatively
direct and involves small forces and a minimum of parts. For such rea ons, these methods are
the ones almost always encountered in e.cvice. On the other hand, each requires special
manipulation to cover the complete throttling range mos.t advantageously.
The method at A, figure 2, possesses the structural disadvantages attendant. upon controlled motion of one of the carburetor's maj or organs. The parts must be made to move
freely, and auxiliary members must be included to nullify the effect of l ack of balance in the
forces to which the controlled member i ubjected. This further complicates the structure
and makes reliability of performance more difficult to attain, particularly when only small
displacing forces are available.
On the above scores, the method at B, figure 2, is superior to that at A, in that unbalance
is easily eliminated by mounting two valves on a single tem, and causing one to open inward ly
as the other opens outwardly. This gives the desired result without material complication
and with no additional working parts.
A possible disadvantage in thls method is the size of the auxiliary air port that must be
provided. At an atmo pheric pressure equal to one-half that at the ground (Px/Po = 0.5) the
uncontrolled or natural mixture will contain 1.415 times the desired amount of fuel. That is
to say, the metering head is twice as great as it should be to maintain equality of the mixture
ratio with that at the ground. From this it results that one-half the air taken by the engine
will be required to pass the auxiliary port under thls condition of atmospheric pressure. But
since the coeffieierit of discharge for a passage such as the auxiliary must be, is only about
0.75 that for a carburetor-throat tube, the arell, of the auxiliary port must be 0.5/0.75 =0.66
of the total passage area through the carburetor, or approximately 1.5 times that of the carburetor throat.
The most serious aspect of unbalanced forces upon the controlled member, or of complicated actuating mechanism, is faced when it is attempted to regulate by automatic means.
Here a definite displacement must follow the application of a definite but small force applied
by the regulator. But where automatic regulation is employed, it is clearly e sential that tho
load compensation be unaffected, 01' negligibly affected, by the position of the controlled member.
As previously stated, method B, figure 2, is one of the few with which this result is possible.
For the best results throughout a flight, the setting of the altimetric control must be
changed in a very definite manner. Thus, automatic regulation of the control will be highly
desirable if it can be made to follow,faithfully the changes in the surrounding conditions.
Consideration of the relative merits of manual and automatic regulation leads to the
conclusion that the latter i the more desirable, €Iven though it does not follow the conditions
with absolute faithfulness. This follows from the natural limitations of the manual method
qf regulation. Here chief reliance must be placed in the indications of the engine tachometer
and in the senses of the pilot. This is all very well within certain narrow limits. But under
present day surroundings of the pilot it is too much to expect his senses of sound and touch
to be of great assistance, even if he has unlimited time in which to act upon their indications .
. Clearly, also, the engine tachometer as an indicator on the altimetric control leaves much to
be desired in attempting a setting for maximum economy. This latter is never attained at
maximum R. P. M. on a given throttle opening, and neither is it attained with the poorest
mixture that will operate the engine steadily.·
AUTOMATIC OPERATIO,

OF ALTIMETRIC CONTROLS

Automatic means that can be made to follow both pressure and temperature changes is
not far to seek. A sealed flexible-walled chamber will expand under reduced pressure in its
surroundings. Also, it will expand under increased temperature. Since the direction of the

required change in the setting of the altimetric control is the same under reduced pressure
and under temperature increase, it only remains to design the regulator for deflections to fit
the requirementss. Strictly speaking, automatic regulation of this kind can only be applied
to a method of control which does not disturb the compensation under throttle.
A representative flexible or extensible chamber, on which to base a discussion, consists
of a pair of rigid, circular end pieces between which is sealed a cylindrical metal bellows.
Assuming the bellows to contain dry air and to have been sealed at absolute pressure P, and
absolute temperature T, equal to those at ground level or zero altitude, the volume of the
bellows at an altitude x is V x = Vo

Substituting the length, L , for the volume, since it

tain the same measure of correction.
In the case where the carburetor air is at constant temperature, the deflection of the control
regulator is proportional to the square of the required orifice area correction; and is directly
proportional to the required correction in metering head. In the former case, it will be necessary to contour the fuel orifice, or to control its area through some intermediate device, as a
cam. In the latter it mayor may not be required to use contoured control parts, depending
upon the method of control chosen. The methods at A and B, figure 2, lend themselves to
operation with only the interpo ition of direct linkage between the control member and its
regulator.
.
If the carburetor air temperature varies, it is obviou in both cases that the deflection of
the regulator will be relatively too little, considering the temperature correction, if it is suitably
transmitted and utilized with respect to the pressure changes.
But it is possible in a bellows type regulator to make the change in length virtually independent of one or the other of these changes in its surroundings. If the inclosure is completely
exhausted at the time of sealing, its length will be unaffected by temperature changes. In
order that it may respond to changes in pressure, it is only necessary to inclose within the
bellows a spring reacting wjth sufficient Jorce to prevent the maximum external pressure to
which it is subjected from closing it up completely.
Likewise, such a chamber, completely filled with a liquid, will be negligibly affected as to
length by a change in pressure, but will respond to changes in temperature.
Thus, by one of several possible mechanical interconnections or assemblies of units, as
in the diagrams of figure 3, it can be brought about that the automatic regulation of the control
will be complete. In final consideration of control regulation it may be stated that if the
carburetor air temperature varies through comparatively narrow limits, a ' single air-:filled
expansible regulating member may give a sufficiently close approximation for most practical
purposes.
CONCLUSIONS:

(1) Several control methods may be equally effective.
(2) Automatic regulation of the control is, in general, more desirable than manual regulation.
(3) It is possible to regulate the control automatically to give complete correction of the
mixture at all altitudes.
