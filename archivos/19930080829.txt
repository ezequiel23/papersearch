It has been ShO 'NIl by measurements previously , aken of
t
model balloons, ** that comparat ively sl ight al tel.'at iona in
surface may have considerable effect upon the resistance of
a body.

Reference need only be reade to the very striking

results obtained by those tests as regards the resistance of
a model balloon covered with fabric.

The raised threads of

the fabric ha',ing been scorched with flame, the resistance
of the oalloon more than doubled in value, contrary to any
procedure hitherto observed, when the REYNOL!)S

sy~bol

in-·

creased frorr. about 100000 to 250000.
In testino struts, similar observatj,ons have been made
and are briefly reported as

*** The first series of measurements was made durlng the War on
behalf of the Deu~schen Flugzeugwerke, Leipzic. The strking nature of the results obtained led to further measurements being taken in a second series of tests carried out
at the Laboratory.

not perfectly smooth after this treatrrent, being slightly
rough owing to the thread.s and raised fioere of the fabric.
The results of the me asurements of the surface of such nature are snown oy the dotted li!1e e of the curves plotted in
Figs. 2 to 8, (PI.B.18 ) the resistance being given in terms
of the chal'ac"teristic value.

It is astonishing to :find that

the resistance increases again , after first diminishing
with the decrease of characteristic value, to more than double the quantity of t he lowest resis t ance in many cases, as,
for instance, in struts

3

and

7.

The decrease that takes

place at the outlet corresponds to the passage through the
region of critical velocity. as has be en previously pbserved
in the case of spheres and bodies of other shapes.

The fact

of there being little or no rising tendency on the part of
struts

4 and 5

may be due to the accidental presence of

less roughness in the fabriC.
The surface was then alt e red by the removal of any roughness on it by means of fi l ing w
ith sandpaper.

The measure-

ments of surfaces thus treat e d gave values represented by
the extended lines.

The increase of resistance vnth increas-

ing characteristic varue, more or less marked in the first
series of measurements, was no longer observable.

Resistance

always decreases with the increase of characteristic value
excepting in the case of strut

dency to rise again.

The reasons for this phenomenon have not yet been fully
explained.

treatment of the preceding matter

p~ssible.

The

va~iatioj

cf yesistance de-

.

pends, as is well known, upon the change of position of the.
point of separation of the air filaments, which is, agaj. n ,
in close relation to the turbulency conditions of the s epa rating air layer.

When "there is a turbuler!t separating a?r

layer, bodies of the shape in question usually offer less resistance than in the case of a lamina surface of sep arat icn.
The . factors that come into play in the renewed resistance
should therefore be thoroughly investigated.
It may be as Rell to ffiention the low absolute value of
that resistance, which decreases, under the most favorable
Circumstances, to Cw = 5

in the case of strut
