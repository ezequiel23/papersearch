2 . - BALANCE - We used the balance previously used
by M. Laurain in his experiment s on spheres (see Bulletin
of the St Cyr I . A.T . - No. II) .

It consists of a vertical

frame of steel "!;uting, oscillating on two knife-ed6 es fixed
t a a wooden stand. .

The whol e device is very light and very sensitive (sensitiveness 0 . 5 gramme) .

The spheres to be t este d are weld-

ed to a steel wire 1 rr.m . in diameter whicf can be hooked
on the

fra~e

of the balance .

A tur nbuc kle is use d for giv-

ing the required rigidity to the supporting wire .

The wire

enters and leaves the experimental cL-.lamber by two longitudinal slots 2

~n .

Wide and 30 mn . long .

These slots allow

the wire to oscillate freely, but :;11ey also let in air .
The resulJ.j j,ng perturbat ion is taken into o.ccount, as stated
be l o\7) by ga uging the resistance of the supporting wire by
direct measuremer.t .
REMARK -

The advisabil i ty of construoting an enclo sed

space t o include that part of the t',mnel containine?; the
working

sectio~,

has been considered.

If

tha~

were done ,

the outside pressu.re w'ould be in equiliorium with the pressure inside the

t~nnel ,

and thus the inlet of air through

the slots would be avoided.

by the static pressure opening , we have the relation:

This rela·~ion holds good even when the spheres being
tested are interposed in the airstream .

- 5 REN~RK

I. - In our early experiments we measured the

velocity of the airstream direct with the Pitot tube, but
we had to give up this method because the perturbation
caused in tl:e stream, especially at high velocities, by the
Pitot tube placed forward of the sphere reacted on it and
distorted the measurements.
REMARK II. - For calculating the velocity by the rela-tion:

the pressure

H must be taken equal to the actual pressure

of the airs'bre am in movement.

For a surrounding barometri-

cal pressure equal to Ho ' the pressure

PREVIOUS lEASUREMEIT OF: rHE RF2IST!NCE . OF THE

SUPPORTING WIRE - We have measured for different speeds
the resistance of the supporting wire placed, without sphere,
in the experimental chamber .
The coefficient
ments varies slightly.

K = s~

calculated by these measure-

Its mean value is

K = 0.063, a

figure near to those fcund by .:1. Eiffel for the resistance
of wires.
To deduce t:l e re sista:ace of the sphere it self from the
measurement made ivi t~ the sphere and it s support ing wire,
we have taken into account that part of the wire subjected

,

to the action of the airstream outside of the sphere .

It will be not iced that there is a notable disagree m'3nt be-c ',vee;). our e::per i1.18nt s ar..d prev i ous expe, r iment s, on
the following point s :
1st .

The coefficient

K before the critical speed is

reached has been found notably higher in our experiments .
T~e prod~ct

2nd .

VR for

variation of the coefficient

whic~

K

is produced the rapid

is a l so r£luch l arger in our

experiments .
3r d .

The value of the coefficient

K after the crit -

i c al speed is greater in our experiments than in those of
M. Ej,ffel and :1. M
.aurain , but smaller than in Loukiannof's
experiment s .

Only Captain C03tanz i' s

e~~peri;nent s

on the

44 . 4 mm . sphere are in partial agreement with outs, at least
so far as regards the high value of the coefficient

K be -

fore the critical speed .
DISCUSSION. - On the w~ole, we see that the different
experimenters are far frol1l agreeing \1ith each other .

Only

the experiments of ~. Maurain and M. Eiffel give results
fairly analogous both as to the absolute value of
the course of the variations of
lL

K with

K and

VR .

Eifiel's experiments were made in a tunne l with a

diameter of 2. 00 m. with an airstream not bounded by mater ial walls .

Maurain I s experiment s were ;'t.ade i n a wind tunnel

with a SUCTION fl~e .

,

The air dravm in escapes into the sur-

rounding atnosphere, and

~t

the place imere the spheres are

being tested it is :lot limited by material walls.
Is the a.greement be t ween the se two experimenters due
to this cil'cumstance of the absence of material vtralls?
M. Loukiannof opera".:;ed in a tunnel 1.00 m. in diameter w7th material walls, but it is to be feared that , for
the sphere of 240 rom ., the walls
fluence.

exercisec~

a notable i:l-

On the other hand, for the spheres of 56 mm. and

118 mm. he worked under the same conditions as M. Eiffel
for his spheres of 160 and 240 mm.

There is, however, a

notable discrepancy between the r esul ts of M. Loukiarillof
and those of Eiffel and Maurain, especialJy after -che critical speed.
As regards our own results, we consider that the sole
objection of the action of the walls is not sufficient to
account altogether for the disagreement with the results of
other experimenters.

For the spheres of 19.8, 28.5, and

39 . 2 rom. the dimension of the tunnel (300 rom.) is in the
same ratio as that of the Eiffel tunnel with the s:pheres of
160 and

24~

mm.; even the sphere of 50.5 mm. is admissible

by the same right as the sphere of 330 mm. in the Eiffel
tunnel.
We are thus unable to explain, for the moment, the cause
of these discrepancies.

We con s ider that the question should

be taken up again v ery methodically, defining clearly all the
experimental conditions and utilizing various dimensions of
tunnel for the same spheres .
