EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF INHERENT LONGITUDINAL
STABILITY FOR A TYPICAL BIPLANE.
By

JEROME

HUNSAKER.

ARTICLE

1.

INTRODUCTION.

A model of span 18 inches, representing a typical military tractor
biplane, was tested in the wind tunnel of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. The lift, drift, and pitching moment were measured
for a series of angles of incidence corresponding to the maximum
possible changes of flight attitude. Only the discussion of symmetrical or longitudinal changes is given here. A report on the
lateral stability of the same model is reserved for a later date. From
the observed rate of variation of the forces and pitching moment, it
was possible to calcula.te the "derivatives" needed in the complete
theory of longitudinal stability in still air. The damping of the
pitchrng oscillation waS also determined experimentally.
The method followed is that of L. Bairstow in his extension of
Bryan's theory. Notation also follows Bairstow. The value of
Routh's discriminant, which Bryan has shown to be a measure of
dynamical longitudinal stability, has been calculated for six speeds,
ranging from the maximum to the minimum possible speeds for the
aero:(>lane type selected. The principal point of interest brought
out rn this connection is that stability falls off rapidly as speed
decreases or angle of attack increases, and that while this aeroplane
appears to be very stable at high speeds, it is frankly unstable at
speeds below 47 miles per hour.
This ins~ability at low speeds takes the form of an oscillation in
pitch combined with changing in forward speed and a rising and
sinking of the whole aeroplane, which, therefore, follows an undulatory
flight path. The period of the undulation is about 12 seconds, and
the amplitude doubles itself in less than 20 seconds. Obviously, the
pilot can not safely abandon his controls at slow speed.
The importance of this demonstrated instability at low speeds
should be appreciated in view of recent accidents with military
aeroplanes when operated at slow speeds.
The entire investigation of inherent longitudinal stability was preliminary to the di cussion of the effect of wind gusts. Naturally, it
was first necessary to find a stable aeroplane and to obtain some idea
25

of the "range" of stability. I t now appears that a typical aeroplane
is inherently stable in the sense defiried a t high speeds only . The
effect of gusts on the uncontrolled aeroplane will, therefore, be
investigated only for the high-speed condition. At low speeds the
aeroplane can not be left to itself in still air. Consequently, a disCUSSIon of its certain destruction if abando.ned in gusty air appears
unprofitable.

MODEL AND PROTOTYPE.

The type of aeroplane selected is a high-speed military biplane
tractor known as Ourtiss J N2 . Shop plans of this aeroplane were
kindly furnished by t he Curtiss Aeroplane Co., Buffalo, N . Y., to
whom acknowledgment must be made for much valuable assistance,
including the experimental determination of moments of inertia, etc.,
by Dr. A. F. Zahm of that company.

The model was made geometrically similar to its prototype and
one twenty-fourth scale. The general features are shown in the
drawincrs of the model. (Figs. 1 a, b, c.) The model was an exact
copy of the aeroplane except for the propeller and wing wiring,
which features were omitted. Also wing struts were made round
instead of "stream-line" in section. Since it is well known that
the resistance of a series of similar aeroplanes varies somewhat less
rapidly than the square of the speed and square of a linear dimension, due to skin friction, it is believed that the prediction of the
resistance of the full size aeroplane from the observed model resistance
will still be a fair estimate in spite of omissions on the model.
For simplicity, the model was made with the trailing ailerons or
wing flaps integral with the wings. This somewhat increases the
effective supporting area. Also the fixed tail and elevator were
made in one, corresponding to the elevator held fast in its neutral
position. These points are made clear on the drawings of the model.

Report of the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, London, 1912-13,
for detail description and methods of operation.
In general, it may be stated that the wind tunnel provides a wind
constant in velocity within 1 per cent, which velocity is further constant across the working cross section of the tunnel within Ii per
cent. Velocity is measured by a suction plate calibrated against a
standard Pitot tube with a precision of one-half per cent. The
model is mounted on the balance in various attitudes of pitch or yaw,
and in such positions are measured the three forces and three couples
produced by che wind along and about three mutually perpendicular
axes in space. From a lmowledge of the variation of the e forces and
couples with change of atti tude, the so-called " resistance derivatives "
of Bryan's 1 theory of dynamical stability may be computed.
The theory of stability also requires the determination of the damping of oscillations about the center of gravity of the aeroplane. A
special oscillating apparatus was built for these tests which will be
described below. By oscillatinO' the model in the wind and observing
the decrement of amplitude wit);. time, it was possible to estimate the
"rotary derivatives.'

LONGITUDINAL TESTS.

The model was mounted on the balance with its wings in a vertical
plane by means of a vertical rod driven into the body at the point
shown on :figure lb. By swinging the model about the vertical axis
passing through the spindle, tlie angle of wind to the wing chord was
varied from+200 to _8°. At each attitude the force across the wind
or " Lift," force down wind or "Drift," and the pitching moment
about the spindle were measured. The signs were taken so that
an actual lift, actual head re istance, and a stalling moment are positive. The wind velocity was 30 miles per hour of standard dry air
at 15° C. and 776 mm. Hg. The experunental points are shown on
:figure 2, where forces are in pounds and moments in inch-pounds.
The precision of measurement is within 1 per cent.
For a given attitude, the resultant force on the model in pounds
at 30 miles per hour is R = -JD + D2. This resultant make an
angle with the wind direction given by a = tan -1 ~. The force R
is observed to have a pitching moment M about' the spindle axis.
It may then be assumed to be situated so that the perpendicular
from this axis to R is given by X= -:. The vector R is thus determined in magnitude, direction, and line of application. The resultant
force vectors R are shown on :figure 1b to a scale 1 inch equals 0.2
pound. The vector R is purely an algebraic substitution for the
complicated system of forces and coupIes acting on the aeroplane.
The vectors are drawn relative to the aeroplane.
The center of gravity was assumed to lie as shown near the intersection of the propeller axis with the resultant force vector for 4°.
At this attitude, then, the pitching moment should be nearly zero.

when V is the flying speed of the aeroplane in miles per hour. The
above relation holds, of course, only for the same attitude of model
and aeroplane, The weight of the aeroplane, 1,800 pounds, must
equal the lift in flight. Hence:

V= 30 /

A series of speeds V was computed for a series of attitudes of the
aeroplane, and the aeroplane drift at each attitude was then computed from:

(V)2

D full size = D model x 24 x 30

In figure 3 are given curves of drift, effective horsepower required,
angle of wing chord to wind and ratio weight to drift plotted on Vas
abscissae. For our calculations a maximum speed of 79 miles and a
minimum of 43 .7 miles were selected corresponding to angles of wing
chord to wind of 1 ° and 15.5°, respectively.
The curve of E.H.P. on figure 3, indicates that 87 propeller horsepower is necessary for a speed of 79 miles. If the propeller h as an
efficiency of 80 per cent, the motor must develop at least 110 brake
horsepower. The original designs contemplated as maximum speed
of about 80 miles per hour for a 120 brake horsepower motor, which
appears very reasonable. As actually built this type was given a
rated 90 horsepower motor. Assuming 70 E.H.P. delivered to the
propeller a speed of 73 miles per hour is indicated by our curves. It
is r eported that the speed of this aeroplane was actually 73 miles per
hour.
ARTICLE 6.
CHOICE OF AXES-NOTATION- UNITS.

Axes for reference are assumed fixed in the aeroplane and moving
with it in space. The origin is at the center of o-ravity. For steady
horizontal flight at a given attitude the axis of Z is vertical, the axis
of X Horizontal and directed to the rear in the plane of symmetry,
and the axis of Y is horizontal and directed toward the left-wing tip.
Forces along these axes are denoted by X, Y, Z and are expressed In
pounds per unit mass. Moments are L, M, N and are given in poundsfeet per unit mass.1
Angles of roll, pitch and yaw from the normal flying attitude are
denoted by 'P, e and 1/;. Angular velocities of roll, pitcli and yaw are
p, 9., rin radius per second. The signs of moments, angles and angular
velocity are positive considered in the directions XY, YZ or lx.
Moments of inertia referred to axes X, Y, Z are denoted by
mK2A, mK2B, mK20 where m is the mass of the aeroplane and ~,
KB, Ko corresponding radii of gyration.

EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS.

In n ormal horizontal flight in still air a state of equilibrium is
assumed such that the power available maintains the aeroplane at
such a speed that the weight is just sustained. Since the lift of an
aeroplane wing is also a function of its attitude or angle of attack,
it is further assumed that the attitude is proper for the speed. In

normal horizontal flight the axis of X is parallel to the apparent wind
direction and is hence horizontal. Let {) be the angle of pitch of the
aeroplane away from its normal attitude. Then normally (J is zero.
Likewise if the aeroplane is in equilibrium ill its flight, the angular
velocity of pitch is zero and also the pitching moment, Mo.
At high speed, for example 79 miles, the aXlS of X is horizontal and
makes an angle of 1 0 with the wing chord. At low speed, new axes
are chosen such that the axis of X is still horizontal but makes an
angle of 15.5 0 with the wing chord. The axes are fixed by the
equilibrium conditions for flight and differ for each normal flying
attitude. Oscillations about the normal flight path when the motion
is disturbed are referred to the above defined axes which are assumed
fixed in the aeroplane and moving with it in space.
The pitching moment curve observed for the model shows zero
moment for an angle of wing chord of 4.5 0 and a diving moment at
larger angles. For slow flight, it is assumed that the pilot by proper
setting of his horizontal rudder impresses an equal stalling moment
on the machine so that the net pitching moment is zero. The effect
is to move the pitching moment curve parallel to itself by the algebraic addition of a stalling moment so that its ordinate h as zero value
for the desired flight attitude.

TRANSFORMATION OF AXES.

It is convenient to measure in the wind tunnel the lift and drift
about axes always vertical and horizontal in space. For the oscillations of the aeroplane it is convonient to consider the forces referred
to axes fixed in the aeroplane as described above. The transformation is effected in the usual way by means of the formulre:
m Z' =L cos 8+D sin 8 ,

m X' =D cos 8-L sin 8 ,

wher e e is the angle of pitch of the aeroplane awll.Y from its normal
attitude, considered positive for stalling angles. H ere Land Dare
lift and ill'ift on the model in pounds, and m X ' and m Z' corresponding forces in pounds along the axes X and Z. The model forces
Z', X' are converted t o Z , X, full size, by multiplying by the
square of the speed and linear dimension ratios. The following tables
carry out the r equired transformation.
The pitching moment M is independent of the longitudinal shift of
axes and varies onlyas the square of the speed. Curves of X, Z and M
for the differ ent flight attitudes are plotted on figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
and 9. The transformation of the moment about the spindle to the
corresponding moment about the c. g. of the full-size aeroplane is
given b elow.

RESISTANCE DERIVATIVES, LONGITUDINAL.

Notation follows Bairstow,t to whose papt'!' reference should be
made for the det ailed discussion of " derivatives." In the theory of
small oscillations, the aerodynamic forces X o, Zo, and pitching
moment, M o , are eliminated by the conditions of equilibrium. In
disturbed motion, disturbances in normal flying speed and attitude
oause changes in the quantities, X, Z, and M .
L et V be the normal flying speed and u , wand q small changes in
horizontal and vertical velocIty components and angular velocity of
pitch. If the disturbance be smail, u, wand q are small with respect
to U. For example, the function
X =j(V+u, w, q)
may be expanded into the approximate form
X =Xo+ uXu+wXw+qWq ,
a linear lunetion of the small quantities u, w, q. The coefficients
Xu. X WJ Xq are the so-called resistance derivatives of the theory of

Similar formulas are used to compute Zw and Mw . It may be noted
that the method assumes that for small oscillations, hence small
changes 0, the tangent may be substituted for the actual curve.
The limit of validity is obviously the range of pitch angle over which
the tangent to the curve is not greatly changed. This range is usually
about 4 to 8 degrees.
The values of the resistance derivatives calculated in this manner

RADIUS OF GYRATION.

For the radii of gyration of the fully loaded aeroplane we are indebted to Dr. A. F . Zahm. The actual aeroplane, complete with
gasoline, water, pilot, passenger, and other weights in place, was
suspended from a beam by a chain. The center of gravity was first
located by an inclining method. The machine was then made to
oscillate in pitch about the point of attachment of the upper end of
the chain. Light guys were run to tail and wing tips to insure that
the chain and aeroplane moved as a rigid body.
Let the distance from center of gravity to point of susp ension be
denoted b:v h, p the natural period of oscillation in seconds, KB the
radius of gyratIOn in feet about the Y axis or a.-us of pitch, then

By observation h = 12.2 feet, p = 60/14 seconds.

ROUTH'S DISCRIMINANT.

Bryan 2 has shown that the character of the longitudinal motion
of an aeroplane may be investigated with reference to the roots of
a biquadratic equatIOn of the form:
A A' + BAS+ OA2 + DA + E = 0

The equations of motion may be considered of the form 8 = Ke'Al
where K is some constant. F or stability tbe quantity A must be
negative if real, or have its real part negative if complex, in order
that the amplitude of the motion will dlillinish with time.
Th./3 conditIOn that the real roots and real parts of imaginary roots
of a biquadratic eguation with constant coefficients shall be negative
is that the coeffiCIents A, B, 0, D, E shall each be positive as well
as the quantity BOD- A D2_ B2E. The latter is commonly known
as Routh's 3 discriminant .
The constant coefficients A, B, 0, D, E, are functions of the C011~tants of the aeroplane at the normal fi~g attitude, i. ~., the followmg: X1/" X w, X q, Z1/" Zw, Zq, ~, Mw, .Mq, U, and KB • These are
resistance and rotary derivatives, velocity, and radius of gyration.
For a given attitude and for small oscillations about that attitude,
it is considered that these quantities are constant. For simplicity
it is here assumed that normal flight takes place in a horizontal plane
and the inclination of the fli$ht path and consequent components of
gravity in the axes of X and. Z are eliminated. Also Xq and Zq are
it is of interest to note that the radius of gyration for rolling was estinlated to be 6.2 feet .

BAIRSTOW'S APPROXIMATE SOLUTION.

From consideration of the usual relative numerical values of the
coefficients of the biquadratic, Bairstow has shown that the equation
may be factored to a first approximation and put into the following
form :

in which the :first factor represents a very short oscillation, which
in most aeroplanes rapidly aies out and is of no importance. The
second factor represents a relatively long oscillation involving an
undulatory flight path with changes in pitch, forward speed, and
altitude. The long oscillations should diminish in amplitude with
time) in which case the motion is stable and the aeroplane will return
to its original normal flight attitude if temporarily deviated therefrom by accidental cause. The motion is unstable if the long oscillation increases in amplitude with time. It will be shown that the
aeroplane under investigation is stable at high speeds and unstable
at very low speeds. It is believed that this is true of all aeroplanes.

VARIATION OF LONGITUDINAL STABILITY WITH SPEED.

Preliminary to consideration of the action of gusts on an inherently
stable aeroplane, it was desired to analyze the motion in still air of a
machine which could be called inherently stable longitudinally. It
has been found above that a typical aeroplane becomes Ie s stable
at low speeds until real instability results. This re ult is somewhat
unexpeoted in view of the curves of pitching moment JJ1, which indicated static stability at all possible attitudes up to and inoluding
horizontal flight at + 15°.5. In other words, JJ1w is positive for all
cases. The instability comes about on acoount of the rapid rate of
increase of drift at large angles causing Xw to change sign, and on
account of the les rapid rate of increase of lift, causing ZtO to become small at high angles of pitch. Furthermore, JJ1q dimi nishes at
low speed.
From the speed power curves on figure 3, it appears that for angles
greater than 10°, we are on the part of the power curve which requires more power to go slower, "region of reversed oontrols." This
region is now found to be dynamically unstable so that controlled
flight only is possible here. But WIth reversed controls this is
doubly dangerous.
The frequency of accidents at low speeds, following the recent
demand for a wide speed range, con:.fiTms this impression of the
danger of low speeds when approaching a critical angle and speed.
The critical angle for instability is clearly an angle less than the possible maximum for flight.
A fair measure of the relative stability at various speeds may be
had by notin~ the following tabulation of the values of Routh's
discriminant, denoted by R:

A similar investigation for lateral stability fails to show any marked
change with s~eed, as would be expected since speed depends on
pitch angle ana the factors which make or unmake lateral stability
are but slightly affected by angle of pitch.

are the components of angula,l' momentum,-the CJ.uant~ties A,. B, 0
being the moments and D, E, F the products of mertla relatIve to
the moving axes fixed in the body.
The symmetric aeroplane will alone be considered here;

D-F=O.

(4)

If the machine is in uniform horizontal flight, all the forces,
moments, linear velocities and angular velocities except u' vanish,
and u' = U, a negative quantity in magnitude equal to the tmiform
velocity. (The precise backward direction of the x-axis is that
which is horizontal in uniform flight, and hence by this definition the
direction of this axis, and of the z-axis, varies in the aeroplane with
the speed.)
If the motion is slightly disturbed, the velocities take the values
(5)

u' = U+u, v' =v, w' =w, p' =p, q' =q, r' =r,

where u, v, w, p, q, r are small. The products of these small quantities are neglected, as in all discussions of small oscillations, and the
equations take the form
du/dt=X', dv/dt+ Ur = Y', dw/dt- Uq=Z',

(6)

Adp/dt - Edr/dt =mL', Bdq/dt =mlrJ', Odr/dt - Edp/dt =mN' .

(7)

In uniform motion the forces and moments all vanish. For the
disturbed motion they are small and may be expressed linearly in
terms of u, v, w, p , q, r. The forces are due to three sources: 1° the
propeller thrust, 2° gravity, 3° the air. We shall assume that the
propeller thrust (and moment, if any, arising from it) is constant; i. e.,
the motor is supposed to speed up or slow down under changed conditions so as to deliver a constant thrust. If 0 and <p are the small
pitch and roll, the components of gravity are gO, - g<p, - g (see
Bairstow, 144, 7u - w), and its moments are zero because the C. G. is
taken as origin. The air forces and moments may be written as
X, Y, Z, L, lrJ, N and develop ed as
X =Xo+Xuu + Xvv+ X ww+Xpp+ Xqq+Xrr,

(8)

where X u, .L v , • • . •• are the ({resistance derivatives " taken for
Y
the relative velocity of machine and wind. (Xo and the propeller
thrust cancel, so do Zo and g; Yo, L o, Mo, No vanish.)
In the symmetric aeroplane half the resistance derivatives vanish
and the six equations of motion separate into two sets of three each,
one set for the longitudinal, the other for the transverse motion.
These equations are (Bairstow, 148, 13 and 14 with 8 = 0) for longitudinal motion,
du/dt=g()+Xuu+Xww+Xqq,

LONGITUDINAL MOTION IN SMALL GUSTS.

A gust if no t too severe m ay be treated by the method of forced
oscillations. If the aeroplane is traveling on an irregular wind, we
may regard the average wind velocity relative to the machine as that
which should be used in the computation of the resistance derivatives, and we may regard the departures of the actual relative velocity
from the mean as small quantities inducing additional forces into
the equations of motion.
Suppose :first a head-on gustiness. This would introduce an extra
term of the form Xuu into the :first equation, Zuu in the second,
and so on. If, as a result of the gust, the machine tilted appreciably,
the originally head-on gust would no longer be head-on, but would
have components U lI WI and give rise to the term X U u 1 + X W w 1 in the
:first equation. It is clear, however, that under the hypothesis of
small oscillations, Wi would remain small of the second order relative
to u 1 • The term X W w 1 could then be neglected relative to .LYUulI
unless Xw much exceeded Xu'
We should in general allow a gust to have componentsuil Vii W il Pll
(j1l r 1 relative to the axes. This would take into account any possible rotational motion in the gust. The rotational motion of a gust
may be quite small. In the discussion by Glazebrook (Aeronautical
Journal, July, 1914, pp. 272-301) nothing is accomplished relative
to rotational gusts. Yet it may well be that the rotational element
is of great importance. For the rot ary derivatives, in the case of
the machine whose derivatives are tabulated by Bairstow (loc. cit.,
159), are large. Thus a term Mq(jl = -210(jl would be comparable
with X U 1 = -0.14u1 if (jl were 1/700 of u 1 ; i. e., if the gust were a uniu
form whirl of radius 700 teet. In tho same way Lp is large. In the
machine that will be discussed in what follows Mq is also large,
viz.,-150.

The equations for the longitudinal motion in a general gust are

AERONAUTICS.

Possible methods of treating gusts.-The only treatment of gusts
which I have seen is that described somewhat popularly b[ Glazebrook Ooc. cit.). He seems to state, as the main method 0 attack,
that of small differences whereby it is assumed that the involved
time over which the motion is to be studied is divided into small parts,
and that the atmospheric conditions remain constant during each of
these parts. By then regarding the differential equations of motion
as equations in differences of the following form,
b.U' = (X' -w'q' +v'r')b.t, etc.,

b.h1 = (mL' +r;h2 - q'hs)b.t, etc.,
it is possible to compute, through a series of intervals b.t, the approximate positions of the aeroplane. This method is, as Glazebrook
states, exceedingly tedious, for b.t must be taken very small, indeed
only a small part of a second in the case of a sharp gust, in order that
the solution may be even approximately satisfactory for the differential equations. Moreover, the whole calculation apparently has
to be done from the beginning for each new type of O'ust which one
desires to study. The method, however, is applicabfe in all generality irrespective of the stability of the aeroplane.
The reason that I have chosen to operate on the basis of small
oscillations is that after a certain amount of preliminary calculation
has been accomplished my formulas will enable me to treat very
rapidly a series of very different types of gusts. My method is not
applicable, of course, to machines which are not stable, for the oscillatIOns could not remain small with such machines, but it is probably
doubtful whether the motion of the unstable aeroplane in a gusty
wind is of very great importance, as the instability of the machme is
not unlikely to cause indeterminately violent motions on relatively
small gusts. I have tried to devise methods which would enable me
to use graphical apparatus for obtaining the solutions here desired,
but have been unable to throw the equations into a form which lends
itself to such methods.
Moreover, the coefficients which enter into the equations and into
the solutions at all stages of the work are of such varying ma!p1itudes
that it is difficult to obtain any reasonably accurate results. It seems
impossible-I have not yet succeeded in avoiding the difficulty-to
eliminate the occasional necessity of subtracting numbers which are
nearly equal in magnitude; thus the accuracy of the figures is, after
subtraction, seriously impaired. As I was aware that the data furnished me were probably not accurate to three figures, I first made
the calculations with slide-rule accuracy, only to find that the final
results became wholly illusory, owing to the difficulty just mentioned.
I have therefore had to recompute everything with 4-place logarithm
tables. Most of the figures which occur in the work are therefore
4-place numbers. Those which appear to have only three significant
figures generally have the fourth figure zero when occurring in
formulas containing 4-place numbers. In the calculations toward the
end of the research the 4-fiO'ure accuracy has become reduced to
three or two figure accuracy, ~ut it did not seem best systematically
to reduce the numbers by the omission of two figures, although this
reduction has occasionally been made in final calculations.

considerable accuracy, and the rough :first approximations, such as

b = .03914. Also, 8.364(.0391) + 23.43a = 3.385 or 23.43a = 3.058
and a='.1305. Hence the second factor is
DZ + .1305D + .03914.

As a check on the work we may multiply the two factors together;
we find

D4 + 8.494D3 + 24.56D2 + 3.385D + .9170.

about 9~ times as effective in u as ill w. Moreover, the short period
motions in u and ware about quartered; but the long period motions
are in opposite phase. The amplitude of the short period motion in
8 is about
that of w; hence for each foot-second of short oscillation
in w there is about to in 8. The amplitude of the long period motion
in 8 is about .006 of that in u; hence for each foot-second of long
oscillation in u there is about 1° in 8. The damping of the short
.oscillation is so strong that the amplitude is reduced to about one-

ninetieth in one second where in the case of the long oscillation
the reduction is only to about nine-tenths of its original value in one
second; the relative amplitudes in the cases of u, w, (J are more
important in the case of the long than in that of the shor t period
oscillation because the latter is so quickly damped out that the
swing may not get well started. However, the extreme magnitude of
the short period oscillation in W as compared with u indicates the
possibility of relatively violent accelerations in W,' indeed, it is the
short period oscillation which may account for initial difficulties
whereas the long period oscillation accounts for the progressive
troubles, due to gusts.

SOME SPECIAL GUSTS.

If we wish to represent a gust which, starting from the condition
of still air, increases to a certain intensity J we may use the function
(24)

The value of l' determines the sharpness of the gust. If r = I, the
gust has reached about two-thirds of Its value in one second; if r=5,
the gust has reached two-thirds of its value in one-fifth of a second;
if r=t, the two-thirds intensity is reached in 5 seconds. We may perhaps regard r = 1 as giving a moderately shar~ gust, r = 5 as giving a
very sharp, and l' =t as giving a toll'lrably IDlld gust. The functlOn
(24) has the advantage of being in such form that the determination
of the particular integrals is easy. (See Wilson's Advanced Calculus.)

8=Je-·0654t(.00495 cos .187t- .0031 sin .187t) - .00495Je-· 2t .

It arpears from these equations that the effect of a mild head-on
gust 0 magnitude J is as follows: (1) The machine takes up an easy
slowly damped oscillation in u of amplitude about 89 per cent of J;
after the oscillation dies out the machme is making a speed J less relative to the ground and hence the original speed relatIve to the wind.
(2) There is a rapidly damped oscillation in w of rather small magnitude and a slowly damped one of about 10 per cent of J, the final
condition being that of horizontal flight. (3) There is a slow oscillation in pitch of about .0058 J radians or about .32 JO. If the magnitude J is great, the 'pitching becomes so marked that the approximate method of solutIOn can no longer be considered valid-a gust
of 20 foo t.-seconds causing a pitch of some 6°. As the period is Tong
(about one-half minute) the pilot should have ample time to con-ect
the trouble before it produces serious consequences.
'
The result of a tail-on gust is the opposite of that of the head-on
gust and therefore need not be treated separately. For the head-on
gust J is negative; for a rear gust, positive.
To calculate the stresses on the machine or operator caused by the
gust we have merely to find the accelerations du/dt and dw/dt of which
the first is (approximately)du/dt=Je-·0654t(.08 cos .187t - .16 sin .187t) - .05Je-· 2t .

This acceleration reaches a maximum of something of the order of
J/I0; and if J should be 20 foot-seconds, the acceleration would be
only about 2, or 6 per cent of g-not a large amount. The acceleration dw/dt is likeWIse small. (N. B.-The initial accelerations du/dt
and dw/dt should vanish, because the gust starts from zero. That
the initial values are not exactly zero in the above formulf!,s is due to
the roughness of the final calculations for u and w.)
The path of the machine varies from the horizontal by the amount

which accounts for the effect of the vertical velocity and of the climbing in the path. The result is (roughly)
z= J l~-·0654t(.5 cos .187t-.4 sin .187t)dt- .5e-· 2t dt,
z= J[e-·0 6
5-1t(cos .187t+3 sin .187t)+ 2.5e-· 2t -3.5].

The motion is oscillatory approaching as a limit z = - 3.5 J. The
machine will rise 70 feet when the gust is 20 foot- econds h ead-on.

The effect of the up gust is to set up a small long oscillation in u
of magnitude about 0.3 J, a very sm all oscillation III W, and a long
.
oscillation of intensity .0018 J radians or .11 J Oin O The comparative effects on the velocity and angle in the case of head-on and up
gusts show that the up gust is only about one-third as effective as the
head-on gust. The accelerations in the case of the up gust are all
small.
To find the displacement in a vertical direction we integrate as
before.

It is scarcely necessary to trouble with the trigonometric terms
partly because the motlOn is less pronounced than in Case 1, partly
because there is here the secular term Jt, which will carry the machine
up with the gust and will be the chief effect after the lapse of a shor t
time.
A down gust is in every way the opposite of an up gust and n eed

The effect of the rotary gust is a long oscillation in u (the short
one is n egligible) of magnitude about 670 J, a short oscillation in w
of about 17 J and a long one of about 71 J, a long oscillation in e of
about 4.1 J. The comparison with former cases may be made by
supposing first that the oscillation in u may reach some 20 footseconds. Then J = 1/33 = .03. The amplitude of the oscillation
in e is then some 0.12 Tadians, which is an amount comparable with
the 6° of Case 1. To get an idea of what J = .03 means, we may
note that if a gust of 20 foot-seconds is due to a whirl of the air as
a solid body WIth ql = .03, the radius of the whirl is 660 feet. We
may therefore say that the effect of a whirl of radius 660 generating
velocity of 20 foot-seconds is of itself about equal to that of a head-on
velocity of that amount. If, however, a machine ran into such a
whirl, 'it would experience both the effect of the whirl and of the
linear velocity generated by it and would be disturbed considerably
more than if it had encountered a pure head-on gust. We may
therefore say that if the head-on gust arises from a whirl of materinlly less than 660-foot radius, the effect of the whirl is quite considerably larger than that due to a straight head-on gust of equal
magnitude.
The conditions after enough time has elapsed to allow the exponential term to become small is
1u= -610 .6 J. I w =86.2 J . 18=2.865 J.
It is therefore seen that the machine takes up the head-on velocity,
acquires a small upward velocity, and is inclined at an angle 2.865J
radians to the horizontal l these effects being due exclusively to
the rotary motion of the au'. The path in space could be obtained
by integration, but (like the effects previously mentioned) would
not be the true path if the rotary motion were accompanied by
horizontal or vertical linear gusts. It seems therefore scarcely
worth while to find the p ath.
The value that I attach to this theory of rotary gusts does not
arise so much from the fact that such gusts seem nowhere to have
been treated as from the revelation of the powerful effects of such
gusts. When a machine is flying low it must expect to meet air
which has b een set in rotation by the friction of the wind against
the ground, against buildings, or against trees. It seems certa~
that very m aterial angular velocities might be set up and that these
might (owing to their short radius) induce only moderate linear
gusts. In such cases, if they can arise as assumed, the machine
25302 °-S. Doc. 268, 64-1-5

might behave very much worse than could be foreseen when nothing
is known of rotary gusts. It is not unlikely, however, that rotary
gusts would be very irregular themselves and that, before the
machine could feel the full effects of one, the ~ust might have disappeared. In the same way rotation could be generated at the

The short oscillation in u is negligible not only in regard to its
magnitude but even as far as accelerations are concerned. Then
dujdt=Je· 06Ht ( - .1 cos .187t + .21 sin .187t) + .1Jet.
This is at most about .25 J, or 5 foot-seconds 2 if J = 20. The short
oscillation in w is considerably smaller than the long, but when the
coefficients - 4.18 and 2.43 are brought in by differentiating to find
dwjdt, whereas - .0654 and .187 are brought in by the long oscillation, it appears that the short oscillation IS effective in determining
the acceleration. Thus
dwjdt = J e-4 • 18t (.12 cos 2.43t - .07 sin 2.43t)
+Je· o654t (.01 cos .187)-.13 Jet.
The amount of this acceleration is at most about Jj12, one-third that
in u; the effect, however, is produced very quickly, in the first half
'second.
In integrating to find the path in a vertical plane we may neglect
the short oscillation, because in this case we divide by -4.18 and
2.43, whereas for the long oscillation we divide by - .0654 and .187.

The short oscillation is negligible in u as far as concerns u itself.
In calculating the acceleratIOn du/dt the short oscillation is not
negligible relative to the long; but the acceleration is small any way.
The effect of an up gust J on u is about one-third the effect of an
equal head-on gust (see Case 2).
The short oSClllation is the main thing in w-its amplitude is about
J/4, whereas the amplitude of the long oscillation is about J/40, or
one-tenth as much. The acceleration dw/dt may therefore be calculated exclusively from the short oscillation; it is
dw/dt = J e- 4 • ISt (1.2 cos 2,43t) - J (1- e-t).

This means values approximately as follows:
t=O, Ys,
U,
Y2,
%,
acc.=O,-.35 J,-.6 J,-.7 J,-.6 J.

If J should be 20 foot-seconds , the maximum acceleration would
be about g/2, even a gust of 10 foot-seconds would produce an acceleration of g/4. Such accelerations coming upon the pilot in one-half
a second might con.,iderably surprise and disturb him. An addition
of 25 to 50 per cent in the apparent weight of the machine could
hardly strain it to an appreciable extent in view of the large factor
of safety used in the design. (N. B.-For an up gust J is negative.
For a down gust the operator would lose 25 to 50 per oent of his
weight.)
The path of the machine in space is not of great importance in
this case. The chief feature is the general drift of the machine with
the current.
CASE 6. Rotary gust-moderate. qi =J (1- e-t ).
As we know so little of the rotation in the atmosphere and as
nothing particular of interest seems to be indicated for this case
over and above what was found in Case 3, we shall not carry out the
calculations.

Here again the short oscillation in u ia insignificant. The long
oscillation as ill Case 4 has an amplitude a little ill excess of J. The
acccleration duNt is small of the order J/5. The reason that a sharp
head gust docs not give a large value to du/dt i probably because
the gust can blow thToug:h the maehine; the acceleration is therefore
not large except at tho L
OOpS of tho slow oscillation.
'1'he short-period' oscillation in w h as now b ecome stronger than
tho long oscillation and the acceleration dwjclt is mostly due to it
and may be written
dw/dt=Je-4 ·1St(- .25 cos 2 .43t-1.13 sin 2.43t) + .25 Je- 5t .

Tho value of the acceleration never gets large b ecause it is damped
out b efore the sine term gets effective-perhaps - 0.4 J would be
about ita maximum value. A sharp hcad-on gust is therofore about
half as effective as a moderate up gust of the same intensity. Since
up gusts arelerhaps not likely to be as intense as h ead-on gusts, we
might hazar a gue s that sharp head-on gusts would inconvenience
the pilot about as much as moderate up gusts.
The most important terms in the path in space are
z= Je-·OS54t (1.2 sin .187t+3 ..5 cos .187t)-3.5 J.

The oscillation in u is of long period, and the acceleration in tL is
small. The oscillation in W has a short-period term of !ITeat importance at the start, but except for tllis there is very littfo 0 cil1ation
in w. The acceleration is

dw/dt = J e-4.l81(2.9 cos 2.43t-9.2 sin 2.43t) -2.8 J e- 5t .
(N. B.-The value of dw/dt when t=o should be 0 instead of J/I0.
The failure to check seems due to multiplication of errors, which is
unavoidable. The accuracy of the work ill Case 8 and Case 5 appears
reduced to two figures.) The acceleration is now very serious indeed;
it is about - 9.2 J e- 4.18t sin 2.43t, as thc other two terms come
near canceling. The maximum value OCCUl'S when t = .217, a little
over one-fifth of a second, as is then about -1.85 J. If J should
be as large as -18 foot-seconds, the acceleration would equal g = 3'2.
Clearly such a sharp gust if it existed would be very dangerous from
the sudden forces it would bring into play. As the machine, however, would travel only about 24 feet during one-fifth second, it is
reasonable to doubt whether in so short a distance so large a change
in vertical air velocity could occur.
The path in space IS found to be approximately
2=- 1.2 J e- 418t cos 2.43t+1.1 Je-· 06~4t cos .187t-.J J e- 5t + .:.z J-Jt.

The final effect is the general drift with the gust, less a lag of J /5 .

SUMMARY.

I have indicated the general method, based on the theory of small
oscillations, whereby the equations of motion of a stable aeroplane,
whether free or constrained to fly without pitch, whether in teady
or gusty air, may be completely integrated in su ch form that, after
a certam amount of preliminary calculation, the effects upon the
motion of a large number of different gust may be determined with
relative ease. So far as I am aware, no actual method of integration
nor any quantitative results of such an integration has previously been
published with the exception of the descriptive popular lecture of
Glazebrook cited above. I have carried through the actual determination of the effects of gusts in the following cases:
Head-on gusts rising from 0 to J feet per second with various degrees of sharpness.
Up gust of the same type.
Rotary gusts of the same type.
Rear gusts and down gust are included by merely changing the
sign of J. For convenience, it has b een assumed that the machine
is in still air except for the gustiness; u a matter of fact gusts are
usually superposed upon a general steady wind of other than zero

average velocity; b~t the condition~ of flight in.still air a.nd in steady
air are nearly IdentlCal, the only difference beillg that ill the equations of motion the resistance derivatives are calculated from the
relative wind, whereas V is the actual velocity over the ground.
It h as been found that a stable machine, WIth controls untouched,
running into a h ead gust of various sharpness and of total intensity
J foo t-second will swoop up , with some oscillation of no serious character, to a n ew level about 3.5 J feet higher than its previous level.
The constrained machine will rise without oscillation to a new level
only J feet, or a trifle less, higher than before. The path in a vertical plane is indicated in the diagrams ill'awn for me by Mr. T. H.
Huff. The accellerations arising ill the motion are not serious for
either the machine or the pilot. It has been found further that a
rotary gust may have consIderable effect-though in the absence of
data as to th e intensity and regularity of rotation in the air no definite
results can be formulated . Furthermore we find that up gusts
operate chiefly in lifting th e machine, whether free or constramed,
with the gust. The path in space is O"iven in the diagram. There is
here in the case of sharp gusts a consi~erable momentary acceleration
in the vertical which may reach a magnitude of about 1.5 J footseconds.2 'l'his would not seriously stress the machine, which is
designed to stand accelerations of 6 g to 8 g in maneuvering, but
owing to its sudden and unexpected appearance this acceleration
might incommode the pilot-it is indeed the familiar phenomenon of a
"bump."
It follows, therefore, that the introduction of the constraint ,
whether by .~yroscopic or other means, serves only to eliminate the
natural oscillation in pitch and to diminish, in the case of the head
or rear gusts only, the final change of level. As a rear gust of 20
foot-seconds is found to drop the uncontrolled machine by more than
80 feet in 15 seconds, flight at low altitudes is more da~erous in the
unconstrained than in the constrained machine. .tiowever, the
elapsed time is sufficiently great to enable the pilot to check the dip
by a suitable movement of his elevator.
To offset any advantages derived from the constraint, we find that
this l articular machine, when constrained, becomes unstable at a
spee between 47 and 51 mile-hours, whereas the free machine remains
stable down to a peed b etween 45 and 47 mile-hours.
