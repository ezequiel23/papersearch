Increase in Maximum Pressures Produced by Preign1.tion in
Internal Combust ion Engines.

With the high compression ratio of the aviation engine,
preignition is of

freq~nt occ~ence.

That extremely high tempe r-

atures are a result. is fairly well recogniz ed , but little attention
seems to have been given to the pressures that prevail in the cylinder under these conditions.

It need scarcely

ever, that accurate knowledge of the maximum pressure in the cycle
is essential to the design of an engine that shall have a known factor of safety.
In the course of the investigation of the effect of compressian ratio on altitude performance, which is being conducted for the
National Advisory Committee for Aaronautjcs at the Bureau of Standards, the curves shown on Sheet No. 1 ware obtained.

A change of spark

runs.

It appears that the charge is completely burned early in the

pression stroke.

It is then compressed and bacause of the loss of

heat to the walls of the combustion chamber the first part of the expansion line falls below the corresponding compression line.

As a

result, the negative work of the first part of the expansion

stro~

is nearly

e~ual

to the positive work at the latter end,

If the absoJ.ute temperature at the beginning of tho compression stroka

is 350°0. the final te~perature Tz will thus be 662°0.

Now assume

the firing of the charge to result in a temperature increase in ths
mixture of 2000°0.

The importance of making every effort to avoid preignition
is appcu'ent.

Most important of all, however, is that the engineer
