Tables I, II, and IH give tile results
of a number
of tests, using tit1, three different
sets of
pistons,
the horsepowers
deduced
from these tests having
been corrected
to 0 ° C.
The data
contained
in these tables are plotted

during
the test to the mean

To obtain
this relation
between
temperature
and

use was made
of the information

In the tests performed
in tim altitude
laboratory
the runs were conducted
at four barmlmtri(.
pressures,
which were adopted
as standards
for comparing
the results
of different
tests and also
to facilitate
computations.
In the later tests, series 99 to lll,
carried
out with the high compression
pistons,
the horsepowers
were corrected
to the mean
temperatures
corresponding
to
the observed
barometric
pressures,
consequently
it was necessary
to establish
a set of standard
temperatures
corresponding
to the different
standard
barometric
pressures.
The mean values
of these four "standard"
temperatures
obta{ned
from curve

from the Smithsonian
Meteorological
Tables
for 1907, page 100, in which h is the

The curves
on plot 8 illustrate
the variation

with compression

The horsepower

with the 5.3 or "high"

As will be seen upon

as the engine
conditions,

condition
of valves,
etc., were not the same in each case.
However,
the manner
in which the
horsepower
varies
with barometric
pressure
in each case may be taken
as characteristic
for
the given combination
of engine,

and fuel with a given compression
ratio.
In conclusion,
it may be stated
that
practically
all the tests conducted
in the altitude
laboratory
show nearly
the same relation
between
horsepower
and altitude.
An), given set

to investigate the results
obtained
by increasing
the carburetor

of an airplane
engine,
and to evaluate
the effect of this upon the horsepower

In practice,
supercharging
may be accomplished
by means of a blower driven from the engine

SUPERCHARGING.

The following
report
is based upon a test made in the altitude
laboratory
of the Bureau
of
Stan.dards
to determine
the effect produced
upon the horsepower
output
of an airplane
engine
by the introduction
of air to the carburetor
at a higher
pressure
than the exhaust
or back pressure.
_;uch a condition
is easily produce(l
in this laboratory,
as the engine under test is inclosed
in a chamber
in which the air pressure
may be controlled,
independently
of that on the carburetor inlet, by means of suitable
pipes and valves leading
to a suction
blower.
A more complete
description
of this method
of controlling
the
barometric
pressure
is given in Technical
Report
No. 44.
A stock
150-1iorsepower
Hispano-Suiza
engine,
built by the Wright-Martin
Aircraft
Corporation,
New Brunswick,
N. J., having
a compression
ratio of 5.3 to 1, was used in making
the
test.
The Claudel
carburetor,
with which the engine is equipped,
was adjusted
in each case to
give minimum
fuel consumptiou
consistent
with maximum
power.
Two runs were made with approximately
a constant
pressure
on the carburetor,'and
with
varying
exhaust
back pressures
in each case.
The first run was made with the valve on the
intake
wide open, so that the highest
pressure
Could be obtained
at the carburetor.
The pressure within
the chamber,
which is the same as ttie exhaust
back pressure,
was adjusted,
and
readings
taken at values of approximately
62, 50, 38, and 34 cm. Hg.
The data obtained
are
tabulated
in Table I, and the results
are plotted
as curve A on plot 1.
In the second run, the valve on the intake was partially
closed, so that the pressure
on the
carburetor
was the equivalent
of 20 cm. Hg below
the prevailing
atnospheric
pressure,
and
readings
taken
at approximately
the same points
as before.
The results
of this run are given
in the second half of Table I and are plotted
as curve B on plot 1.
In the first run the pressure
of the intake
air was not constant
throughout,
varying
from
72.67 to 70.22 cm. Hg, so that
it was necessary
to correct
the results
to some constant,
pressure.
The correction
was made to a pressure
of 70 cm. Hg by interpolation,
which is based on

exerts a back pressure

From the curves

VARIATION OF HORSEPOWER

WITH

TEMPERATURE.

The horsepower
of an internal-combustion
engine
varies with the temperature
of the air
admitted
to the cm'buretor.
In order to reduce
the horsepower
at any observed
temperature
to horsepower
at a chosen
standard
temperature,
if. has ordinarily
been assumed
that
the
horsepower
varies inversely
as the absolute
temperature
of the carbureior
air, other conditions
being held constant.
In the testing
of airplane
engines
at the altitude
laboratory
of the Bureau
of Standards
the horscpower
at the observed
carburetor
air temperaiure
has been reduced
1o arbitrary
standard
temperatures
in order to furnish
a common
basis for Comparing
the results
of different
tests.
The te_ts used to determine
the approximate
variation
of horsepower
with temperature
were all made on two ttispano-Suiza
engines built by the Wright-Martin
Aircraft
Corporation,
New Brunswick,
N.J.
The first engine, used i_ the majority
of the runs, was of 150 horsepower,
known
as type A, while the remaining
runs were made witlt the 180-hol_cpower,
type E.
Three
different
carburetoi_
were used, tests Nos. 79, 80, and 104 having
been made on
the 150-homcpower
engine with the Claudcl
carburetor,
test No. 103 on the same engine with
the Tice carburetor,
and tests Nos. 116, 117, and 119 on the 180-horsepower
engine with the
Stromberg
carburetor.

for every

the Claudel

were adjusted
by hand to give

power,
but the Tice carburetor
was an experimental
one, designed
for inherent

control,
and was therefol_

As the Tice carburetor
differs

In order to correct
horsepower
at a given observed
barometric
pressure
and temperature
to
horsepower
at the actual
temperature
corresponding
to the altitude
of the given
barometric
pressure,
it is necessary
to know the mean actual
temperatures
existing
at the various
altitudes.
To obtain this relation
the information
contained
in Aeronautic
Instruments
Circular
No. 3,
issued by the Bureau
of Standards,
was used, resulting
in the altitude-temperature
curves
on
plots 8 and 9.
As it is necessary
for the purpose
of comparison
to Correct an observed
horsepower
for both
temperature
and barometric
pressure
it is desirable
to obtain
an expression
for a correction
factor which shall include
both corrections.
The results
of numerous
tests in the altitude
laboratory
indicate
that
for the ordinary
slight differences
in barometric
pressure
met with from day to day, the assumption
that
the
brake horsepower
varies directly
as the barometric
pressure
is sufficiently
accurate.
The true
variation
of horsepower
with altitude
is, however,
fully covered
in Part I of this report:
Upon
the assumption
that
the horsepower
developed
varies
directly
as the barometric
pressure
we have:

In using these charts it should be borne in mind that the majority

-20 ° and 15 ° C. (-4 ° and 59 ° F.), respectively.
However,
the three later tests with the 180

temperatures
of -15 ° and 50 ° C. (5 ° and 122 ° F.), and
the results,
as given in Tables V and V[ and on plot 6, check very closely the average
of the
earlier

IV.

OF WATER INJECTION
By

ON ENGINE

PERFORMANCE2

V. W. _BRINKEIqHOFF.

R_SUM]_.

A short investigation
has been conducted
at the Bureau of Standards
to determine
the
effect of water injected into the intake manifold of an internal combustion
engine.
This investigation
was carried out. on two different engines, truck and automobile, but the results in
general are such as to apply also to airplane engines.
The first series of tests was conducted
to determine whether the use of water injected into
the intake manifold has any effect on the horsepower
output and fuel economy;
the second
series to determine
the effect, upon the carbon deposit on the cylinder walls and piston heads.
The data obtained indicate that in an engine of good design there is no appreciable
gain in
power or fuel economy due to the injection of water, but in a badly carbonized
or a poorly
designed engine, where hot spots due to improper cooling are present, a slight increase in power
may result.
If enough water be used, it will remove a small portion of the carbon but will
cause at the same time a considerable
reduction in the operating efficiency of the engine.
The maximum amount of water used in these tests was limited to that which did not
materially
interfere
with the normal
operation
or power output of the engine and the results do not indicate
the value of much larger quantities
of water as injected under special
conditions solely as a carbon removing agent.
INFLUENCE

OF

WATER

INJECTION

ON

ENGINE

PERFORMANCE.

The object of this investigation
has been to determine from dynamometer
tests the effect
of the injection of water into the intake manifold of an engine on the power output, fuel economy,
carbonization,
and general engine performance.
It has been claimed by advocates
of water
injection into the intake manifold that the use of water in this way results in--(1) Increase of power.
(2) Decrease in fuel consumption.
(3) Decrease in carbon deposit on pistons, valves, and combustion
chambers.
The tests made at the Bureau of Standards,
covering a period of some seven weeks, have
been run primarily
to meet the needs of the Inventions'
Board of the War College, and the
scope of this investigation
was determined
by a conference between members of the Inventions'
Board and the st'lff of the Bureau of Standards.
While no attempt has been made at an exhaustive study of the problem it. is thought that the data from these tests will answer in a
general way the question of t.he effect of water injection upon engine performance_ _ Although
the engines used were of the type employed in motor trucks and automobiles,
the results are of
such character as to apply in general to airplane engines.
For use in these experiments
the Inventions'
Board provided, one of the War Department's
standardized
truck engines, class B. This engine was connected
to a Sprague
Electric Co.
125-horsepower
dynamometer,
and provisions made for all auxiliary
apparatus
necessary
to
obtain the data recorded below.
This engine is a 4-cylinder conventional
design with a bore
of 4.75 inches and stroke of 6 inches, giving a total piston displacement
of 425 cubic inches.
The intake manifold is of the "hot. spot" type.
The clearance volume was found to average
37 per cent of the swept volume, giving the very low compression ratio of 3.7.
The average compression
pressure as determined
by an O'Kill indicator was found to be
47.75 pounds per square inch at 100 revolutions
per minute with jacket water at 55 ° C.

CO_f_fITTEE

FOR

AERON'AUTICS.

The test data given on the accompanying
log sheets were obtained
as follows:
The engine was first, warmed
up to operating
temperature
and the carburetor
adjusted
to
give maximum
power
at maximum
speed and then power'runs
made, using ordinary
gasoline,
with spark set. for maximllm
power, all data being taken over a period of five minutes
and averaged.
Vv'ater was then admitted
to the i_take
manifold
at a point about
1.75 inches above
carburetor
throttle
and the same data taken with the same spark settings,
followed
t)y another
run with water, but with the spark advanced
for maximum
power.
These runs were made over a
speed range of from 400 to 1,200 revolutions
per minute at in tervals of 200 revolutions
per minute.
The amount
of water used dltring any run was determiD.ed
by reading
the difference
in height of
the water,
at the beginning
and end of the run, in a graduate
cylinder
of 1,000 co. capacity
and
observing
time elapsed
b_- means
of a stop watch:
The amount
of water used was controlled
by means
of a glass stop cock in the line between
the graduate
cylb)der
and the intake
maJ_ifold.
The preliminary
and test runs No. 2 and No. 3 were made with q Zenith
L6 carburetor
fitted with 25 ram. choke, 1.15 ram. main jet, and 1.25 mm. compensator
jet.
Varying
amounts
of water were used throughout
these runs.
Itl test No. 4 a Stromberg
M3 carburetor
with 13-_inch choke and No. 52 (0.0635 inch) bleeder
was substituted
to permit
of varying
the gas air
mixture
r'_tio for each speed.
This adjustmel_t
was to give the lowest
fuel consumption
consistent
with maximum
power and to ot)t_dn ,q single setting
with a rich mixture.
Tests No. 5 and No. 6 are part throttle
runs of constant
torque
and power
in each case,
simulating
thc following
road conditions:
Ro,_d resistance,
50 pounds
per ton; truck
speed,
10
miles per hour;
gross weight,
10 tons; diameter
of wheels, 40 inches;
gear ratio,
9.5 :I.
Iu test run No. 3 a metal plate withan
asbestos
gasket wasinserted
between intake and exhaust
manifold
in order to ascertain
any difference
in operation
due to a h)wer temperature
of mixture.
Commercial
gas, fulfi!]ing Ul_ited States General Supply Committee
Specifications
for 1918, and
Aeroplane
B oil, a product
of the Atlantic
Rcfining
Co., were used i1_all runs.
Particular
care h,:s
been given throughout
the tests to keep external
conditions
the same in so far as possible.
To determine
the influence
of water
injection
upon
the removal
of carbon
in an engine,
a
Rutenber
6-cylinder,
3 by 5 il_.eh engine was mounted
upon a test stand
and fitted with fan
brake for providing
a. load.
A thermo-syphon
system
of cooling was used and provision
made
for determination
of oil al_d water temperatures,
revolutions
per minute,
oil, water,
and gasolb'_e
consumption.
This e_ne
was rur_ for several
days with a very rich mixture
setting,
spark
retarded,
cooling
water
temperature
as low as possibh;,
and oil occasionally
introduced
into
cylinders
until
the valves,
piston
heads,
and combustion
chambers
were well covered
with
carbon.
The engine was thelt run for .q period of six hours at wide-open
throttle,
with water
injected
into the i'ltake
manifold,
with outlet
water at a constant
temperature
and as high as
possible.
At the end of this run the cylinder
head was removed
for inspection,
l:t was found
On this inspection
that the water ha'd not made any appreciable
effect upon the carbon
deposit..
This run was followed
by others
in which the amom_t ()f water ir_jectcd
into the mal_ifold
and
the temperatures
of the jacket inlet water were varied.
The only data taken on these tests have been the rate of water i_jection,
number
of hours,
and maximum
temp=erature
of outlet water.
The total ._mount
of water used was 27.5 gallons
for a total of 23.75 hours and a temperature
of outlet water from a minimum
of 55 ° to a maximum of 90 ° C.
The water
rate varied
from 2.4 pints
per hour
to 7.05 pints per hour, this
maximum
rate causing
some reduction
in the engine power.
The following
conclusions
have been reached
as a result
of this investigation:
(1) The injection
of water varyi'ag
in amotmt
from 0.03 pound
per brake
horsepower
tlo
0.44 pound per brake horsepower
per ho_u. does not produce
any appreciable
effect upon power,
fuel economy,
or operation
in general.
(2) Injection
of water
exceediJlg
0.44 pound
per brake horsepower
per hour is accompanied
by an appreciable
decrease
in power,
fuel economy,
and smoothness
of operation.
(3) It is quite probable
that with an engine badly carbonized
so that preignitio_l
occurs, or
with an engine of poor design, manifesting
this in form of hot spots due to lack of proper cooling
of _'alves, piston,
or head of combustion
chamber,
the use of water will result in increased
power.
(,t) With
a Rutenber
6-cylinder
;_ by 5 i_ch engine operating
at a high-jacket
water
temperature
the injection
of water in amou,_tn between
2 and 8 pounds per hour produced
a softening
and a slig|lt reduction
of carbon,
the reduction
in the amount
of carbon
deposit,
not exceeding

POWER.

25 per cent.
This was most noticeable
on piston
heads and valves.
At the same time, when
using water
at the maximum
rate
there was considerable
reduction
in the power of the engine.
This deposit
of carbon varies
considerably
in character,
according
as composed
of (1) that due
to.a very rich mixture,
(2) that (|tie to an excess in use of lubricating
oil, and (3) the above,
with the addition
of fine dust or dirt taken in through
the carbureting
system.
Of these three
types of carbon
deposit
the first is by far the most difficult
to remove,
and, in fact, it is found
that water injection
has little effect upon t_his kind of carbon.
