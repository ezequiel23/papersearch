THEORY OF THE IDEAL WINDMILL. *
By
Wilhelm Hoff.
Translated from the German,
by
Paris Office, N.A.C.A.

The theory of the ideal propeller**, which was ,first
established by FINSTERWALDER and afterwards completed by
BENDEMANN and PRANDTL, is of fundamental importance in solvlng 'the problerli of the action of the propeller .

The same

.t heory ma.y also be applied to the ideal windmill, concerning which it has led to simple but explicit conclusions
, which may easily be utilized as the mature fruit of earlier
work on the subject.
The following symbols*** have been adopted (see Fig. 1):
vI

velocity of the airstream (in m/s)

p,

, static pressure in the free airstre&m, (in kg!m z)

This article (29th Report of the German Testing Labora*
tory for Aircraft) i'\1aS lirri tten some what later than DrPhil. Max MONK'S investigation of the subject, but vvas
independent of same. It ~ms published as a sequel to
Dr. MUNK'S work in order to give additional prominence
to the relation existing between propeller and windmill.
Reference should also be made to !fUt il izat ion of the Wind

By a method similar to that adopted by PRANDTL* for

the propeller , any device may be considered as a

~nndmill

if it produce such change of pressure ) on any surface

F

within a certain limited edge curve, that every particle of
air penetrating the surface undergoes a reduction of pressure amounting to

b. p

constant.

The limited edge curve

is assumed, as in the case above named, to be a circle be-·
cause more comprehensive calculations are thus

obt~ined

and also because the outlines of the windmill are entirely
circular.

The change of pressure produces a slipstream be-

hind the windmill, within which the prevailing velocity is
lower than beyond it.
If

such velooity being generally variable from point to point,
not perpendioular to the surface, Bernoulli's equation for
the front part of the streamline is as follows:

Actual windmills cannot attain such high values, on
account of losses due to friction and to eddies.

Experi-

ments made on good propellers, whereby efficiencies of ,

windmills, and in that case similar or even still higher efficiencies - due to the low stream velpcities - may be anticipated*.

Various conclusions are arrived at through tte theory
of the ideal windmill:
1.

The maximum power attainable is frequently regarde d*

as being equal to the kinetic energy of the entire fluid
stream traversing the surface of the windmill, when the following is inserted, as coefficient of efficiency:

This ratio is in accordance with equation (12) for power coefficient~and is given in terms of ~in ~ig. 3.

As it has been proved, in a general manner, that

not more than 2/3 of the available wind-power can be utilized in a

winlli~ill

stationed in a free airstream, the ques-

t ion as to whether SOlLe improvement might or might not be
attained in this respect by controls, etc. meets with a
negative reply.

Should it be necessary, however, for prac-

tical reasons, to reduce the revolving parts of the machines
as far as possible, experiments must be made with a vie w to
determining whether the air available can be inducted into
the windmill through a specially constructed nozzle at high
velocity and with a small

s~ction.

If this can be done,

within certain limits, the resistance of the entire installation will be increased by the device, its losses being in-

- 10 creased and the total working coe f ficient diminished.

f r ee airstream resembles a

propeller more closely than a turbine.

The propellers of

simple type, with few blades, were most successIul, and the
same result may be anticipated for the wheels of the windmill.
As far back as 1907, LA COUR* recognized and discussed
the fact that the working power of a \rindmill does not depend on the number of its blades and that an exaggerated
number of blades, on the contrary, merely reduces its working power.

He sums up his investigations of the test mill

at Askov as follows:

LA COUR rejects multi-bladed

windmills and considers them as being favorable only to 'a
certain extent on Tlstarting" from a stationary position.
This may be explained by the fact tha t the angle of attack
of the stationary wheel with few blades is unfavorable.

Ac-

cording to LA COUR, multi-bladed propellers must have larger
pitch than those with few blades, so tbey consequently show
less tendency to this draWback.

It may here be mentioned

that LA COUR first discovered the advantage of cambered

He par--

extent the power production of Windmills may

be improved by modern wing sections must be discovered by
means of adequate

systematic tests, and the LA COUR

conclusions with regard to the number of blades oan only
be oonfirmed in the same manner.

The conclusions drawn by

MUNK in respect of the number of blades do not confirm LA
COUR'S supposition.
Ordinary propellers work with a coefficient of efficiency of./!

= 0.3 to 0.6.

The most favorable propeller ef-

ficiency coefficients being about

P = 0.59,

windmills of

high power closely resemble propellers with high power
charges.

The ordinary

win~s,

that is , the

wind close to the ground, are irregular within wide limits;
they vary in mean value and are dependent upon locality
and direotion.

The mean power of windmills in the wind is

therefore proportional to the third power of the velooity;
we must consequently take the means of the third power of

the wind velooity in order to determine the mean power of
the windmill, due to the wind.

Fig. 7 shows the differ-

ence between uniform wind and wind with a lineal variation
as function of time, of similar mean foroe.

ed in the calculation of power.
As VI > v, it may be supposed that gusts of wind might
be desirable for a windmill,

A work lately published in a well-known paper ''*

should be compared with the ideal windmill theory here de veloped.
Professor BAUDISCH (Vienna) compares his theory With
that of the water turbine and supposes the Windmill to be

He makes a general difference be-

tween high, low, and normal pressure windmills.

Acoording

to his theory, the air may undergo relative acceleration
in the vanes, or it may remain at uniform velocity or be
relatively retarded; finally, the cells may be influenced
from Without, in the axial direction or from within.
BAUDISCH thereby obtains 27 different methods of possible
construction.

Thirteen of these only have, however, proved

to be capable of construction, While one alone - a high or

The front part, as given by him, corres-

should be made to Fig. 1 in place of it.

takes BENDEMANN'S view of the stationary propell e r in his
calculation of ratio of the diameters, which is in the present case a ratio of surfaces and sbould not be thus taken
by BAUDISCH, the Windmill being "in motion".

BAUDISCH in-

cludes the viscosity of the air in his calculation, holding
it responsible for the screen effect in front of the air
Wheel.

In Karl SCHMID " S lecture* on the stationary propel-

ler, the value of his factor of viscosity is inserted as
for which we have not been able to find an adequate basis
in this work.
We cannot adopt the views of BAUDISCH.

The results of

his calculations cannot be b:rought into 'a greement with the
results of the general theory described above" and must
therefore be rejected.
