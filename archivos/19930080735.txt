I have the honar to present and dsdioateto the Aoademy
the mmrk on the theoq~ of propulsivepropellersand m the
theory of airplanes tiioh $s about to appear. Though dissimilar, these two subjeotshave been unlteci
because they I@ve some
points in Ooamlon,The .computat of the movement of an alzian
plahe oan only be oorreotlyestablishedif m are in a positim

of slip, whioh may vary greatly

In the seoond part I have reproducedthe four Papers present to the Aoademy of Sciences in June and July, 1819, and
ed
have added several developments,especiallyon the ohszaoter-

.

1etIp ourves of airplanes. I would oall attentionto two disqontinuit
ies fairly .of en pre&nted by these oumes, one prevt
iously mted.~ at large tnoidenoesgreater

tham those used in
