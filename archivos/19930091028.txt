REPORT COVERING INVESTIGATIONS OF AVIATION WIRES
AND CABLES, THEIR FASTENINGS AND TERMINAL CONNECTIONS.
By

JOHN

A.

ROEBLING'S SONS CO .

In reference to our investigations of aviation wires and cables,
their fastenings and terminal connections for stays, we have failed to
find from past practice anything that would allow us to determine
the best lines on which to procoed; therefore our study is not limited
to anyone stay design.
In making our investigation we have aimed to eliminate the use of
acid and solder, imperfect bends, flattening of cable on bends, injury
to wire, strand, and cord due to unskillful handling of material in the
field; and based on OUT study of present methods of manufacture of
aeroplanes we believe it is possible to manufacture the complete stay
here at the factory, proof test same to 50 per cent of its ultimate
strength, measure same under stres , and therefore eliminate any
uncertainty as to strength of terminal connection, length of stay, and
workmanship.
On this basis our research covered not only the terminal connection
for shop attachment, but also a connection that would allow repairs
to be made in the field wit?-out requ?'ing the use ~f blow torch and
solder, and from the followmg tests It will be readily seen that the
development eliminates any doubt on this point.
We find present practice considers" the solid wirc stay," consisting of one wire of suitable diameter and known to the trade as "aviation wire"; "the strand stay," consisting of either 7 or 19 wires
stranded together and known to the trade as "aviator strand"; also
"the cord or rope stay," consistin~ of 7 strands twisted together
forming a rope, the strands being either 7 wires or 19 wires; and the
rope kriown to the trade as "aviator cord."

THE SOLID WIRE STAY.
PLATE NO.1.

Figure 1.
Figure 1 shows the type most generally in use. An eye or loop .is
formed in tinned aviator wire and a fenule made by wrapping a thin
flat strip around both wires. The free end of the wire IS then bent
back over the flat ferrule, holding it in ylace, and the whole terminal
dipped in solder. This type of terminal is far from being satisfactory.
Its mechanical strength is low and variable. The process of soldering
involves the possibilIty of establishing a source of corrosion, as well
as injuring the quality of the wire. The making of such a terminal is
almo t necessarIly a factory proposition and provides no means for
quick and efficient field replacements.

Figure 2.
The standard terminal in Europe is shown in figure 2. This consists of an oval spring wire ferrule applied in almost the same manner
as the flat wire fimule in figure 1. Particular emphasis is placed on
the method of forming the eye in the stay before applying tlie felTule.
Radius of curve at "A" and "B," figure 2, must be exactly the same
as radius at "C." This is ealled a perfect eye. No solder is used.
The ferrule is made of wire of the same size as wire in stay and is
"spring" quality:. Nine convolutions constitute the standard length
of ferrUle. The hole in the felTule is oval and a snug fit for the two
wires formina the eye of stay. Both wire and felTule are tin
coated. The 1ree end of the wire is bent back over the ferrule and is
not fastened in any way. This holds the ferrule fimlly against the
shoulder at " A " and" B. "
Tests made on stays having this type of terminal did not show
very satisfactory results. Eighty per cent of the tests showed an
efficiency of less than 65 per cent, the free end of the wire slipping
through the felTule at failure of the stay. In the remaining 20 p er
cent of the tests the wire broke at " A," the stays having an average
efficiency of 68 per cent of the total strength of the wire.
Figure 3.
Fi?ure 3 shows eye having radii "A" and " B " different from
"c, ' which is not allowed III foreign specifications and practice.
Tests made on terminals having an eye formed as in figure 3 always
resulted in pulling through the free end of the wire at low efficiency.
Figure 4.

In order to determine whether the direction of pitch of the spiral
spring ferrule had any influence in determining the efficiency of the
stay, sample terminals having left-hand ferrules as in figure 2 and
right-hand ferrules as in figure 4 were made with a })erfect eye in both
cases, tested, and compared. The left-hand fer'"1.lle clearly showed
an efficiency of about 5 per cent more than the right-hand ferrule.
In testing the latter the free end of the wire slipped in every case.

Figure 5.

In figure 5 an effort was made so secure the free end of the wire
against slipping when strain was a'pplied to the stay l:Iy wrapping
this end around the main stay WIre. Tests on this construction
showed an average efficiency of 72 per cent, fracture taking place
at "B."
Figure 6.
Another method of securing the loose end consisted of tying
the end down on the felTule with fine annealed wire as shown in
figure 6. Tests made on this construction showed an average efficiency of 70 per cent, fracture taking place at "A."
CONCLUSIONS BASED ON ABOVE TESTS .

Observations made during tests of terminals 5 and 6 showed clearly
that the weak points of this construction existed at "B" and "A,"
respectively, ana that it was necessary to increase the friction between
the walls of ferrule and the wire of the stay under strain to increase
efficiency. Reliable information at hand showed that the same con-

elusions had been aimed at by foreign engineers stationed in America
and ~hat ~hey had solved the problem by. soldering the spring .ferrule
termmal m the same manner that AmerIcans had adopted wIt.h t.he
flat. wire terminal.
HORN'S IMPROVED TERMINAL CONNECTION.

In an effort to avoid the use of solder with its many objectionable
features types of construction as shown in figures 7 to 15, inclusive,
were origmated and tested. In every case the spring ferrule with
left-hand pitch was adopt.ed. The loose end of wire was secured
with a tie or simple wire loop or clip as shown. Numerous t.ests made
at intervals throughout the entire series of tests with wires having
strengths of 1,600, 1,800, and 2,300 pounds showed conclusively that
there is no difference in efficiency of stays using wire of any of the
above strengths.
Figure 7.
Figure 7 shows a wedge between the ferrule and free end of wire
so placed that as strain is applied to the stay and the bend in the
free end of wire drawn toward the ferrule the wedge is forced in and
thus increases the friction between the wall of tlie ferrule and the
main stay wire. Average efficiency secured, 82 per cent; range of
efficiency, 80 to 4 per cent. Fracture at "A" in ferrule.

Figure 8.
Figure 8 shows two wedges with a connecting yoke. The wedges
enter on each side between the two wires and force them apart and
against the wall of the ferrule as strain is applied. The wedO"es are
forced in by pressure on the connecting yoke which passes un~er the
bend of the free end of the wire as this free end is drawn into the
ferrule under strain. Average efficiency of terminal in test equals
80 per cent. Range of efficiency in t ests made, 79 to 83 per cent.
Fracture at " A. "
Figure 9.
In construction of figure 9 two wedges were used as in figure 8, but
the yoke was replaced by a washer with two holes in it encircling
both wires of the stay. Pressure on the wed~es was supposed to be
secured under strain by the drawing in of the loose end under strain.
This result was not realized as the washer became locked on the main
wire and broke the loose end at " D ." Efficiency secured was only
70 per cent; range, 60 to 75 per cent.
Figure 10.
In figure 10 two wedges were used as in figUl'e 8 and figure 9. The
free end of the wire was wrapped around the main stay wire and
pushed in the wedge as initial slippage occurred. Aver~e efficiency,
84 per cent; range, 75 to 87 per cent. Fracture at "A" III ferrule.
Figure 11.
Figure 11 shows a double eye with no wedge. Standard straight
ferrule with free end tied. This type of eye could only be used on
stays when turnbu ckles or hooks to be attached h ad open eye.
Average effici ency in test, 80 per cent; range, 74 to 82 per cent.

AERONAUTICS.

Figure 12.
Figure 12 again shows a double eye in stay with a single wedge
between wires on the eire end of the ferrule. As ferrule is drawn
down against shoulders 'A" and " B" the wedge is forced in. This
increases friction of wires against ferrule at "A" and "B," but not
at " D " and "E." Average efficiency, 85 per cent; range, 80 to 87
per cent. Fracture at "A."
Figure 13.
Figure 13 shows a construction consisting of a double eye in stay,
a single wedge under the eye, and an oval spring wire ferrule tapered
at the same angle as the wedge. In this case the pressure of the
wedge forces both wires throughout the entire length of the ferrule
against the walls of the ferrule and this increases friction on the ferrule
uniformly as the strain increases on the stay and reduces the strain
at the weak points "A" and "B" proportionately. Fracture always
took place at "E." Average effiClency, 94 per cent; range, 92 to 95
per cent.
In figure 13 we have the most efficient terminal tested. It has
none of the objections of a soldered terminal. It is simple, parts are
inexpensive, stron~, and few in number. It is an ideal terminal for
emergency use in tne field.
Figures 14 and 15.
Figures 14 and 15 show modifications of this type to overcome any
objections which mi~ht be raised to the double eye. The wedge and
a SUbstantial thimble are combined in one piece. To secure more
points of contact, and consequently greater friction, and also for
greater flexibility, the taper ferrule is made of finer wires and with
more convolutions. The wedge thimble may be open or closed, as
desired. Fracture took place at "E." Average efficiency, 94 per
cent; range. 92 to 96 per cent.

STANDARD WillE FOR STAYS FOR AEROPLANES.
The oriO'inal object in the manmactme of this material was the
secming o¥ the wire as strong as possible in order to reduce the weight
as much as possible. This resulted eventually in the manmactme of
a wire so hard and strong that difficulty was experienced in forming
the eye and bend over the ferrule without breaking the wire. The
result of this was a lack of confidence in high-strength wire, and in
some cases the reaction extended to the use of a wrre which could
properly be classed as a soft wire. The process of soldering t erminals
on wire stays undoubtedly helped to a great extent in building up
this prejudice. Nevertheless it is still true, as at first, that a strong
wire which is serviceable permits the possibility of reducing weight
and is therefore desirable. The great number of tests on wire and
stays, which were necessary to determine the properties of different
types of terminals as described above, afforded a very excellent
opportunity to note conclusively the effect of uSinfiO' various grades
and strengths of wire. We determined that it was a important that
the wire should be tough and ductile as well as strong. All bends
should be made without danger of fractme. In addition to requirement for tensile strength, we found it necessary to recommend
requirements for torsion and bend. As tho per cent efficiency of the
stay due to loss of strength at terminal is as great with a strong wire
as with a weaker wire, as was clearly demonstrated in om tests, it
followed conclusively that as high a strength as can be secmed commercially under the conditions of torsion and bend test required
was desirable. The following specification is therefore recommended
as representing suitable high-grade material for the purpose.

Breaking stmin.- Test sample should be at least 15 inches long,
free from nicks or bends. It should measure 10 inches in the clear
between the jaws of a standard t esting machine. Load should be
applied uniformly at a speed not exceeding 1 inch per minute.
Torsion.- Test sample should be gripped by two VlSes 6 inches apart.
One vise is turned uniformly at a speed not exceeding 60 revolutions
per minute. On the large size of wire this speed should be reduced
sufficiently to avoid undue heating of the WITe. The vise which is
not turned should have free lateral movement in either direction.
Bend test.-Wire for bending test should be a straight piece. One
end is clamped between jaws having their upper edges rounded to
3/16-inch radius. The free end of the wire is held loosely between
two guides and bent 90° over one jaw. This is counted one bend.
On r aising to vertical position the count is two bends. Wire is bent

The eye splice in strand and cord should be protected by means of
either steel or brass thimble.
The brass thimble can be used for 19-wire strand for diameters of
1/8 inch and smaller. For larger diameters use steel thimbles.

For the 7 by 19 cord use brass thimble for 3/16 inch diameters and
smaller, and steel thimbles for larger diamet~rs .

diameter, unless higher efficiency is required, in which case a socket
attachment can be used for the larger diameters.
Figure No. 2.-The eye splic,e is very satisfactory for 19-wire
strand for diameters not exceeding ft inch. For larger diameters
a socket attachment is necessary t o get high efficiency.
Figures Nos. 3, 4, and 5.-The tapered ferrule and wedge attachment gives maximum efficiency, and we believe can be used to great
advantage for single-wire stays.

The wedge "A" and ferrule "B" are the two important members
of the connections. After the strand or cord is placed on wedge and
through ferrule, the end of same is bent backward on ferrule ana then
served with wire.

The efficiency is nearly 100 per cent and the connection is positive

Figure No.1 shows a 19-wire galvanized aviator strand with end
looped and soldered.
Figure No.2 shows the result of test to destruction in the testing
machine. It will be noted that the break of the seven wires occurs
at the center of the stay and never at the ends. In the series of
tests made this connection showed an efficiency of 100 per cent.
Special attention is called to the protective serving of the loop. In
case this is not done a thimble must be used. The prllcipal objections
to this connection are the usc of acid and solder.

PROTECTIVE COATINGS ON STEEL WIRES.
NONFERROUS METALS- ALLOY STEELS.

We manufacture wire and cable in nonferrous metals such as monel
metal, german silver, phosphor bronze, aluminum bronze, silicon
bronze, brass, copper, etc., but we do not believe that any of these
metals will ever prove commercially practicable for the purpose of
aeroplane stays or cables. II Maximum strength with minimum
weight" appears to be too all-important. In none of these can
extreme reliability with high elasticity be so well secured as with steel
when it is well protected from mechanical injury and corrosion. For
exceptional purposes, the nonmagnetic properties of these metals
may outweigh their lack of strength and durability in fatigue, making
their use imperative, but in the final design the amount thus used
will undoubtedly be the least possible amount permissible under the
circumstances. For constructIOn of this kind we would not recommend, without many qualifications, a natural alloy such as monel
metal. This materIal appears to possess excellent noncorrosion
properties when used in a relatively large mass, as in a propeller, but
there appears to be considerable doubt as to its absolute reliability
in uniformly resisting corrosion when rolled into very thin sheets or
drawn into wire. To a lesser degree, a lack of confidence must exist
in such manufactured alloys as brass, german silver, or bronzes containing relatively large p'roportions of two or more elementary metals.
II Phosphor bronze," II silicon bronze," II aluminum bronze," or similar
alloys containing a relatively high per cent of one element (copper)

only, are more "fool-proof" and consequently more reliable and
desirable.
An attempt to give the elastic limit and tensile strength of each
size of wire, strand, and cable used in aeroplane constructlOn, if same
were made of all the nonferrous metals mentioned above, would
involve the publication of quite an extensive report. Confining ourselves to the most suitable of these metals or alloys, phosphor bronze,
aluminum bronze, etc., it is a safe and reliable rule to assume that
thc u1t.imate strength of such wire or cable or stay will be 50 per cent
of thf' ultimate strength of the extra high-strength steel listed by us
for standard aeroplane use. The elastic limit for nonferrous metals
could not safely be assumed at more than 50 per cent of the ultimate
breaking strain.
The usc of vanadium, titanium, ana other special deoxidizers or
clean ers in the manufacture of steel has undoubtedly resulted in
very much improving homogeneity and density of structure in cast,
forged, and other hot-worked masses of the metal especially in the
harder alloyed varieties. It is not so certain, however, that the use
of these metals has proven necessary or even desirable in making
steels of the higher grade for wire manufacture where the enormous
amount of cold working and exact heat treatment absolutely inherent
to the process of wire manufacture produces eventually a structure
finer and more homogeneous than has ever been possible by any
other method. The mcreased resistance to corrosion which the
special steels, referred to above, afford, because of their density and
uniformity, is more than duplicated by any drawn high-grade wire
of th e ordillary carbon steels of sufficient degree of manufacture.
Vanadium steels and other steels of their kind have not as yet
become established as desirable wire steels. Although strongly urged
upon the industry and tried time and again, they have not demonstmted their superiority.
Ca.refully made high-grade carbon steel affords to-day the most
reliable and flexible material for wire, cable, and stays, possessing
the" Rfeatcs t strength for the least weight" known in the wire industry. We know its advantage'S and we know its disadvantages. The
fact that the mechanical properties of steel wire and cable are seriously
affected by corrosion is so well known that it must be guarded against.
As the damage done is a function of time as well as intensity of chemicalor electro-chemical action on the unprotected steel, we have
investigated the question of retarding corrosion in the steel itself to
as great a degree as possible. We have found that pure iron retards
corrosion to a gI'eater degree than the more impure steel-but we have
also found that in highly extenuated filaments of these two metals,
as in wire, the difference in rate of corrosion is practically negligible,
especially when the total life of the wire protected by an external
coating such as galvanizing i taken into consideration. We have
found the use of special deoxidizers and cleansers questionable and
have not adopted them.
The use of protective coatings on steel wire or cable is a very broad
subject. Hot galvanized unwiped wire is undoubtedly the best protected wire for the purpose. Very hard wires and very fine sizes of
hard wire are likely to become brittle at the temperature of hot
galvanizing, and the next best coating available is, therefore, a tin
coating. Both of these metal coatings should be further protected

124

AERONAUTlCS .

by frequent applications of paint. As a protection to the galvanizing, a coat of red-lead paint should be applied after the stay IS as embled and the red lead protected by a coat of graphite paint.
Tlae care with whicn inspections are made from time to time and
the efficient maintenance of the paint on the wires really determines
the life of the combination. This has been proven absolutely by the
very extensive use and treatment of galvanized steel on board ship
for many years.
Nickel plating is out of the question for wires to be bent or twisted
into cable. Furthermore, nickel is absolutely injurious where the
initial purely chemical action on the intact nickel surface cea es and
electro-chemical action between steel and n'ickel begins at such spots
when steel is exposed.
We believe, therefore, that tinning and galvanizing are to-day the
most satisfactory coatings for steel wire that can be employed. They
do not actually represent the final and efficient protection which is
necessary in aeroplane construction, as this is secured by the repeated
application of paint. These coatings are, however, an efficient guard
against corrosion preliminary to service conditions in the plane and
also serve to prevent corrOSlOn and consequent damage to the steel
cables and stays in service when the paint may have been accidentally rubbed off.
RECAPITULATION.
WIRE STAYS.

As shown by tests, the terminal fastening, figures 13 and 14, on
plate No.1, are efficient, simple, and readily attached, and we believe
solve the question.
For shop attachment figure 13 or 14 would be used in connection
with shackles and clevises, and for attaching to turnbuckle eye or
other closed eyes use figure 15.
For field attachment use either figure 14 or 15.
Plates No.8 and No.9 also show these terminal connections.
WIRE SPECIFICATIONS FOR STAY WIRES.

Plate No.2 and pages 10 and 11 of this report give specifications
for wire having the highest possible strength, together with the necessary ductility for manipulation, and is tue result of many years of
experimenting in cooperation with engineers and manufacturer" of
aeroplanes.
I 9-wire strand stays.

Plates No.3 and No.4 give the strength of tIllS strand, also the
strength of same as stays using the thimble eye splice for terminal
connection, and judging from tests as given, tl1is connection is efficient, neat in appearance, and reliable.
P late No. 11 gives table of stay strength when the ends of the
strand are looped and soldered. The efficiency of this connection
is a maximum, but the use of acid and solder are objectionable, and
we believe the thimble eye splice with slightly lower efficiency is
preferable.

ARRON A UTICS.

We understand ?i-inch diameter strand is the largest diameter
used, but judging from present development larger diameter will
be required and It will be found that the thimble eye splice, also
the ends looped and soldered, will not give the same efficiency as
the diameter increases and we believe the use of sockets for %-inch
diameter and larger may be desirable.
Plate No. 10 shows two types of sockets.
For making terminal connection of strand in the field, we believe
the arrangement shown on plate No.9 is best, as it gives 90 per cent
efficiency and is readily attached by the average man and does not
require the use of acid, solder, or blow torch.
7 by 19 cord stays.

Plates No. 5 and No.6 show the 7 by 19 rope which is flexible,
elastic, and lends itself readily to thimble splice, giving ver.y uniform
efficiency and has the advantage of higher effiCIency for diameters
between % and Y2 inch.
We have determined by tests that the socket connection alone
gives higher efficiency than the thimble eye splice on 7 by 19 cord,
Dut as a general proposition believe the thimble eye splice is entirely
suitable for stay construction.
For a field connection plate No.9 shows the most suitable type.
CONCLUSIONS.

The tests as given show that it is possi.ble to furnish efficient
terminal connectIOns for wire, strand, and 7 by 19 cord, and eliminate
the use of acid, solder, and blow torch, and this report as a basis will
allow a more thorough investigation on similar lines.
We are unable to determine from aeroplane manufacturers why it
is necessary to use the solid wire, 19-wire strand, and the 7 hy 19 cord
for stays . It is self-evident. that the wire stay is less elastic than the
19-wire strand, also that the strand is less elastic than the 7 by 19 cord,
also the strength varies considerably, as can be determined by comparison of tables as given before, and to aUow a quick comparison we
give below:

American practice covers both the wire and 19-wire strand stay and
foreign practice requires the use of 7 by 19 cord for stay.
The table above shows h ow much more efficient the wire and strand
stays are for the same diameter and therefore we are led to b elieve
there are other considerations just as important as strength, such as
the elastic stretch of stays, flexibility and fatigue values of material

which may be governed by the construction of stay, and we believe
these points should be investigated under field conditions as well as
laboratory tests.
We hoped to give this report stress-strain diagram for the solid wi::e,
19-wire strand, also 7 by 19 cord, so that the modulus of elasticity
could be determined for any desired load and elastic stretch of stay
calculated for comparison. We were unable to complete our tests in
time, and therefore if you decide this is of value we will be pleased to
submit these diagrams and any other data developed. If vibration of
stays is a factor, the relative fatigue value of the three constructions
would give interesting data.
