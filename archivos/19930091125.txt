INTRODUCTION.

.

It has been shown in the analysis of the airplane radiator problem that it is necessary to
make measurements on—
(1) The core oharactmistics which ddne its nature.
1
(2) Heat diApated, as dependent on—
(a) Nature of core.
(b) Mass flow of air through the core.
(c) Density of the air.
(d) Water flow through the core;
(e) Temperat~ diifermoe betmeen the air and water.
“
(3) Power needed to lift the radiator and overcome its head resistance, as dependent
oIl—
(a) Nature of core.
(b) Air speed in the open.
(c) Air density.
(4) Mass flow of air through the core, as dependent on—
(a) Nature of the core.
(7)) Air speed in the open.
(5) Power needed to circulate water through the core, as dependeut on—
(a) Nature of the core.
(b) Rate of water flow.
Point (5) has been covered by Report No. 63, Part II, and is entirely distinct from the
others. The following paragraphs describe (a) the apparatus, @) the method of taking
obsmvat.ions, (c) the method of computing the results, for the first four.
Test Specbnens.
The specicmns tested for head resistance were plain SCICtiOM mre ~thout wat~ boxes or
of
other attachments. They varisd in size from approximately 6 inches square to approximatdy
12 inches by 24 inches and 16 inchee square.
Those tested for rate of heat dissipation were uniform in size and fittings. The cores were
8 inches square, with water boxes 1 inch deep, as shown in Fig. 1. The entrance and exit water
pipes were fitted onto brass tubing 11 inches deep and 1+ inches in diameter, which were inserted into each water box. Just inside the water box was a baffle of brass to equalize the
water flow through the oore.
(1) CORE CHARACTERISTICS.

.

The core charcteristica detmmined were:
(1) Dimensions of the water tubes, length (parallel to the direction of water flow), depth
(parallel to the direction of air flow), thickness (perpendicular to previous two), hydraulic radius
(ratio of area of a section perpendicular h the direction of water flow to its perimeter).
(2) Dimensions of air tubes, depth (same direction as depth above), and hydraulic radius.

OF THE WATER

TUBES.

The apparatus used to measure the m
secfiom.of the water tubes is shown in figure 2.
A radiator specimen, 1?, with water tubes i-i, wss placed upright On a support. Watir fiODIa.
graduated burette 13was admitted into the radiator @i[ the vmter level was a little way above
the entrance to the water tubes. Suppose this level was h,. This and the water level in the
burette 13were read. The cock Owas opened and watcu admitted to the radiator until another
level h was reached, when readings of the gauge and b~ette were taken again. W.@en, rom 6 to
f
10 diilercmttevels had been observed and a level & near the top of the specimen reached, the
l
btuette was moved to position 1 and readings taken while emptying the radiator.
The burette B“.tias calibrated by weighing its water content at ~~t
leve~. The fie
dividing engine of ijhe Division of W6ights pnd M&;ures was used to calibrate the gauge.
This was read (while taking observations) to. 0.01 cm.: and the yolwne to 1 cc.
Volumes in cc. were plotted against gauge levels -in cmq Wd the points found to lie on a
.m
straight line. If the slope of this line is denoted by m, the area of the water tubes by a, and the
area of the gauge by g, then since all the wa%r leaving the burette goes into the radiator and
gauge and raises th~ leyel of each by t~e same amount,

The constant g was determined previously by using in the gauge known volumes of water.
Two tests were made on each specimen. If theresulting values of a diflxed more than 3 per
cent, other tests were made. The number of water tubes was counted. The depth of the tubes
was measured with a rule and calipers. When the water tub~ wem not vertical, e. g., in the
hexagonal cell type+ the area above (which-is, of co_wp, the horizontal area) was projected
onto a plane normal to the direction of @e water flow. This projected area divided by the
number of tubes gave the area of one tube. A further division by the depth gave the thickness.
Twice the sum of the thickness and depth is the perimeter, and this divided into area gave the
hydraulic radius. The water-tube length in inches of a foot square section is 12/F, if F is the
above projection- factor.
a was expressed in square feet per foot. of core width, + thgt the water wntentmf the cmg
was 62.4 a, 62.4 being the density of water in pounds per cubic foot.
DIMENSIONS

OF THE AIR TUBES.

The method used in finding the cross sectional area of the air tubes was similar to the one
just described. The specimen was clamped face dowumto the top of a shalIow tank 7 inches
square and 2 inches deep. The rim of the tank was 1 inch broad and was faced with a strip
of soft rubber, so that the edge of the specimen was aeah?d water-tight. The tank contained
two openings to which rubber tubes could be attached, one leading to the burette and the other
to the gauge as before.
The observations and .computationa were exactly the same as in the case of the water tubes.
Micrometer measurements on the Wide of the air tubee and a direct count of their numbqr
determined the perimeter of the air tubes, and when combined with the area above, the hydraulic

radius also. These observations gave an independent value of the air-tube mea which agreed
well with the results of the above method.
The air-tube depth (identical with the core depth) was measured with a rule and calipers.
FREE AREA

OF THE Am

PASSAGES.

Since the specimens were seldom exactly 8 inches square, careful measurements of the true
frontal area were made and divided into the air-tube area to give the per cent of free area.
EXTEYT

AND

DISTRIB~TIOX

OF T’EE COOLING

-.

S’L’IWACE.

When the air tubes had a simple shape, circular, hexagonal, rectangular, etc., so that the
relation between the area and the perimeter was known, the air-tube measurements above
sufllced to determine the cooling surface, since this is the product of the perimeter of a tube by
the number of tubes by the core depth. (Note: A slight correction had to be made sometimes
on account of the enlargenumt at the edges.) Inspection of the radiator construction showed
what portion of the surface was direct, i. e., formed part of a -water tube or water box wall,
and what indirect, i. e., received heat from the water only by conduction along a metal fin of
some sort. (E. g., in a Harrison htmagonal cell type, two sides of each air cell formed part
of a water tube. Hence one-third of this part of the core was rated as direct surface and
two-thirds as indirect.) The edges viere all rated indirect.
With the irregular shapes, many different methods of solution were used, depending on
the nature of the irregulmity. Every eflort was made to determine these values to 2 per cat,
but in a few cases the values could not. be fixed with certainty to better thrm 10 per cent. TWO
observers worked independently and compared their results, so that large errors were not apt
to escape detection.

OF THE METAL.

All the specimens testecl were made of copper or brass, as determined b3-inspection. The
metal thickness was measured with a stage micrometer reading to 0.005 mm. The readings
howeyer, were not ~ery uniform, so the -i-dues ohttihled are not :Iccurflte to th~ltCIegree,e. g.,

This was determined by inspection and some rough measurements and sketched on the

(2) HEAT lXSSIP.4TED.
Two” distinct sets of memurc+nents were made on the heat dissipated and two dflerent
sets of tippmatus used. Both made use of 8-inch squtwe wind tunneIs and were made so that
the same specimen could be tested in both tunnels without ony dteratious. One tunnel was
inclosed in a tarik -which couid be partially eshmsted and used hot water to supply he~t to
the radititor. The other was an open tunnel in the room and suppliecl heat by meims of steam.

tank 5 feet long and 3 feet in diameter, This was suilickntly air tight to allow the maintenance
within it of a pressure of 30 m 40 cm. of Hg.
At the tunnel entrance a honeycomb of sbeeta.netal celIs, 1 inch square and 3 inches deep,
served to break up vortices and straighten the air flow. Following this in order came:
(1) A Pitot grid to measure ‘tie air speed.
(2) A resktance thermometer to measure the air temperature.
(3) A thermocouple grid to measure the rise in the air temperature as it paaaed
through the ra&tor.
(4) A piezometer ring to mea?wre the drop in_the static pressure of the air.
(5) The specimen under teat.
(6) The other piezometer ring.
(7) The other thermocouple grid.
(8) The fan.
(9) Conical guide vanes to deflect the air down the tank.
(10) A wet and dry bulb hygrometer to measure the humidity.
(11) A cold-water radiator to cool the heatad air.
Water flow was produced by a centrifugal pump driven by a belt from a one-horsepower
direct-current shunt motor. The water line is sketched in figure 5. The reskkance of the
heating coils to the water flo-wwas quite large comparml with the rest of the line, so that high
rates of water flow (above 11 gaIs./min.) could only be obtained by opening the by-pass mound
the heater. A thermostat maintained a constant temperature at the radiator inlet. Afte; the
heater followed in order:
(1) A Hg. thermometer to regulate the uerm~stat.
@) A set of thermocouples b measure the temperature drop in the water.
(3) The specimen under test.
(4) The other half of the therm~couple set.
(5) A Venturi meter to measure the watar flo~.
(6) A drain.
(7) A tank with a free water surface to open the sptem.
I
Construction and calibration qf th apparatus: The atiflow measurement oflered some
difficulty. A Thomas meter was first used for the purpose, butmwing to the high air speed and
very irregular velocity distribution, it proved very unsatisfactory and had to be discarded.
In its place was instded the Pitot grid. This contained 16 dynamic openingg, one at the center
of each 2 inch square section of the tunnel. All these opened into one tube leading to one
arm of an inclined water gauge. A piezonwter ring me@.red the static pressure and led to the
other side of the gauge. A piece of sheet copper was carefully inlaid in the tunnel for n distance
of 6$ inches, so that the air passed over a very smooth surface before remhing the piezometer
ring. Four square copper tubes were soldered onto the back of this ring 43 inches from its
entrance, at the point of the dynamic openings, Ab ~-inch intervals all around this, hole S
mm. in diameter were drilled. The burr was carefully scraped off the holes, and then the holes
were cleaned out and smoothed with a hand drill.
One of the inclined water gauges is shown in figure 4. Thwe were calibrated in .txwh
position by connecting them in parallel with’ a V tube containing light oil of a known density.
A zero reading (scale reading with zero pressure difference) -was taken before and aftar a run.
Both the zero and the calibration remained sensibly comtant over a period of many weeks,
A careful oxplomtion of the chame] tit various spmd,qover the range obtainable was m~de
with a stamdard Pitot. This Pitat was ‘moved about at 49 different points spaced regul~rly
over the channel and the velocity as indicated by it and tl~egrid mad. Ob.mrvations wcm ah

ring. This last varied slightly around zero, showing that the static pressure was constant across “
the channel within 3 per cent of the velocity head sought. When the velocity was integrated
over the channel it was found to agree within l+ per cent with the velocity indicated by the
Pitot grid at all speeds.
A barometer was connected with this piezometer ring so as to read directly the air pressure
at the P.itoti
The resistance thermometer was made in the form shown in figure 6. No. 40 nickel wiro
was used, inclosed in a 0.5 mm. copper tube. This wire was calibrated by the thermometer
section of the bureau and found to satisfy the following equation:

where e= E. M. l?. in millivolts when cold junctions were at 0° C. This E. M. 1?.was measured
by means of a Morris E. Leeds’ 15,000-ohm potentiometer, sensitive to 10 microvolt.
The static rings about the radiator were constructed exactly like” the piezometer ring
dw.ribed above, save that the copper ring was 2 inches long.
The Venturi -was connected to a mercury prawwe gauge and the “~hole contrivance cali-.
brated by weighing the water discharged through it in a known time.
A 10-foot gravity head was originally used instead of the prcissureof the pump to produce
the water flow through the radiator, but this was &carded because it did not give sticiently
high raiw of flow. The pipes were insulated with magnesia pipe lagging 1 inch thick.
Many metioda of arranging the thermocouples so as to measure accurately the temperat&e
drop in the water were tried before a successful one was found. A single couple in the inlet
and outlet pipe proved too erratic. Four cuuples in series in the center of the box itself failed
b give a good temperature integration besides giving such a small reading that it was much
affected by small thermal E. M. F.’s in the line. Twenty-one couples atraqged in three groups
of seven each, one in the center of the water box and one on each side, gave very good readings and a good temperature integration but proved too fragile .ti wi.@tand the hard Usage
received in changing specimens.
Finally 21 couples, about one-half inch apart, were incased in a copper tube in the form
of a spiral coil and placed in the inlet and outlet water pipes. These proved very .succesaful
in every respect.

The bridge used to read R was calibrated by the Electrical Division of the bfieau and the corrections found to be negligible. A rough calculation showed that the maximum error caused
by neglecting the lead resistance aiuounted to 0.15 C. This produced an error of ~0.2 per cent
in the result.
At fit an attempt was made to measure the temperature rise in the air through the
Thomas meter and through the radiator with 200 ohm rmistance thermometers in which insulated nickel wire was strung on a lattica work of iron tire.
Owing to Me varying stresses on
the wire caused by the air stream, the resistance changed so much as ta vitiata the measurements of small temperature dithrences (about 10 C.).
The thermocouple grids proved much more satisfactory. They each con&ted of 25
copper-constantan junctions spaced at equal intervals over the channel.
Calibration showed that they satisfied the following equation:

peratures to 0.05 C. A Pitot grid and two piezometer rings were installed just as in the inclosed
tunnel. k addition two other rings 7 inches from the radiator faces were used.
The barometer was in the room, so that obsemations had to be made on the pressure
difference between the air in the tunnel and in the room. This. was accomplished by opening
the low-pressure side of the pressure drop gauge to the air in the room.
A recording hygrometer regist~red the humidity with sufhient accuracy.
The heat dissipated by the radiator was supplied by the condensation of dry steam.
Figure 12 givw a sketch of the apparatus used to control and measure the steam flow. Steam
from the high-prwsure mains (100 lbs./in? was paseed through a valve where its pressure was
reduced to about 10 lbs./in.z. A V-shaped pipe yith an opening at the bottom drained out most
of the water. The steam passed on through a coil where it was superheated about 500 C.,
through a plug cock where its pressure fell to atmospheric, through a separator where a mercury thermometer recorded its temperature, through the radiator specimen where most of it
condensed and through another separatir out of which the water dropped into a -weighingtank.
Originally a thermometer was inserted in the lower water box of the specimen, but the
water temperature was found to dMer so slightly from the temperature of condensation that
the heat lost by the water in cooling could be shly neglected. . A fan blew the steam away
from the tunnel. The steam he was insulatad in the same manner as the water line in the
other tunnel. The radiator specimen was insulated on the sides with cork board one-half inch
thick. The water boxes were not so well protected, but on account of the small surface exposed
and the comparatively quiet air in contact with them, the heat lost thus could not have been
more than a few tenths of a per cent at moderate speeds. In fact, in some of the early experiments, the steam condensed when the channel was blocked so no air flow existed was measured
and found to be less than 1 per cent of the total.
Method of 068erving.—The exhaust valves in the steam line were opened, the water drained
off and the blower started. When the water was out of the line and the steam flowing well,
the gas heater was lighted, and the blower adjusted to give the desired speed. After steady
conditions of steam flow and temperature had been attained, one observer set the bahi.nce
dightly ahead of the actual weight and started a stop-watch when the pointer crossed the
zero line. The balance was set ahead of the weight (from 1 to 10 pounds, according to the probable rate of condensation), and one observer frorn then on recorded steam temperatures. At
the same time the other observer read the gauges and the air temperature. A set of readings
was taken at reagular
intervals (everyone or two minutes, according to the duration of the run).
About a fiute
before the assigned weight was reached, a bdl warned the observera, who
prepared to obeeme the time when the pointer crossed the line again. At each speed two or
three runs were taken as a check. The time interval employed was from three to six minutes,
and could. easily be measured to 1 second. The balance weighed correctly to 0.01 pound. An
observation sheet (fig. 13) is reproduced.

sticed to determine(1) Pressure drop in the air through the radiator.
(2) Rate of air flow.
(3) Heat given up by the steam.
Pressure drop.—This result was computed as in the other tunnel with one addition.
Because the piezometer rings were 7 inches from the radiator, (1) was corrected by subtracting
from it the pressure drop in 14 inches of unobstructed channel.
Ah Jozo.-The computation was the same se before. ~

“The measurements needed” to. dete%ne this quantity were made in a tunnel whose cross
section was large compared with the dimensions of the radiator tested, in contradistinction to
the heat measurements, which were all made in bil.khead tunnels. Figure 15 shows a sketch
,“
of this large tunnel.
It was of octagonal section, 54 inches in inside diameter. The enixying.air passed through
a honeycomb of sheet metal cells, 3 inches in diameter and 12 inches deep, through a straight
section of 25 feet long, and out through a conical d.itkser. A four-blade propeller fan dri~en
by a 75-horsepower direct-current motor drew air through the tunnel. A continuous speed
range from 15 to 90 miles per hour could be obtained by adjustummk provided by rh60stats in
both field and armature and two voltages, 110 and 240. A Pitot tube read on an inclined water
gauge measured the air speed to 1 per cent.
The head resistance was measured directly on a balance, figure 16. This was mounted a little
below the floor of the tunnel, and consisted es.sentially.of a bell crank suspended by thin flexible
steel strips, with a horizontal arm on which weights could be hung below the tund, and a
vertical arm passing up through the tunnel floor tQsupport the specimen. A second vertical arm
extended below the fulcrum and carried counterpoises for lowering the center of gravity, and a
second short horizontal arm with adjustable counterpoises provided a zero adjustment. The
joint at the tunnel floor was rendered air-tight by an ofi trap. The vertical arm that supported
the spechnen was extensible, -and-wasfitted at the top with a detachable brass block. This was
screwed h a plate ~ inch or Ices in thidm-,
soldered to the lower side of the specimen under teat.

OAIJBRATION

OF APR4RATU19.

The tunnel crom section was explored with a movable Pitot and found to be uniform within
1 per cent at all points more than 8 inches from the wall. Silk threads strung from a fine vertictd
wire showed that there were considerable disturb.arums
&the air s$rmrn ti the neighborhood Of
the specimen, but no appreciable ones within 8 inches ol the tmel wall. This was taken to
indicate that the tunnel was large enough to give free air conditions.
The balance was calibrated by applying known horizontal forces to the vertical arm and
observing the balancing forces on the horizontal arm. This gave the correct factor by which
to multiply the balance reading, for different lengths of the vertical ~ml to obtain the true force.
ordinarily a length was chosen which made this factor qnity, so that the force was read directIy.
Method Of okrvhg. —The radiator specimen (without water boxes) was mounted on the
vertical arm and the distance from its center lx--the fulcrum adjusted to the desired value. To
find the position of no yaw, a specimen was set at various angles, the position of minimum head
resistance assumed to repr~ent zero yaw, and a reference point marked on the tunnel wall by
sighting across the front .of the radiator. The same result could be obtained by sighting through
the radiator tubes at the honeycomb at the tunnel tmtranti. In “other cases, the angle of yaw
was measured roughly by sighting across the front of the section at a scale mounted on the
tunnel wall. Because of fluctuations in the air speed, two observers took simultaneous readings on the balance and Pltots, since there was no sensible lag between the two instruments. ”
Nine points were usually observed.

OY?AIR THROUGH THE CORE.

PRELIMINARY

ATTEMPTS.

Three different methods were tried for measuring the mass flow of air through the core
before a satisfactory one was found.
(1) A careful and persistent attempt was made to measure the flow with a small Pitot
tube behind the core, and in positions ran=ging
from -wellwithin the cell to a few inchw behind
the core, but it appeared to be out of the question to use a Pitot tube in the turbulent air
encountered.
(2) Threads were attached to the rear edges of the radiator to define the stream, in the
hope that the air passing through the core could be followed to a position where the flow would
not be too turbuIent for the use of a Pitot tube, and that in such a position it would be possible
to measure the velocity, end the area of cross section of the air that had passed through the
core. But it was found that, even aside from the difficulty introduced by the tendency of the
pti on the threads to straighten them, so that they would not truly follow the streamline, the
flappihg of the threads was too great, and consequently their position too inddnite to allow
of measurement of the area incIuded betwwm them.
(3) A hot-wire anemometer was tried, and gave promise of very fair redts, but before
it had been thoroughly tried out, a simphm-method was discovered and the use of the instrument was discontinued.
A3?3?AR.ATU8 USED.

The method finally adopted employed a specialIy constructed Venturi, a longitudinal
section of which is shown in figure 17. The cyLindxical throat and the two mnes were made
up from shtwt copper soldered together, and the joints filed down into curves of stream-Iine
form. A copper tube led out from a single small needle hole in the side of the throat. A
piece of sheet iron bent into cylindrical form was soldered over the con- extending from la
inches before the front cone nearly to the rear and ~d covering the central contracted portion,
which would &e cause considerable resistsnce to the air stream. A second needle hole before
the front cone was connected to a small tube which ran back along the outer surface, and turned
up where it reached the tube coming from the throat. h inclined water gauge measured
the prmsure difference. Three wires soldered to the sides of the Venturi passed through the
cds of the radiator, and were bent over in front so as to fasten the Venturi ilrmly in place
behind the radiator.

CALIBRATION

OF THE

FOR AFJ30NAUTSCS,

VENTURI.

Tests in the inclosed tunnel with eight diilerent sections of widely differing types of core
gave nearly the same pressure difference for same air flow through the tunnel and this was very
close to that given when no radiator at all was used. For ordfiary typm of core this was tmi
within about 3 per cent and with cores in which the air flow was very much obstructed within
6 per cent. No high degree of accuracy is claimed for this, but it was very convenient and
sufficient for the purpiae.
A calibration curve was obtained by running the Venturi in the open in the large wind
tunnel against the Pitot tube of the tunnel, The square root of the Venturi pressure dMerence (in gms./cm2) was plotted against the mass flow as Nomputed from the tunnel Pitot. “l%is
is the product of the airspeed in feet sec. by d, (.0750 Ib.l’ft.a). The resulting curve was very
,ffat, almost linear. Sii calibrations at W3erent tim~ during i period of six months gave
fdentical curves.
NoTE.—This calibration was in terms of mass.~w k.. pounds per second per square foot
of Venturi mouth, and hence mass flow through raihators N per square foot frontal-core tires,
and not of air-tube area,
.Method
of 068??%?2$ —The specimau under observ~~ion was moupted in the 54-inch wind
tunnel in the same manner as for head resistance nmammmer&i, the Venturi was attached
to the rear face, its pressure tubes connected to an inclined water gauge by means of tubes
passing through a hole in the tunnel floor, and simultaneous readings taken of its pressure
difference and the air speed in the tunnel. These readings were taken at from 9 to 15 different
speeds for each radiator.
Method of ccmpu$hg.-!llhe Venturi gauge reading was multiplied by the gauge factor to
obtain grams per cmz. The square root of this was computed and used as ar~ment tO det~rmine the mass flow from the calibration curve. The mass flow was then plotted against V,
for each radiator.
h in the case of the head resistance, the actual a~ density was not needed, ‘NM reason
for this is slightly difYerenthowever. The Vetituri really meaiium velocity, just as the Pitot,
so that- relation between its readinga and those of the Pitot tubes furnish a measure of the
ratio of the amount of air going through the radiator to the amount that would pass through
that section if the radiator were absent. It seems permissible to assume that this ratio is
independent of the air density, because the viscosity is known to be independent of the den”tity,
and its effect in this case is not large anyway,
