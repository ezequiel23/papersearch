PERFCU?MANOEOF A .lMJE-DR~EN GEAR~-By
R. H. Heald,
Bureau of Stsadards.
The maintenance of an adequate and uniform supply of fuel for
an aeronautical engine during flight iS ~
tion in airplane design.

imPort~t considera-

In order to eliminate the uncertainty

involved in feeding directly from the supply tank to the engine,
the gasoline is frequently pumped upward to a smaller tank located
within the upper wing fra which it flows by gravity to the engine
carburetor. The pump maybe

driven either (1) by the eng~~

rectly, or (2) by some type of wind @ee~
‘tobe in the relative air stre~

or rotor m-ted

during flight.

di-

so ~

The purpose of

this paper is to present the results of a test on a pumping unit
of the lattez type.
The test was conducted in the high speed wind tunnel at the
Eurem

of Standards on an Aeromarine Plane & Motor Corporation pump.

The driving unit consists of four hemispherical metal CUPS,
2 3/4 inches in dismeter, mounted on a spider, the hub of which
is threaded to take the connecting shaft of the pump.

The unit

may be mounted on the airplae so as to be either entirely in the
air stream (Fig. 9) or partially enclosed in a sheet metal housi~
(Fig. 8).

METHOD OF TESTING.

Wind Tunnel Test of Delivery.
Meapur,ementsof the quantity of fuel delivered per minute
were made at varims

wind speeds, (1) with the housing in plaoe

and (2) with the vanes entirely eqosed

to tbe wind stream.

Fig. 8 shows the mountjmg of the apparatus with the housing in
plaoe.

The mountjng with the housing removed is shown in Fig. 9.

The wind speeds mere determined fTom Pitot tube measu~ements, SS-

i

suming a-standard density of .00123 gins/cm .

Kerosene having a specific gravity of .817 was used in place
of gasoliriethroughout the test, because of the necessity of mpunting the p~

in proximity to the switchboard c~trolling the wind

tunnel motOr.
The delivery of the pump when equipped with the wind-vane
housing (Fig. 8) was measured at the wind speeds of

~,

80, 100

and 120 miles per hour, under the followi.ng
conditions:
(a) With a constant intake head but with different di~~haxge heads,

different length of discharge hose,

(d)

With a constant head and hose -lengthbut with elbow. ..-.
equipped hose nipples or a %ee equippeu witn nose
nipples, attached to the end of the discharge hose.

The delivery of the pmp

;
I

was also determined with the vanes

not enclosed for various discharge heads (Fig. 9). The rotational
speed of the pup

with constsnt discharge head and hose length,

both with snd without enclosed vanes was also me=ured

for dif-

ferent wind speeds.
In all the tests the radii of the hose bends were fixed and
the lengths of both t~

intake and discharge hose were maintained

ccmstant, except when determining the effect of the length of hose
on the delivery of the pump.

The bore of the rubber hose used in

this test was 3/8 inch. The hose layout is shown in Fig. 10.
Test of Efficiency of Pump.
The efficiency of the pump was determined by driving it directly with a one-fourth 3P~ 220 volt, D.C. shunt motor.

Measure-

ments were made of the power supplied to the motor when running
without losd. The pump was then connected to the motor by means
of a short extension shaft and the hose arranged so as to give conditions identic~ with those given in Table 1.

As in the wind

tunnel test, the amount of oil delivered by the pump was determined
by weighing. At the same time, the electrical input to the motor
.
and the rotational speed of the pump were determined.

,

Head Resistance of the Vanes.
In measuring the heed resistance Of the vanes, the bearing
supporting them was mounted directly on the end of an upright stT:...

-4of streamline form.

The strut extended thr~h

the tunnel so tl..

the lower end projected below the tunnel floor and was supported
by a lmife-edge mounted on the floor of the tunnel.
arm camying bite

A vreig-hing

edge and weighing psn was attached to the lower

end of the strut at right sngles to it and pointing up-stream.
Suitable weights for counterbaacing

were also provided. The pump

was mounted on the strut outside of the tunnel and was connected
to the driving vanes by means of the extension shaft. The hose
was arranged fok a discharge head of two feet using a three-foot
length of hose on the disch~ge
length on the intake side.

In measuring the head resistance of the vines when enclosed
in the housing, it was necessary to modify somewhat the arrangement just described. The housing was ~laced h

the side of the

tunnel as for the delivery test (see Fig. 8], and the balance was
supported frcm the floor of the rem.

Measurements were made of

the head resistance of the vanes, “
with both the enclosed snd unenclosed mounting for a range of wind speeds of frcm 20 to 120
miles per h-.

Measurements were also

m~e

of

of a single vane pro jeoting into the thnel

The delivery of the unit is proportional to the wind speedt
The notational speed of the pump shaft is also proportional to
the wind speed.

The resistance of a tee is equal approximately to that of a

Assuming the pump delivery to be the same for gasoline as for
kerosene and assuming the fuel consumption of the engine to be 0.55
pounds per brake hozsepcmer per hour, the pump with the “vanes in
the housing would deliver fuel for 16-W ‘~.-p. at an air speed of

-7Resistante and Power Oharacteristics~
The power required for driving the unit with the vanes unenclosed at a speed of’”20 m.p.h. is pearly 2 HP, while with the
1
vanes in the housing the power required is slightly more than
one-’tif horsepower.

Fig. 5 and Table 3 give the values found for

the head resistante of the vanes and the power required at the va~
ious wind speeds and eriiphas the advsntage to be obtained by enize

The efflcienoy of the vanes is readily determined by

dividing the combined efficiency of the unit by the efficiency of

The results are summarized in Table 5> and the OUzves

are given in I?igs.6 and 7.

These results again illustrate the decided advantage to be
obtained by shielding the oonvex sides of the vanes from the air
stream by some form of hausing.

At a wind speed of 60 m.p.h. the

efficiency of the vanes is increased from 2% to 21fiby the use of
the housing, with a consequent incre~e

in the combined efficiency

of the unit from 0.1 to 0.7 percent.
The unit

is

working at a low efficiency thz~hout

of airplane speeds.

the range

With the vanes in the housing the combined

efficiency ranged from 0.7 to 0.2 percent for speeds from 60 to
120 m.p.h.

The efficiency of the pump in this xange is from 3 to

1 peroent.
The efficiency of the pump is also very low.

Some improve-

ment may possibly be obtained by increasing the side of the cutlet
pipes.
