(Weight 740 kg.; area 10 sq.m.; Gnome 160 HP.)
From an examination of Pl.B.43 the following conclusions

may be cirawn:
1st.

The

laborato~y

test 6ives for the Borel-Boccaccio

a resistance 50% greater than th~ true resistance.

This, as

I have shown else ',-vhere) * is due to the fact that in tests
made in existing

labora~ories,

is from 15 to 25 times

~ess

the

Reyn(~ds

number realized

than that of the plane in free

flight, and that, consequently, the struts of the rigging
and undercarriage have a resistance on the model 5 times as
great as on the full scale machine) w
hile the increase of resistance for the other parts of the machine vary betv.een 100
and 200%.

If the Reynolds number involved is rather high,

it is perfectly useless to test a model in an existing laboratory.
2nd.

The classification of the

~aohines

Borel, Nieuport,

Spad and Verville seems to be quite logical when w consider
e
that the resistance of the Nieuport \/as greater than that of
the Borel because it had an additional cabane; that the resistance of the Spad was greater than that of the Nieuport
because of its radiator placed forwfrrd,**and that the Verville
having the same load per horsepo1l7er and pe r square meter as

* See It France-Aviation , It December 1919 .
** The Spad has lately beaten the speed record (309 km/hr) by
almost entirely masking the radiator with a large panshaped screen and suppressing the wind-screen of t he cockpit, the pilot's seat being moved further back in the
fuselage.

- 11 4. - REFLECTIONS ON FUTURE REGULATIONS FOR HIGH SPEED TESTS.

Now that :B'rance has d.efinitely won the Gordor. . -Bennett Cup:
people are wondering how fu'ture High S:;:>eed Tests will be regulated.

l,Jany are those who t:!.link that it is time to aot as was

done in Automobile

"Races~

and abanQon the formula of absolute

1 iberty under which the Gordon-Bennett Cup was contested, im-

posing certain

r~strioti?ns

on the machines, though they will

still be classifieci according to !spee" l..
'd

Especially it has

been suggested either to limit the power of the engine, the
load per square meter of the machine, or to fix a minimum landing speed.
PERSONALJ~Y,

I THINK THAT PERFE;CT LIBE:.:tTY S30ULD BE ALLOW-

ED, and this for the folloiting reasons:
1st.

In

orde~

to increase speed, it is not sufficient

to increase engine pOwBr; the Verville, with a 550 HP engine,
did not fly any faster than -che I-Heuport, for the twc machines
had the same load per horsepower and per square meter and certainly the structural resistances of the Verville (very large
fuselage, la.rge undercarriage) were in ·che same ratio to those
of the Nieupo:ct as the power of their respective engines.

The

Verville weighed almost twioe as much as the Nieuport: 1450 kg.
for the former and 870 kg. for the latter.
A machine, however, ,,·,hieh might have beaten the French
Nieuport, was the English Nieuport vVith an ABC engine of the
same power, but which allowed of a more harmonious fuselage
without radiators and a gain of 70 kg. in weight on the engine
set.

2nd.

As s lready remark8d, an increase in the load per

square n:eter does not necessarily lead to inc:rease of speed;
this is an incxpli0ab1e fact, but tt is a fact.

As the opti-

rr,um load per s qua l'e :r,ete=, ivnich, for the Ni euport

J

seems to

be 67 kg/m 3 , does not leac. to dange:rous landing speeds, the re
is no reason, for the present, why it should be limited .

Those

who w
