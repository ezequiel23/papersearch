ZWX)RYOF LIFTINGSURFACES

PART 1.

RESUME
A. GENERALBASES OF THE TEEORY.
The prcbleinf the flow of a flui~ about a liftingsufaoe
o
of infinitespan was solvedsome time ago for certainof theseprofiles by takingas a basisfor the det8ZTXIiI%3tiOZI lift the fo~of
lowingformulaof Kutta-Joukow$ki:
A=~V]~
where A is the lift,V the velocityof the fluid to infi~itude,

the CSRCULATIONOFTHE VEWOITY,

‘lhis
way of examiningthe problemnecessarily assumes the
existenceof a polytropic
funotionof the speedpotential. But if we
wish to treat the problemof

the

permanentflow of a fluid about a

surfaceof fixed spari,e must admit the existezmeof vortexesin
w
the ourrent. As smatter of faot, accordingto the theoryof Stokes,
the circulation
along a olosedcontourmoving in a fluid remains
constant. Now, if a closedoontoursurrounding
awing leavesit by
slippingalong the wing itself,the circulation
alongthis co~to~s
which had a certainvalue so long as the contoursurrounded

must b8 nullified;
therefore
