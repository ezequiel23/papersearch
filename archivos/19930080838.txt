In conducting tests on aerofoil models at the Langley
Memo rial Aeronautical Laboratory, the technical staff of
the Natio nal Advisory Committee for Aeronautics have

d ~ v~s~d

the follo;ving conve nient and accurate method. of aligning
the wing c hord with the air flow.
This device has been developed to permit rap id and a c curate alignment of aerofoils and models

narrow mirror clamped to the c110rd of the aerofoil, fron:
