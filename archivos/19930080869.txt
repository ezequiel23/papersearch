Slotted Wing .Sections,
By C. Laclmann of Ilarmstadt.

Introduction.
The idea of increasing the lift of an aerofoil ‘JYsubdividing
it goes back to gliding flight experiments by the writer before the
war.

A crash in August, 1317, with a ihmpler C airplane, on account ~

of stalling, caused tineidea to be put into concrete form and presented for a patent in 1918. The patent claim rssds:

“SuppOrting

surface characterized by Zts being divided into a number of tsndem
components which-together form a wing section.II The application
‘wasat first rejected ‘aec”ause
the patent office did not believe in
the possibility of increasing the lift by dividing the wing.

The

issuing of the Fatent was made dependent on conelu.sve proof of
i
,.

such incre~e.
Already in 1917, a small wooden model of a divided wing was
made in the laboratory of the school for observers in Cologne (Fig.
q

1).

This model was expeoted to show the effect of the slots ~on the

air current, with the aid of a smoke bl,~t.

The ratiler
primitive

-2exj?eriments
gave however no note-worthyresults, chiefly because ihe
610ts were too p.aryow.
lhrther experiments were rendered impossible by my war serrice
a6 airplsne pilot and subsequent severe wounding, and Sy inzensim
professional work after the war.

,

The announcezzent the practical experiments of Handle~-P~e
of
in 1920~ with a divided wing section, gave occasion for cslling the
attention of the prcfess%onal world and the patent offioe to the
German priority of the idea. The principal proof lay i~ the two
models made according to the instructions of the writer and tested
in the wind tunnel cf the aerodynamic institute at G&tingen.
The results of these experiffients here given.
are

Attention shouid

first be called to t~.efact, however, that the results obtair.ed
do
not yet represent the practically attainable opti~mm~ since the arrangement of the slots was only tentative, without theoretical considerations~ =d with the.closest possible adherence to the patent
drawing.

Any analytical investigation of the air current appears

extremely complicated. The inorease in the lift values of the di.
vialedwing &rely bears s“omerelation’to the changes in the air
current, since t-nediversion of t-nestresm lines from the suction
side of the section and the formation of a I’dead-water
regionftccur
o
at larger angles of attack than in the case of the closed wing
ssction.
For showing the effect on the current, a three-part wing section was tested in the hydraulic laboratory of the I!armstadtTechnical High School. The blaok walnut model was 45 x 25 cm., and was
I

instailed at an angle of attack of abo’~t40° in the 40 c~. wide conduit, which was inclosed on one side by a thick gl~s

piate.

The

average velocity of tb.ewater was 1 meter pe~ s~cond- The course
@f the s tre~l

~ines

cculd be recognized by the air bli~-olesn the,
i

water and could be made still plainer by admitting a solution of
ursnine through a smll

pipe.

.

When the slots were open, the

streamlines ran parallel to the cu-rveof the suetion side-

When

the slots were closed, there was a visi-~lelocsening of the streamlines on the upper side of the wing section. The cour~~ of the
variable layer and the formai,
ion of the tur-ouienidead-water region.
showed very plainly, wher~a strip of linen loosely covering the upper side, wss attached to the leading edge.
.

The loosening of the

Stremlines from the suetion side and ihe formation of the deadwater region also took place with the slots Gpen, when the velocity
of the water was raised to 4 rtieterser second. These experiments
p
are not yet finished and the stream pictures thus far obtained can
not pass for absolutely cor~ect representations.
Significance of Form snd Number of Siots.
Wing section No. 422 was chosen as the baa ic section for su3aivisioi in the G&t ingen experiments. In Figs. 2 and 3 are given
the polar diagrams derived frw

the results of the measurements.

For comparison, the polar curves of the basic section are given on
‘ootlz
diagrams. Model L-2 corresponds to model L-1, even to the
sharp edges of the o’~tet oper.ngs on the suetion sids. This was
l
i
.

siqly for exact conformity of the ex~eriment model with the draw- ing of the patent.

-4As may he seen froa the disgrams, the result of the division
is a mxdmm

lift increase of about 60~~for angles of attack whit-n

are about twice aslarge as foy closed wing s9ctions. Fig. 4 shows
that a cieoreaseof the lift-drag ratio occurs ~ iti=l

with the more UnifOrm

Of

the slots of section La,

for which

with the centinuity condition), the increase of the veicc- ;

ity of the current takes place in a more harmonious manner than for
secticm

L1.

lTelearn from this that in actual construction, tha

continuity of path of the acceleration$ aside from the centrifugal
accelerations, which are grasped with difficulty, is 3est tested
graphically.
From the curve diagrams of the G&t ingen measurements forsingle-slotted wings, it is evident that, with tuneupper outlet completely closed, the wing-section drag, within.cartain small angles ,
of attack, is nearly equal to the drag of a closed section. The irregular shape of the pressure side accordingly plays i~Orole with
these small sngles of attack, which is important in the construction
of slot-closing devices.
The’shapes of ths individual parts of the wing section,
‘2:’ are still very unfavorable.

LI and

In particular, these parts are tco

thick in proportion to the choxd. The w:dth of the slots also
s~e~s to be tOo narrcw.

The G&t ingen curves icr single-slotted

wing sections give an idea

the importance of more favorable

shaFes“for the slots and parts of the wing section.
The differences of tke experimental.results so far obtained
between wing sections with only one slot and those having two or
more may he summarized as fOllows:
1.

Wing sections with two ox r~oreslot~ give grsater lift

values thsn t-hosewith only one s1otj
2.

The course of the polar ourves is continuous for wing sec–

tions witk .
two or more slots> while for sections with OPIY one.s.iot
a sudden increase of tile Clw values occurs in the region of smsil
angles of attack;
3.

The pressure q
center varies more fOr large anglesof attack

in sections wit’ntwo or more slots than in sections with only cne
slot.
The question of the signifio~ce of the angle of setting of

the part sections to the chord of the tGtal wing secticm and the relation between the width of the slots and the velocity of the fluid

With Reference to a Mean fiselageDrag.
The above considerate
icns are of pure theoretical significance,
sinee in practice we always have to reckon with a fuselage drag and
can only fiy with regard to safety and not to the maximum weight
I per horsepower. By the introduction of a mean fuselage drag, the
matter assties an entirely different espect. The msmuM

the maximum value of seotio~ 422 by about 6$. l?Or reasons already

If, however, tile

of the closed section is chosen for the divided

The divided seotion accordingly works more favorably than the
qlosed section for F.ighweights per horsepower, high wing loading
and relatively low speeds. Since the speed in horizontal flight
also increases in pro~or%icn to the wing loading> the influence of
the slots on the horizontal speed must be determined befoze ap@y ing the rule to a practical example.
III.
Alteration of the Flight Speed by Mesns of the Slots.
The previous considerations apply to divided wing sections
without closing devices.

It is evident that the application of

such a device would serve the pu~ose

of combining the advantages

of both kinds of sections. With constant weight per horsepmer,
decrease in the speed can-be effected by opening the slots.

G&t ingen Tests “of Handley-Page Wings,
By C. Wieeelsberger.

The following preliminary series of twelve experiments was
carried cut at a wind velocity of 30 ueters per second for the purpose of investigating the characteristics of the Handley-Page wings.
1.

Testing a ning of the usual Hamiley-Page skape, so far as

the latter is known from the published reports concerning wing No. 1.
The experiment shows that the lift increases up to ~

aUgle of at-

tack cf 27.7°, the fiaxiriium
lift being here 196.3 (Fig. 1 smd Table

,

.

l). - From the posi~icm of the parabola of the induced drag,.~11ch
j
is drawn for the aspect ratio of 100.3 : 22.9, it is evident that
the wing section drag is not excessive fOr large angles o~.atta,ck.
Cn the other hand, for small angles of attack (in tke neighborhow

of a lift of 40), a strong sudden increase of the wing drag

takes place.

The wing, therefore, does riotshow especially favor-

able characteristics for normal flight, but very favorable, on the
contrary, for landing.
2.

It was sought to render the sudden increase ‘ofdrag for

small lifts 18ss unfavorable.

For this purpose, starting with a

previously tested wj.ngsection, No. 2a (Fig. 2), the e~~eri~lent

of the air, while retaining the share (section No. 2). With this

The measurements show (Fig. 2 and Tables 2

shown for wizngNo. 1.

In other respects the properties were in-

jured for large angles of attack, since cm the one hand the drag

was.increased snd on the other hand only a zasximun:

~~~ain~d.

The auxiliary wings were tested in three differen% posi-

tions (Fig. 3, wings 3a to 3c). The me~urement

for 3b, as was to

be expected: shows favorable properties for normal flight, whila
3c gives a greater lift.

Position 3a, which was first tried, ‘is
.
oonsidezably less favorable than 3c. The O1OSing of the slot in
the arrangement 3c, as indicated in Fig. 3 (the measurement curve
being designated by 3d), gives quite nomal

results with small and

mediu, lifts. Lifts, drags and moments of curvss 3a to 3d,

all given for the sake of better comparison, with reference to the
same wing chord of 23 cm. The moment center is the leading edge
of the main wing (Figs. 3 and 4 ad
4.

Tables 4-7).

The auxiliary wing, as shown in Fig. 5, was made rotatsble,

so that the slot between its rear edge and the main wing could be
adjustea at different widths. The auxiliary wing zotated about an
axis passing through the point

is derived.

19

If the slot is opsned by rotating the auxiliary wing

more and more, the maximum lift is attained with a slot of 3 mm.
The maximum lift is however not so great here as in some arrangements of the first and third series of experiments. The reason
for this last phenomenon may, however, under certain circumstances,
be due to the less fa~~orable
position of the auxiliary wing with
reference to the main wing. For calculating the dimensionless
.
coefficients, the chord of the original section (20 cm.) was employed.
It may be seen from the foregoing data that a very high ma%imum lift can be”obtained by utilizing an auxiliary wing in the
proper position.

On the other hand, there occurred in the field

of the angles of attack for normal flight, a strong, sudden inCrease of drag whioh could only be eliminated by changing the position of the auxiliary wing br by closing the slot.

Experiments with Slotted Wings,
By R. Katzmayr and L. Kirste of Vienna.

a

About a year ago there appeared the first announcement of 2.
which was
new “tiing,
made by the English firm of Hanciley-Page,
claimed.
to have considerably greater lift for a given speed.

On.

account of the &sucity of information, an arrangement 1ike F lg. 1
was first tested, that is~ a narrow auxiliary wing was added in
frOnt Of the regular wing so as to leave a slOt.

Later experi-

fientswere tried with two such wings (Fig- 2 ) a.n~finallY with the
whole wing divided like a window shutter (Fig. 3). The experiments were periorued partly in the wind tunnel ad partlY m
airplane. The results showed that an increase h

The theoretical foundation for such a lift in~rexe had ~tfahrt 1S20, p.175).

Accord-

wtig increases

of the wing, as the result of a

sort of I!
Venturi action.fl According to another theory, the region
of str~gly

diminished pressure is extended further back.

In order t o verify the previously published data and also obtain a general view of the phenomena produced by divided wings,
two series of experiments were carried out in the aerodynamical
laboratory of the Technical High School in Vienna.

-2i3-

First a normal sjlapedwing which was or~hand, 900 x 150 mm.
(Fig. 4), was tested in the wind tunnel.

The e.xpeimer.ts

were per-

iozmed under a pressure of 20 mm. of water !2 grsus per square centimeter) and included angles of attack from 0° to 27°-

The lifi

drag were measured and also, for corroborate
ion, the lift-drag

The original wing was first subjected to the air current in
zhe wind tunne1 and then the cuts shown in Fig. 4 were made with a
circular saw and the wing was egain subjected to the air current.
The cuts extended clear through the section from the top to the
Jottom, narrow connections being left only on the edges of the wing

The lift increase is dretiy

of the corresponding lift values, while above 18° the lift’constantly increased in comparison wi&& that of the ori~nal wing.
This phenomenon is due to the favorable effect of slot

c.

It

may ~e further gathered from the diagrams that the values for the
pairs of slots can be obtained frou the values for the single
slots by addition, and that consequentljj
the slots exert no mutual influence on one another.

This.also holds true when all

three slots are open, as s~own in Fig. 6.

,
For answering the question as to how the slots affect the
distribution of the press-ue on the wing, the static

pressure

on

the upper side of the wing was measured, for different angles of
attack, in the midcile

of

the span, at five points of the wing

section marked in Figs. 7a and 7b.

The results are reproduced

h

Fig. 7a for the original wing, and in Fig. 7b for the wing with
slot

c.

It is accordingly tevident that, with the conduction of

the excess pressure to the top of the wing, especially for large
angles of attack, an increase of the partial vacuum cccurs over
t-herear half of the wing and the pressure on the botto~ is only

The greatest increase in the uaximum lift took place with
a =28mm.,

as shorn by Fig. 8.

For this case and for’the wing

aior:e,Fig. 9 gives the two Fclars, smi Table 2 gives tF.ecorresponding values.

It is evident t-hatthe lift diminishes for smali

[

-32-

smgles of attack smd first shows a definite gain above 12°.

The

lift-ckragnatios are considerably pooi’erfor all positions of the
auxiliary wing, es s“nownin Frig.8.
In order to answer the question as to how the lift is increased the pressure distribution was measured, as in the first
seriss of experiments> for the wing alone aridfor tae position
a = 28nm.,

according to Figs, 10a and 10b. A fu-ther extension

of the diminished pressure region toward the zear was not noticeable, but only an increase on the fore part of the wing.
As the final result of both series of experimentss the influence of the ‘~auxiliary
wing!!is quite different from that of the
slot, as is evicientfrom a comparison of the diagrams. Both
met-nodstiprove the lift values, but the auxiliary wing does so
While the latter’seriously decreases
to a far greater de~ee.
.
the lift-drag ratio, a slot c near the trailing edge3 somewhat
improves

it.
