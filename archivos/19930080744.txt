SIMPLE MEANS FOR SAVING FUEL ON TRAFFIC · FLIGHTS. *
By
E. Kook,
Many of the :war airplane s are not suitable for traffic·, because they have been one-sidedly developed for definite war
purposes (climbing, for e~ple, and flyin~ at high altitudes)
and are incapable of rendering traffic service with eo·onomy of
~Uel.

The latter qualificati on was considered important only

for airc-raft, like seaplanes, requiring a large radius of action.
The follow.ing experiments are intended to show how e»isting airplanes; Quilt for war

p~rposes,

can, by simple means, re ···

duce their fuel consumption and thus become better adapted, for
traffio purposes,

The experiments described were performed at

the seaplane experiment stati on at Warnemunde, and. with the
ex.ce.pt ion of some of those de scribed.. in Sect ion I, were conducted
by the· author,
I. Flying with Throttled Engine.
By · flying with/" throttled engine a.'1d at less than the maximum

flying speed, the fuel consumption is greatly reduced in proportion to the distance· flown.

Regarding the amount of this reduc-

tion, no exact data · have thus far been available.

Similar results were also obtained with

For economy pf engine power alone, throttling is disadva..-rltageous~

since the specific consumption

creases with the decreasing revolution speed, on account of the
acaompanying dec~ease in load (in about the third power), as
shown approximately by Fig. 2 (according to bench tests).

The favorable result can

hence be attributed only to the charaoteristics of the particular airplane and must be due to the fact that its head'. resistance diminishes with its speed.

If the head resistance remained

constant, the en gine effict eno.y would diminish only in proportion to the speed., vlhile the propelle r thr ust and the energy
consumed per kilometer w.ould remain the same, a o likewise the

II. Carburetor Adjustment for Most Economical Fuel Consumption.
Most of the present

air~lane

engines are adjusted more

with referenoe to their greatest possible output, than for economy in

~uel

consumption.

This was demonstrated by the experi-

ments (Fig. 5) in which only the size of the fuel

noz~les

was

changed, wbile the engine speed (r.p.m.) and throttle remained
the same and the air intake nearly so.

the size of the nozz;les.

The highest engine efficiency is ob-

tained in the vicinity of nozz·le

a,

with a certain minimum in-

take of fuel, and the engine was adjusted on this basis at the
factory.

A larger int'ake than this does not further increase

the eff ic.iency > since the intake of air is insufficient fo r the
combustion of a larger amount of fuel.

Conse~uently

the excess

of fuel is wasted, as shown by the rapidly rising specific consumption

The object may be attained, by successively

Furthermore, according to comparative tests, most carbu-

retors are capable of improvement with respect to the thorough
mi~ing

of air and fuel, which is essential for minimum fuel

consumption.
III. Over-compression.
Most present-day engines, at least nearly all of those built
since 1917, employ more or· less over-compression, for lessening
the falling off of engine power with increasing altitude.

Only

because in this connection, on account of the small heat evolution, the temperature of the walls of the combustion chamber

(as \i\ell asthat of the surrounding air) is lower, can the compression ratio be increased, Vlithout danger of pre-ignition.,

The

higher crompression ratio causes a diminution of fuel consumption and an increase of the average pressure, though the latter
can be fully utilized only above a certain altitude.

On the

ground and at the low altitudes for air traffic, such an engine
must be so strongly throttled, that the hea'bing of the walla from
the high compression remains. corresponct.j.ngly low,
With moderate over-compression ( c ~ 5.8), it is usually
sufficient to throttle down to the same sea-level horsepower ob'~ained

under normal compression

~

with throttle wide open.

stronger over-compression requires further throttling to a smaller sea-level horsepower.

This is a disadvantage for air traffic

at low altitudea, because the unit weight is thereby increased,
even when the engine is over-dimensioned to correspond. to the
smaller maxdmum pre ssure rea.u1 t ing from the smaller middle pre ssure.

In contrast with the increased horsepower and in spite of

the throttling, there is still the advantage of smaller specific
fuel consumption, even at sea-level.

According to Fig. 4, there

is a fuel saving of 6% with an over-compression of
as compared with the normal compression of (

E:

= 5.8,

Consequently,

even for air traffic engines, the retention of original application (through taller ~ylinders) of over-compression comes under consideration, but only to a certain limit not muoh higher
than the above-ment ioned value, which can not here be more definitely determined.

Not all engines can stand over-compression,

In types w
:ith insufficient coo::i.-

lng of the hottest parts of the walls of the oombustion space,
spark plugs,

e~aust

valves and cylinder bottoms, the permissi-

ble normal aompresmon for complete charging at sea-level can
only be small and, for this very reasoD. it is, with this type' of
engines, often raised to the limit where spontaneous
occurs,

~ombustion

In such a case, even a slight over-aompre s sl on is only

made pOssible by such strong throttling, that its practical applioati on is out of the que st ion.
The

ben~ol

fuels, which are of preponderant importance for

air traffia, are less sensitive in this way, sino'e they ean
stand a higher compressi on than gasoline, on account of their
higher kindling temperature and slowel1 <.rombustion rate:.
ACQording to war experience, no disadvantage arose from moderate over-compression and there islikewise none to be feared
in air traffio.

For avoiding exoessive stresses, care must be

taken to render even the temporary delivery of "altitude ga s "
above sea-level horsepower impossible.
Engines with strong over-compression are somewhat sensitive
only to a sudden stopp ing when heated from running under full

W
ith the last revolutions there then occur, in spite of

the switching off of the electric ignition, violent self-ignitions
which Cause back strokes of the engine with strong stresses.
This is however prevented when the stop is made gradually, as it
should be for any aviation engine, after it haSrun empty for
several minutes and become partially cooled.
