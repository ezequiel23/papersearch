$1. This report -was prepared by Dr. H. Bateruan for publication by the National Advisory
CommiLtee for Aeronautics.
The tlkwry of small oscillations about a state of steady motion
-which was de-doped
many years ago by E. J. Routh * has been appIied with marked success
in ~eroclynarnics, the desired simplicity of the equations being secured by the introduction of
the resistance coefficients by G. H. Bryccn=3 Ilk simplification of the equations is based on
the assumption that in a s~mht departure from a state of steady motion the increments in the
component aerodynamicaI forces and couples can be expressed in terms of the increments of
the component velocities of translation arid rotation rdo~e yithout any additional terms clepencIassumption seems to give a
ing, for instance, on the increments of the accelerations.
gwocl approximation
to the truth in the ease of an airplane, but in the case of a balloon the
additional terms are required.
When a flying machine is treated as a rigid bod~ the general
type of steady motion is one in whleh the center of gra-i-ity describes a hebx and the algebraic
equation which determines the tempornl characteristics
of the oscillations is of the eighth
h the case of an airplane hav@
degree, but this equation can be simplified in certain cases.
m plane of symmetry, the oscilIaticms about a state of steady rectilinear flight can be regarded
as built up from longitudinal and lateraI oscillations which are practically indepe~dent of one
tino ther. When certain resistance coefficients are assumed to be zero each set of oscillations is
associated -with an algebraic equation of the fourth degree.2
.4 notabIe simplification also occurs in the case of a body Ike a pmwhute which has an a.us
of symmetry, when the steady motion is rectikear
and in the direction of the axis of sp-rnetr~-.
In a recent report on the dynamical anal@s, 3 Messrs. Klemin, Warner and Denkinger
ha-w studied the effect on the period and rate of subsidence of the pitching oscillations of an airplane of a change in one of the resistance deri-ratires when @ the others are kept constant.
Xt
occurred to the author that it might be -worth -w-Me to continue this work by considering simultaneous -radiations in-t-w-oor three of the deri-ratiws and to pay special attention to cases in which
a slight change in some of the deri-ratives has (1) no effect, and (2) a marked effect in the characteristics of the lo~~ oscillation.
The results which haw been obtained are e.xhibitecl by means of diagrams in which two of
the resist ante coefficients are used as coordinates, and cur-res are drawn aIong which the modulus
of deca~ of a long oscillation has a constant due,
numbers being given to inclicate the ~alue
of the period at various points of each cur-i-e. .%t Mr. Warner’s suggestion numbers ha~e beeu
given in some cases to indicate the ratio of. the period to the time of damping to half the initiaI
amplitude, as this quantity is adopted as a measure of stcbility in the report to which we have
just referred.

On this account alone we can

fully.

If some of the other resistance coefficients aIter at the same time as q the unfavorable
effect of a decrease in the value of ~ ma-y be partially or completely offset.
Thus if, when we

improve the stability as far as the long oscillation is concerned.
With smaLl values of ~ a considerable incre~~e in g may be needecI to keep t constant w-hen q is decreased> but a much smalIer
increase in y may be sufficient to offset the unfa-rorable effect of the decrease of q. The effect

It appears that an increase in $ from 2 to 3 has practicality no effect cm Lhe position of the
curves t= constant, but it does lower the period; hence an increase in 1 scans to lx unfavomble.
A comparison of diagrams IV and V indicates that an increase of z from 0.1 to 0.2 10WCR
the curves t = constant and is on the whole favorable to stabiliiy.
The general conclusion then is that, if some kind of a flap held by a spring is to be used
to improve the stability, as far as the long oscillation is conccrncd, it shoul{l Ijc chosen so m
to decrease Z,,, increase – X., and make M,, positive.
The diagrams may also be used for other purposes; in particular, tJley mtiy be used 10

the origin along a ~urve t = constant, the period p increases, and so the s~abiIity is impraved.e
It may then be advantageous to decrease both P.U$Oand – .Ug, but – Jlq must not be dccrcascrl
too rapidly.
There is a Iirnit to the ratio of – dg to – d.r if we wish the change to bc favorable
to stability, and this limiting Take may be shown clearly on the diagram by drawing the curves

A comparison of diagrams I and II indicates that an increase of w from 2.9 to 3.9 increases
the period y and has more effect on the time of damping t when ~ is negative tl~an ~vhen ~ is
positive.
When ~ =2, the time t apparent] y increases with w; but, wlwn q =1, t increases for
small values of t, e. g.} those less than 13.8, and decreases for large ‘values of t. When q =0 nnd
~ = – 1, t decreases as w increases, the effect being quite marked when ~ = – 1.
In diagram VI the effect is shown of making 8 difterent from zero,
It appeurs that by
making 3 positive we decrease the time of damping and produce verl lit~le chat}ge in tl~c
period.
Other things being equal, an increase in 6 seems to be favorable to stability.
It should
be noticed, however, tha,t Xq occurs in the expression for Y, consequently unIess an increase
in X* is balanced I)y a decrease in Zq the numerical ~-alue of T’ will be lo]vered znd tho values

It appears then that the Meet of zn incrc.am in
.Xq may be offsefi by the change in T’. It should be observed, however, that, ;shen A-Q is
about 3, the percentage change in the value of V is not large, and so the effect of the increase
in 3 shouId predominate over the effect of the change in ~’. In diagram VI u is wriMcm in

With the aid of these equations the curves t= ccmstant may be drawn in the (r, y) plane
for various sets of values of z, f, ~, ,and w. It will be seen from the diagrams that there is a
mwked difference between the cur~es for which g is positive and those for which ~ is zero or
negative.
It. has been pointed OULrecently by Prof. E. B, Wilson 8 that in normal flight at a ftiirly
low angle of incidence the quantity NP is negative, and that cousecluently there is no need
for a fine adjustment of the values of AT., L,,, NP, and Lp in order to secure both spiral stability
and stabiIity in the Dutch roll. .4t larger angles of iucidence AL may be zero and even positive,
and then there is moro need for a fine adjustment.
On this account most of the diagrams have
bem drawn for zero and positive values of t, one diagram being deemed sufilcient. to indicate

It should be noticed that in the diagrams the region of stability is bounded by the curve
t = m and the line y=?.

The shape of the curves t= constant, is very much the same for the diflereut

If we wish an airplane to have rq+stanee derivatives for which the period is not semitive,
a good plan is to bring the representative point as close as possible to the straight line aIong

A study of diagrams W-II-XII
reveals the following properties:
(I} The greater the vaIue of .$the greater seems to be the effect on the damping of a change
in w.
t2 ) Au increase in w decreases the time of damping but does not. great~y alter the period.
(3) An increase in q decreases the time of damping aud increases the period when t= o;
but, when $=1, 2, or 3, the effect seems to be re-rerse.
(4) An increase in z seems to widen the gaps between the curves t = constant and to greatly
increase the period when g = 1 and f =2.
It. will be noticed that in diagram XIII the numbers on the curves t= constant indicate the
value of $.
