The following translation was made by the Paris Office of the
NatioDal Advisory Commi ttea for Aeronautics in view of the general interest that bas been ev:1.denced in connection wi th nunerou.s engine tests
con~u~ted, for. the National Advisory Committee for Aeror~utics in the
Al t5. tude Chamber of the Bureau of Standards. tbe resul ts of which have
appeared in tbe Co~itteels reports.
With a view to in~estigating the power decrease of a 260 H.P.
Daimler engine at alt~twies, 8nC_ the behavior of tbat engine when
fresh air :'s inductpd, tests were made at the high a1 ti t,xle test bench
(vacuum chamber) at Fr.ied:d.cbshafen from November, 1917. to Febru..".I'Y.
1918. Th~ last few tests were specially intended to decide what increase of power may be gai~ed and what conditions of work are realized
\vhen fresh air is suppl.ied to the engine through a blower. The present author first, made the proposal in January, 1917. that normal aircraft should be equipped with a centrifugal blower for that purpose
and that it should either be directly coupled or - espec~ally in the
case of giant airplanes with several engines - be worked by the main
shaft or by a special engine.
The vacuum chamber, which enabled the above-mentioned tests to be
made on the ground under conditions considerably like those at a certain al ti tvde, was lent for the PT!1.'pOSe by the Zeppelin Ai::-craft Works
at Friedricbshafen. The inbuildiug of the engine and the entire preparations and measuring gear were taken care of by the Experim~~tal Department of the Zeppelin Wo~ks, under the direction of E~ginee~ Leitmann, whose invaluable support and collaboration are hereby g~ateiully
aCknowledged. The engine was furnished by the Rea Equipment Depot

at Doberitz. The idea of supp17ing fresh air by external pressure, or by
means of a blower, originated with the present writer, as also the alterations entailed, i~ conseq~nce, in the engine and in the fuel s~p17.
The centrifugal blower was one of those intended to be mounted, by way of
ex~eriment, in the 1000 H.P. giant aircraft.
It was constructed by Brown,
Boveri & Co., in close collaboration with the writer.

!-HE VACUUM CHAMBER.

The vacu~ chamber of tha ~ppelin Dirigible Worksat Friedrichshafen
is constructed for the purpose of experimenting on engines and radio
equipmen.t with regard to their suitability for high altitudes, and also
for investigating the adaptAbility of the crew in that respect.

•

It consists of a ferro-concrete building with a groUDd. area of 8.5
by 4 sq.m., 3.4 m. at its highest pitch. A vacuum is created in the chamber by an ENCKE'S positive blower driven by electriC power. The pressures
are obtained by means of two autanatic regulating vaJ.ves which are subsequently replaced by an ordinary stop-valve. The exhaust gases are taken
off through a capacious passage, where they are cooled by running water
and exhausted by the positive blower. The test chamber ccmnnmicates wi th
the exhaust passage by small, adjustable orifices, so that there is equal
pressure in both. The engine-power is measured by a water-brake, the fuel
consumption by a calibrated measuring reCipient. Waen the power is furnished by outside air and blowers, the fuel is weighed. The number of r~v­
olutions is recorded by an ordinary aircraft tachometer, and its work is
repeatedly checked by a hand-tachometer. The temperature of the cooling
water is re~ated by the addition of fresh water. The exhaust pipes, and
afterwards the under-side of the crankcase were cooled by means of water
sluicing to enable duration tests to be made. The cooling water for engine and brake is likewise removed by means of a positive blower driven by
ele ctrici ty.
The chamber is provided with double doors and a. sluice, thus supplying
a means of exit when vacuum prevails in it. A dial telegraph serves as a
means of communication from the inside of the chamber to the outside. As
the centrifugal blower must be installed outside the vacuum chamber, orders
are passed on by flash signals.
When a 260 H.P. engine is working and taking in its fresh air from the
chamber, about 340 mID. mercury absolute, corresponding to an altitude of
about 6500 m., may be maintained. If the whole of the fresh air for the
engine be perm
itted to flow in from the outside, about 450 mID. mercuryab.solute only (about 4500 m.) can be attained. When tests were made in extremely rarefied air, the workers wore oxygen maSks, and a large flask of
oxygen is always kept in the chamber, near the fire grenades, for use in
case of emergency.
It may here be mentioned that the chamber, in its present condition,
is the result of long and costly experiments. Cdnsidering that it would
scarcely be worth while £or the majority of aviation engine manufacturers
to construct altitude benches of their own, though future needs will make

it urgently advisable to investigate engines with regard to altitude rethe Zeppelin Dirigible Works have offered their vacuun chamb,e r
and its measusing installation, for rent for such purposes.

THE ENGINE AT

DECREAS~NG

ATMOSPHRlUC PRESSURE.

The D, IVa engine, No.29609, was mounted on the test-bench for investigation, without any alterations. For the first series of experiments,
fresh air was taken in from the expeTimenta.l chamber a.l'ld indmted thrr)ugh
the air-passage of the crankcase ig the usual manne::-. ~'he engine ran wi th
light gascline, \j =: 0.708 kg/ dc at 15°C. The time of cons'lIDption for
every 3 dec. 3 was registered by a s~op-watch, the pre3s~~e 1n the chamber
by two dirigible barOOleters. Whenever a vax-iation in p.cessure was cansed
by the open ~vg or closing of the re~11~ting press-~'o valves in the chamber, norma.l l'egime condi tiens were set up e:o.d. each reading waS repeated
sevez-al times. The powers v.ere f),xed. for 1450 and 1550 r.p.~ alternatively.
The results of these tests are collectively given in Table 1. The
same values, j.n terms of al tit\l.d.e, ar e shown in Fig. 1 (meastU'ed on the
d~.rj, gi bl e barometer) t and in F;.g. 2 in terms of atmospheric pressure
(Cu,;:,ve 1).

There is a striking decrease of power at high altitudes. The tests
were conAeq...uently made Ur...d.er altered CODditioll~. The fresh air was again
taken from the E;x.peX':i.mGnta:'. chamber, but it was no lo:oger i.!ld.uc ted to the
crankcase by the passage, being directly i~ected into the carburetor.
Table 2, and the plotting of curve 2, Figs. 1 and 2, show that the powers
resulting on this occa~ion were considerably higher and the consumption
lowe~, and the explanation of this must be sought for in the different temperatures of the inducted air. The temperature of the air directly in
front of the carburetor was not, unfortunately, measured at the first test,
but we may safely assume that the air is heated to some extent by passing
the hot crankcase; the more the atnospheTic pressure deoreases, and the
mass of air in consequence, the moro heated does the air become. As the
crankcase was cooled by the intake air alone, during the first tests, it
became hotter and hotter in proportion to the duration of the test and
the decrease of atmospheric pressure, and this again increased the heating
of the air still more. There was also a difference in the temnerature of
the air of the chamber from which the engine inducted air for the two
tests: it amounted to 16° to 20 0 at the first test and 120 to 14 0 at the
second.
If it were necessary to draw a conclusion from these testa as regards
conditions d~ing flight, the effect of temperature on the power or charging coeffiCient would have to be known, as also the chem~.cal and thermal
efficiency of the engines. up to the present time, it was general11 considered that the power might be set dovnl in terms propo~tj~na1 to the temperature of the outer air.
This supposi tion is suffici ently accurate so
long as the differences in questi~are slieht, but if the air becomes
strongly heated on the way to the intake valve, it is only the temperature
in front of the intake valve that can be taken as a standard. The dependency of the power on the temperature of the outer air, as resulting from a

\
- 4 -

number of later tests with the D Iva engine, is shown in Fig. 3, which
th~s gives an apprc x~at e idea of t he 9uw8r cu~ ~es at diffe~ent t6WperatureG wi th increasing atmo"l-phel'in pres sure.
The outside temperatures ar.e h~re marked beside the test points,
and the Dunber of the tel';t i.s also sta.ted , i n b~ackets. Although the
values for highe~ and lower tewpera~~~e8 a=e distinctly different, these
tests by no means suffice fer the establisbment of a perfectly fau.ltless
standard, owing to the fact that othe:c ~31:"iable fa~to::-s ent9l' into ae...:
count in the above-named c 0mbi.natio:'l of t est va,lu.e s. and that tbeir influence on the engine power bas not yo '.; been expJa:'.ned and cannot, in consequence, be suppressed. Tbese fact-<;>rs are, abO'~e all, the increase of
temperature of the air, whic·b varies w'i. th the density of the air and the
temperature of the cooling water anct. affects the ef'ficiency of the carburetor; and also the effect of diife~ences between the intake and exhaust back-pressure.

•

Fig. 3 gives positive proof, bowever, of the fact that the engine
still functions perfectly wlth an air temperature of 0 0 'in front of the
carburetor, and that it attains j ts highest power with very slightly increased fuel consumption. (see Teble 3). Considering that the air is
cooled from 20 0 to 25 0 - according to the richness of gasoline in the mixture - through the evaporation of the gasoline, it must be assuned that
the carburetor heating, the w-axmth of the bvxnt gases remaining in the
cylinder, the compression and the hot walls of the cylinder and valve
suffice to evaporate the fuel. We must here observe that the intake pipes
were thickly covered with ice during the tests, although the temperature
of the surro,mding air was +10 0 or more. In the a:~rplanef the air was
always inducted through the engine casing and was thus wanned again. By
this means, the air should seldom reach the carburetl)r colder than in the
tests in question, even in the case of the lowest temperatUl'es, while the
formation of the mixture and the burning should be faultless with sufficient carburetor heating.
Although there may be little difference hetween the conditions for
actual airplanes and for tests, it appears to be desirable that a mean
power curve should be plotted for various flying altitudes, in proportion
to the absolute temperatu~e, Curve 3, Fig. 1. It was assumed, in this
Case, that the air in the crankcase passage had been heated to 20°. The
mean annual temperatures given by the Wagner Meteorological Tables for
corresponding altitudes were taken as the temperatures of the air.
In establishing engine power for a given altit~e, consideration must
be given to the fact that such engine power is practically dependent on
the atmospheriQpressure, which may, however, vary greatly at a given alti tude in the course of a year. More accurate values may therefore be
deduced from the power curve if the powers be expressed in terms of atmospheric pressure, and the temperature and atmosph9rlc pressure, at the
al ti tudes in question, be calculated at a given time. Fig. 2 shows the
powers in terms of pressure, and Fig. 4 repr esents tests 1 and 2 with the
Daimler engine, the number of the tests being also set down. The upper
curves are those of the same powers calculated at 760 IDm. barometric pres-

If the eogine power were merely proportional to the pressure, that
is, to the pressure and. absolute temperature of the outside air, the
above curves would result in hor~zontals. The rapid decline of the curves
as compared to the straight lines, provides a. standard for the "altitude
characteristics" of the engine. In the tests in question, this rapid
decHne is due to the heatj.r:Ig of the intake air. Tbe hotter the cra..'lkCase becomes, and the lower the pressure, the greater is the influence
on the efficiency of the engine.
The inadequate working of the carburetor is another factor, though
influencing it in a secondary degree. It has been previously stated·
that the supply of fuel in the carburetor diminishes less, wi th increased
altitude. than the weight of air taken in with every stroke of the propeller. The result is an over-rich mixture, in which a large proportion of the fuel leaves the cylinder in an unused state and is consumed
outside as exhaust flame. The thermal efficiency of the circulation is
thereby considerably lowered, as may be seen from tbe increased speoific
fuel consumption represented in Tables 1 and 2. Improvement in this respect migbt be obtained by the use of a carburetor that could be regulated by means of an automatic or band-worked nozzle-spray, according to .
the weigbt of inlet air.

Decrease of engine power is further influenced by mechanical efficiency. When tbe number of revolutions remains constant, the light running
wo:rk of the engine scarcely diminishes at all, except for its being lessened by the decrease of working pressure. altbough its proportion to tbe
brake power increases with altitude.
The future alone can show to what extent the altitude power of tbe
normal Da~ler engine may be improved by other carburetors, or bow closely
such decrease woulu app~oach a proportional decrease of pressure.
By way of cmmpari son, the power curves of the Ma1ba.ch Mb IVa and Mb
H S Lu engines with 1450 r.p.m. a~e plotted in terms of altitude in Fig.5,
on the basis of measurements previously taken at the Zeppelin Works. In
Fig~ 2, the values are also inscribed in Curves 3 and 4.
In Fig. 5,
Cu~ves 1 to 3 relate to the Mb IVa engine. as follows:
Curves 1 with light
gasoline power ( ':J = 0.708), Curves 2 working with heavy gasoline ('! =0.750)
and Curves 3 to benzol power t in whicb case tbe carburetor might remain constantly open. Curves 4 refer to the Mb H S Lu e!lgine with. ligbt gasoline
power. In Fig. 2, Curve 3 relates to the Mb IVa eDgina, and Curve 4 to tbe
Mb H S Lu engina.

THE ENGINE WITH DECBEAS!NG OUTSIDE TEMPER.ATURE AND CONSTANT
PRESSURE IN FRONT Ob' THE CARBURETOR.

These tests constitute a series preparatory to the working o~ the
engine with compressors. Fresh air. was inducted to the carburet.or by outside piping instead of be5.ng admitted through a blower. The air :;l)ressure
was therefore constant, while the press~e in the experimental chamber
and the exhaust ba. ~ preSSllI'e ware cape.ble of being regulated. The fuel
tank and the float chamber were connected with the air passage of the carburetor by a pipe about 6 rom. in d:i£lm eter. A receptacle couta:l.ning about
1/2 1i tel' was attached to the overf1.fJ~'V pipe ()f the float, and fi tted wi th
a pet cock thro'l1gh which the oveI':flcw gasoline was drawn off. A cowl
that can be sere',ved and unscrewed was fitted on the outlet of the £loat
needle, and the valve spindle of the mixing tb~ottJ.e was rrade taut by
means of a leather washe:J:. The air is admitted d..Lr.ectly unc1.er the carburetor in order to avoid i 'l;s ueing ileated 'by the crankcase. The air passage is not tav~, however, as it comrn~~icates with the inte~ior of the
crankcase through the oil vapor exbaus~ ports. Air cooling being impossi ble on account of limi. ted space, water was sp:-ayed into the air passage
to cool the c~ankcase.
These preparations were so adjusted practically that the engine worked
satisfactorily from the cO::rJl1lsncement of the tests onwal'ds. When there
was depression in the chambe..l' 1 fresh aiz- could be let in, and the pressure gradually raised in fZ'ont of the c:.al'.... buret ol", by means of a valve
located in the air passage leading to the carburetor. T:'le enILine showed
no disturbance with abrupt increase of p~essuxe, nor with gradual increase,
such change being marked only by a.."l increase i:1 the number of revo:_utions;
that is, by increased power.. ~ne mean pressure in front of the carburetor
was about 720 rom. (Friec'richshafen is si t1lated at an al tHude of about
400 m., mean barometr.ic pr.ess1.1re 730 mID.) :'200 HP was the maximum brake
power attained at an altitude of 4000 m. (see Table 3). The main object
of this test was that of investigating the behavior of the engine and
of the fuel supply with super-pressure.

IV.

ENG1.NE WITH BLOWER.

A turbo-compressor was attached to the outlet airpipe. A detailed description of this compressor will be given later on. It was driven by a
D II-engine, 120 HP, and it compressed 5200 kg. per hour with a total compression ratio of 1.75, corresponding to the quantity of air requir.ed
by fOt~ 260 HP engines with a maximum of 1600 r.p.m., and by the turboengine. The compr.ession ratio o£ 1.75 should be effec~ed as soon as the
airplane has reached an al tj, tuae of 4500 to 4800 m. and when the compr e ss0
ion in front of the cal'buretoo:' amounts to 1 constant absolute temperature.
Only one engine being attached at the tests, and the blower being located
outside the vacuum chamber, the compression ratio waS obtained by throttles
in the intake pipes.
In these tests, too, the working was faultless from the beginning so
far as the combined working of engine a.nd blower were concerned. The results of the tests (see Tables 4 and 5) and any sta.tement of conclusions
were put off for the time being, until a clear understanding could be ar-

rived at on certain points.

The

power of an engine may be influenced in

90

many different ways that it is ext=emely difficlllt to distinguish single

influences. In addition to the effect of the mixing temperature, heat of
the cooling water, etc., the effect of the difference between the intake
and exhaust ba.ck pressure must also be taken into account. During the
compression of the blower, the engine functions in this case as a compressed air engi~a, and the compression wo~k of the blower is regained, the
exhaust back pressure diminishing wi th a1 ti tude, so that the useful diagram surface is notably enlarged. At the same time, the exhaust back
pressure is proportionally lessene~. The cy~inder efficiency is improved,
and a sort of sc:a.venging is vbtained when the openings of the exhaust
and. inlet valves coincide.
All these conditions must necessarily bring about the increase of
engine power with altitude.
An investigation was maO.e of the manner in which the Daimler ,·ellgine
works when charged with fresh air, of its overload capacity, and also
of the possibility of find.ing some snbsti tute for the adjustable bladed
propeller in the constant power engine.

,
.

.,

The writer has proposed that propellers specially constructed for
mean altitudes and for the atmo6phe~ic conditions and flying speeds
therein prevailing should be used instead of adjustable bladed propellers.
Larger pitch, and also, when it is possj.ble, larger' diameter, is thus
obtained for the propellers than in the case of ordinary propellers with
similar power. It is a known fact, however, that the power absorbed by
the propeller varies with the thtrd power of the nunber of revolutions. while
the power of the engine varies, in the proximity of the maximu:n. with the
first power of the number of revolutions.
In order to obtain constant power from a propeller in the region of 0
to 5000 m. altitude, the number of revolutions of the engine must therefore be altered from about 10% below the average to 10% above it. To obtain total power from the e~ ina with this diminished number of revolutions, the blower must suppl;r higher pressure, and a greater mixed charge
must be injected through the blower.
Fig . 6 shows the course of curves of power. torque and consumption of
the Daimler 260 HP engine for three different admission temperatures, pressures b, and exhaust back-pressures Pa in front of the carburetor.
The values of Curves I are as follows: b = 830 rom. mercury, Pa = 736 rom .
mercury, t r-' 40 0 Cj Curves 2: b = 760 !DID. mercury, Pa = 736 IDID. mercury,
t ~ 30 0 ; and Curves 3: b = 720 zrm. mercury. p = 728 IDID. mercury, t ~ So.
This shows that low compression suffices to prodftce considerable increase
of power, so that increased torque can be realized without difficulty.
with the reduced number of revolutions. There we~e no Cases of breakdown,
even with frequently repeated overloading, nor were there any sparking
plug breakages observed. as in the case of super-compressed engines. The
work of the engine was somewhat hard with powers of 300 to 320 HP, but
there was no disturbance even with a duration test of half an hour.
Its capacity for overloading is of special advantage at starting in

- 8 -

the case of heavily loaded aircraft or when there is a short starting run.
The duration of overloadi~ is a short one in both cases, ~~d no danger
is incurred, in conse~uence, by the engine.
The

~uestion

of temperature is particularly important when working
~th co~resao~~,
The compreSSion and internal losses (friction and
leakages in the blower) al~e mostly converted into heat, so that the air
is conse~uently more or less heated in propo~tion to the compression
ratio. If fresh air is suppl ~ ed thr ough a blower driven separately, the
pressure corresponding to the altitude of the time ba i ng must be produced
by al ter ing by haDd the number of r evol uti ons of the bIow:i.ng engine.
The highest compression ratio is then re~uired at the highest altitude,
and. generally when the temperature of the air is lowest. The temperature
of the ai~ in front of the carburetor thus remains within acceptable
limits. This is not the case for compressors coupled to the main engine
or to the central gear, because the compressor always revolves at the
same multiple of the number of revolutions of the engine. The pressures
produced are therefore too high for the lower flying altittmes, and must
consequently be throttled. As the highest temperatures generally prevail
at these low altitudes, the compressed air reaches the air in a strongly
overheated condition at low altinmes. It may be neCessary, in such
cases, to insert a;_
r-coolel's between the compressor and the engine. The
gain in power resul ting from such cooJing may be considerable, as has been
seen from tests. Less stres~ is also put upon the cylinder, when better
cylinder charging is effecte~ by cooling, than by increase of pressure.
SUMMARY. Reports of tests of a Dai~ler IVa engine at the test-bench at
Friedrichshafen, show that the decreas.e of power of that engine, at high
al ti tudes, was established, and that the manner of its wOl'king when air
is supplied at a certain pr.essure was explained. These test~ were preparatory to the installation of compressors in giant aircraft for the purpose of maintaining constant power at high altitudes.
SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE. While the above report was in the Press, the Zeppelin
made further tests with regard to the dependence of engine power
on the temperature of the air, at different pressures in front of the
c~buretor, and valuable figures were thereby obtained. The results are
collectively stated in Table 6, (tests Nos 150 to 158). In Fig. 7,
those values are given with those of eal'1ier tests. The numbers inscribed
in the figure refer to the number of the test: Curve 1 to 730, Curve 2
to 760, and C\U've 3 to 777 mID. mercury absolute in front of the carburetor.
In all three cases, the e~ust back pressure amounted to 730 mm. ~ mer­
cury. Straight line 4 shows what the curve of power would be if it decreased in proportion to t he increase of tempel'ature.
Wo~ks

Since that time, the first flying tests have also been made with a giant airplane of the Staaken type, with four D IVa engines, equ.ipped wi th a
compressor. The airplane attained almost 6000 m. on that occasion, as compared to its previous maEimum altitude of less than ~OOO m.
