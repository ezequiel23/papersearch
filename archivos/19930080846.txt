THE F AC?ORS THAT :JETEffi.JINE THE MINIlWll SPEED OF AN AIRPLANE.
By

F. E . Norton,
Aer odynamical Labora tory, _J, A, C. A. '

A large range between the maximum and minimum speeds of an
airplane is of undisputed value,

ei~her

to perm:t safe landings

in small fields vlith the mecliul.t1 or slow speed machine, or to
permit landing at a:l

wi~h ve~y

The fac-

understood, but

ratiler strangely the limiting f2,ctOJ.:S of the m:Lnimum speed have
seldom been recognized.

The '/vhole que stion of minimum speed

has usually been settled by the
•

stateme~t

that the wings have

reached the point of maximum lift, whereas there a.re very few
airplanes that can be flown at, or beyond, this point, and a
great many that can not reach withi:l 50 of it.

Because of

this general misunderstanding of the principles of flight at
low speed ~here are a large number of machines that could be
made to fly severc:l miles slower than at present by slight modifications.

In the follo'Ning p2vragraphs, therefore , the factors

that affect the r:linimum speed. 'viII be discussed with the hope

comes beyond the scope of the discussion.

In order to

show how greatly the wing section affects the minimum speed,
curves are plotted in Fig. 8 against various loadings.
If a numbe= of lift curves from model tests are examined
it will be found that the lift fulls off beyond the maximum in
some oases slowly as in curve (1) in Fig. 3, some rapidly as
in curve (8) and some, especially the high lift sections , drop
off suddenly (curve 3).

Now it certainly 1;10u1d be most aWk-

ward when pulling up the nose of an airplane in making a 1anding to have the lift falloff suddenly 85 or 50 per cent, and
for this reason it was formerly thought unwise to use wings
that showed a discont inuous lift curve in the model.

However,

more recent t ests have proved that if these sections are run
at a high enough speed the discontinuity disappears.

Also the

fuselage in comoination with the wings has the property of
flattening the burble point .

•

These facts are shown very strik-

ingly in Fig. 4, where the lift curves are plotted for a model
rang , the same Wing in a model airplane, and the full-sized
airplane. *

The lift values show a close agreement up to 16 0

·.-.-here they begin to diverge, the full-sized ma.chine continuing
straight on, the model wing falling off rapidly, and the model
airplane taking an intermediate path.
The disposition of the wings on the airplane slightly affects the lift coefficient and a few cases will be discussed.
The aspect ratiO has a slight effect on the maximum lift as

It is difficult to obtair: values of th . lift coef-

skill required to fly a

stead:.ly at this angle.

The

burble point, however, was reached with a JN4h airplane (?ig.4)
in one case.

I t has been the practice to compute the landing

speed of a machine from the maxin:un lifo coefficient obtained.
\.
on the model wing , and by a coincidence this procedure is -very
nearly correct as the full-sized machine lands at an angle of

much lower than the burble point.

As -,vill be shovtJrl lat er this difference is

There is one

In gliding flight this

Every l.:>ilot knows that it is nece ssary to hold the st ick
':v31l back ~7hen flying at the mininn.A"TIn speed ~ and this is especially true in a glide when the elevato~s are not in the slip
stream .

In a great many rr.achine8 the controls are pulled bac k

to their greatest extent when flying slowly , and in such cases
the longitudinal control is tte

This is sho'vVn clearly by a fe \7 con-

trol !)osition curves from free flight tests plotted in Fig. 11.*
It is also ev ideEt that as far as the longitudinal control is
concerned a lo wer air speed

':'he reason for "Ghis -J}!'eak in t11e contl'ol posi tion curves
is due mainly to the -:a.ct that the center of pressure travel on

The lateral control

is seldom associated with tl:!e a.bility to fly at very low speeds;
but nearly every pilot will say that the reason he can not fly
more slowly is that the machine stalls, and a stall is falling
into a aide slip or spin because of
ailerons and rudder .

the actioL of the ailerons is seen to be very slug-

The

ineffectiveness of the ailero.ls is shown very strikingly by a

The other mem'.Jer of the latera:;" con-(;rol, the rudder, is

As an instance of this a pilot was able to fly a

trials.; anothe r pilot on t he same m
achine and ', vith the same
we ight, after considerable practice was able to reach a steady
speed of 40 m.p.h. because of his greater skill in using the
rudder to prevent the machine from falling into a spin.
W
hen designing a machine the preceding conditions for low
speed should be considered, as they do not in general conflict
with the other desirable properties.

In particular, care should

be taken to provide a powerful lateral control as most pilots
quite properly refuse to make full use of the lo w speed properties of their machine be cause of the chance of pulling into a
spin or sideslip.

A great many crashes or landings can be traced

to a lack of lateral control.

Excessively large ailerons c an

not be used on a high speed machine because they are too stiff,
that is, it is necessary to slow do'an before it is possible to
go into a turn wit:i.1 any considerable bank, but it would seem
possible to increase their efficiency without mak i ng them larger.
In conclusion, the following list of factors affecting the
