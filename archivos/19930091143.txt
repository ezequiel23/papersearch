PREFACE.

With each delivery of a new type or size of airplane the manufacturer furnishes (1) the
data and (2) the computations by which to judge the performance and safety of the machine.
Under “data” may be classed the geometrical dimensions of the entire craft and its
parts; the physical properties of its materials, both raw and as treated for final use, and a
description of the method of treatment of these materials; the measured strengths of the
whole structure and of its elements; the weight schedule, giving the maas and position of the
structural parts and of the carried loads; the aerodynamic properties of the sustaining and
control surfaces, the body, the undercarriage, and the craft as a whole; the records of inspection and full-scale test, etc. To this must be added much special information about the
engine, the propeller, the navigating instruments, etc.
Under “computations’1 may be furnished information as to the stresses and performance
of (1) the motor; (2) the screw; (3) the craft aa a whole.
The present work, intended as a handbook, covers primarily the theory of airplane stress
analysis, but ignores, as foreign to its scope) .the forces within the engine and propeller. It
presents analytical methods and formulas with little if any argument, assuming the reader
can supply the proofs or will not require them. All the formulas are illustrated byproblems.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.
By A. F. ZAHM.
INTRODUCTION.

This report was prepared at the Aerodynamical Laboratory, Navy Yard, Washington,

D. C.,by direction of Rear Admiral D. W.Taylor, Chief Constructor, U. S. Navy, and Member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, for publication i the committee’s
n
Fifth Annual Report.
1 TERMINOLOGY.
.

The mechanical terms in this text bear the same meaning as in standard works on applied
mechanics; the aeronautical terms, where practicable, follow the nomenclature published in
1917 by the United States National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (Report No. 25).
Some words not so published are used of necessity, and when of uncertain meaning are defined
upon their first appearance in the text. For example, “air force” for the resultant of air pressure and friction. As an abbreviation for “angle of incidence,” the term “incidence” is sometimes used in this text, as is commonly done in aerodynamic works.
2. UNITS AND DIMENSIONS.

.

For the most part in this text ordinary British units are employed. The unit of mass is
sometimes the pound; sometimes the slug, or g pounds, g being the acceleration of gravity.
The standard of air density is taken 89 0.07635 pound, or 0.00238 slug,’per cubic foot, or
that of dry air a t 760 m. m. and 15.6’ C. Hence the familiar full impulse pVz, per unit cross
section of a jet, is 0.00238 Vz pound per square foot when V i s feet per second, or 0.0051 Vz when
Vis miles an hour. And the air force on a normal surface of A square feet is R = 0.00238 CA Vz
pounds a t Vfeet per second, C being a dimensionless multiplier, called the ‘(shape coefficient,”
or “absolute coefficient”-a constant independent of the system of units.‘
3. NORMAL AND ABNORMAL LOADS.

,

Structurally an airplane is under normal load in two notable cases: (1) On earth when
resting naturally on a level surface; (2) in air when in steady straightaway fight at any incidence? I n these cases the external applied forces, whether due ’to air, earth, or motor, are
constant and in algebraic sum equal to the weight of the craft. Some may be positive, others
negative.
I n all other conditions the loading is abnormal and may be either constant or not; either
uniformly increased or not; either positive or negative. For example, an airplane in steady
fight around a level circular course bears a constant load determined by the speed and curvature.
For this case the actual load in terms of the normal is tabulated in figure 5. For the large
path curves there shown the increase of loading is substantially uniform throughout the
structure. Again the craft may be diving steeply a t steady speed and incidence. Then its
loading, both lift and drift, is constant; the first smaller than normal, the second larger. When
the machine is standing on earth some of the loads are reversed from their direction in air;
when flying inverted all “lift ” loads are reversed.

In general, the same formula applies toaninelinedflatsurface whose lam ana is A , so long as its ipcidence andorientation remain constant.

4. SUDDEN LOADS.

Inconstant abnormal loads may arise from sudden changes of air speed or incidence, as
in diving, or riding gusts; from motor jerking; from impact against earth or water, etc.; and
their change may be uniform throughout the structure or localized; uniform or irregular in
growth and decay. But frequently it suffices to assume that all parts of the structure sustain
the same acceleration and hence the same change of load. If this acceleration be j a t any part
of the airplane, the masses in that part induce stresses j/g times those due to their weight alone,
assuming j and g in the same direction.
When practicable in engineering tests, an accelerometer should be carried in the active
machine to record the component accelerations in the air and on the earth. To find j throughout the craft, it is well to use several accelerometers distributed throughout the structure.
Sometimes the acceleration is estimated from observed or assumed data. For example,
suppose that a craft, regarded as a single rigid mass in pure translation, lands with vertical
velocity component v , whose “head” is h==v2/2g1
and comes to rest with u n i f i cushioning, of
yield d.1 Then the ratio of its average vertical acceleration to gravity is’
j/g = 1 + h/d.
(1)
It is twice this amount if, as rarely happens, the cushion resistance be directly proportional
to the cushion deflection d.
Equation (1) is true not only of the machine as a whole, but of every part of it, however
elastic the structure. I the craft approach land in pure translation, h is the same for all
f
elements, but d varies throughout the structure, being least in the chassis parts and greatest
in the parts remote from the impact points. A like treatment applies to longitudinal and
lateral accelerations.
The assumed maximum acceleration to be provided for in the design of an airplane is
usually specified by the purchaser.
Example 1 .‘-If an accelerometer fixed to.an airplane records a maximum vertical acceleration of 48 feet per second, what is the ratio of the abnormal to the normal loading?
Example 2.-An airplane in landing has a vertical velocity component of 10 feet per
second and a uniform cushion yield of 6 inches. Find the ratio of the abnormal to the normal.
stresses in the landing gear, assuming the machine to be a rigid structure.
5. SIMPLE STRESSES.

The direct simpb stresses here treated are the common tensile, compressive, and shearing
For each the intensity or unit stress is uniform over the cross section and is given by
S =PIA,

stresses.

P being the load sustained by the structural cross section A. For each case the load and strese
have the same direction. For torsion in a round shaft the intensity of direct shearing stress
a t different points of a cross section varies directly with the radius to those points and in the
outermost fiber is
S = M-c/ J
(3)
where Y is the torsional moment, c the distance from the center of gravity to the outermost
fiber, J the polar moment of inertia of the section.
6. INDIRECI’ SIMPLE STRESSES.

Indirect simple stresses perpendicular to the applied loads occur in transverse and in
tonional loading. I n both cases the longitudinal and the transverse shearing stresses a t
any point are equal.
I The cushion form may be partly air Ilft, partly spring Uft. The air lift dimIdahe8 slightly with u the spring lift increases with d, t h w h

FOR

AERONAUTICS.

I n transverse loading the tension or compression is greatest in the outermost fibers of
the beam and is
s = Mcl I,
(41
where M i s the bending moment, I the moment of inertia of the cross section.
I n a beam so loaded the longitudinal shearing stress varies over any cross section, being
zero a t the remotest fiber and increasing toward the neutral axis of that section. At any
reference axis Y in the section, parallel to the neutral axis, the horizontal shear is

8 - a c V/It

(5)

where a is the sectional area outward from Y.c the distance of the centroid of a from the
neutral surface, V the total shear over the entire beam section, and t the thickness of the
beam a t Y. I n most, but not all, practical cases the horizontal shear is a maximum a t the
neutral surface. Its value there is, for a round beam, 413 the mean vertical shear VIA; for a
rectangular one 3 VI2 A.
Example 3.-Find the longitudinal shearing stress in a 4-inch square beam given the total
vertical shear as 1,400 pounds; first with the diagonal vertical, then with it inclined 4 5 O .
7. RESULTANT UNIT STRESS.

When several causes simultaneously produce like stresses a t any point in a structure,
these may be algebraically added.
(a) Endwhe stresses due to trimultaneolls e n d h e and transverse loads.4everal endwise
stresses may occur a t a point simultaneously. Thus in the lower rear spar of an airplane
the lift produces tension, the drag compression; the bending moment produces tension and
f
compression. The algebraic sum of all these is the effective stress. I P be the aggregate
endwise stress, the above operation is expressed by the following equation,

S-P/A* M/Z,

(6).

in which M is the bending moment due to the running load only, z, the section modulus.

The
obvious physical meaning of this equation is that the first term represents the unit direct stress,
em
the second t r the unit bending stress, which may be taken either as tensile or compressive.
A more accurate formula for the total endwise unit stress here considered is

8 -PIA

+ MI2 i-k’Pd/Z,

(7)

in which d is the deflection due to 211 only (computed as in figs. 13, 14, 15, 16), and k is a
correction factor to be applied to d, because the latter is slightly increased by P.
If in (6)and (7)PIA is a tensile stress, the succeeding terms can be reduced to “equivalent tensile stress” by multiplying them by s b l s , , or the ratio of the bending to the tensile
strength of the material. This is sometimes done when s b differs materially from St. Similarly, when PIA is a compressive stress. The equation (6) then assumes the form

S =S t iT MIZ
(8
where S is the equivalent tensile stress and r is the ratio of the tensile to the bending strength
of the material. The equivalent compressive stress is similarly found.
Formulas (61, (71, may be used for wing spars and for non-tapering flat struts bearing a
considerable side wind pressure. But if the strut be tapering, S can not be found by formula
(7) here presented, since d i unknown. However, for normal flying conditions the deflection
s
i s ignored, since there is no appreciable side wind against the strut.
Example 4.-Find the resultant unit stress in a 2-inch square simple beam, due to an
endwise load of 900 pounds, a maximum bending moment of 1,100 inch-pounds, and a maximum deflection of 0.05 inch a t the place of maximum moment.

in which P is the actual end load producing stresses lower than the elastic limit, 1 is the length

depending on thc material, strut form, and manner of constraining the ends.' Values of a

( c ) Combined shearing and normal stress.-If a t any point of a section, S is the normal unit
stress, and S. the transverse or the equal longitudinal shearing unit stress, then a t that point the
maximum resultant shearing stress S,, and maximum normal stress S, are, respectively

(12)
Example 5.-A beam is subject to a compressive unit stress of 200 pounds per square inch
and ab the same time to a longitudinal shearing stress of 250 pounds per square inch. Compute the maximum resultant stresses.
8. REPETlTIYE AND EQUIVALENT STRESS.
When a variable load stresses a member frequently through a fraction m of its elastic
limit, the equivalent steady stress may be taken as
S'-S(l + m P
(13)
where S is the allowable constant stress, and n is unity for very numerous stress fluctuations,
zero for very few.l
Example 7.--If a member whose allowable constant stress is 20,000 is stressed frequently
to 15,000 and has an elastic limit of 60,000, what is the equivalent stress?
9. MAXIMUM STEADY LOAD AND STRESS.
For a member subject to uniforin simple stress the greatest possible load it will sustain is
. P-SA
(14)
S being the strength of the material, and A the sectional area of the member. Examples in
airplane construction are: For tension, the stays; for compression, the short struts; for shear;
the clevis pins. In all such cases the maximum load and maximum unit stress occur together.
For a structural element not subject to uniform simple stress the greatest possible load may
exceed that causing the greatest stress. A long strut, for example, may bear a greater endwise
load and sustain less fiber stress before much bending occurs than when bowed excessively.
For a Din-ended wooden strut having a slenderness ratio llr, above 120, the maximum load
is compute; by Euler's formula
P = 9EI/F

is used, where A is the middle section area, C the crushing strength of the material, k the least
radius of gyration of the middle section. If the strut has very securely fixed ends, the above
two values of P, may be quadrupled.
The crippling load on any strut or column is sometimes given as a function of the slenderness
ratio IIr, in tables or diagrams derived from laboratory tests of full scale test pieces.
Exumple 8.-Fmd the maximum load for a pin-ended spruce column of length 60 inches,
cross section 3 square inches, and moment of inertia 0.3 inch '.
10. FACTORS OF SAFETY.

Given the resultant fiber stress intensity, this may be divided into an assumed limiting stress
The limiting stress is
determined from standard test pieces of the material and of the st&ctural forms in question.
For each material and form employed in the industrial arts the assumed limiting st$ressis commonly fixed by agreement between the constructor and the purchaser. For s t a p , turnbuckles,
fastenings, etc., and sometimes for struts-also for entire truss members, wings, fuselages, etc.the factor of safety is taken as the ratio of the greatest possible load to the greatest actual load
of the member, the former load being found experimentally, the latter either by calculation or
by instrumental test under working conditions either real or simulated.
Ezample .9.-Find the factors of safety in example 6 for a maximum shearing stress of
1,000 pounds per square inch, and a maximum compressive stress of 4,000 pounds per square
nch; also the factor of safety in example 8 for an applied load of 250 pounds.
to find the strength-stress ratio, commonly called the "factor of safety."

11. SCOPE OF TREATMENT.

The study of wing stresses may cover in succession the fabric, the ribs, the ailerons, the
spars as beam members, the l i t and drag trussing. From the resultant stresses so found
are computed the factors of safety for steady normal flight, taking account of the known
strength of the individual members or of their dimensions and materials.
12. WING FABRIC LOADING AND STRESS.

The tensile stress in the fabric a t any point of a wing surface may be computed from the
given curvature and air-pressure distribution at that point. Typical external pressure distributions on a monoplane surface are shown in figures 1, 2, 3, and 4. The internal pressure
is sensibly constant and unknown, but with impervious fabric may be made equal to the
external surface pressure a t any point by perforating the canvas there.
At any part of the surface, as in figure 6, let p be the resultant point pressure of the air
in pounds per square foot, a the distance in inches between ribs, and e the depth in inches of
the bulge in the canvas midway between the ribs; then the fabric tension t , in pounds per
linear inch, neglecting the effect of the fore and aft curvature, can be shown to be approximately
2 = 0.00087 p2//c.
Values of t for various air pressures and bulging of the fabric are given in figure 6.

(17)

13. RIB LOADING AND STRESS.

The usual airplane rib may be considered as a beam supported at two points (at the spars)
and sustaining the air force on all the fabric lying nearer to itself than to the neighboring ribs.
In figure 7 is shown the distribution of the air force normal to the rib surface and also the
distribution of the components of this air force normal to the chord. The running load on the rib
is not sufficiently uniform to make applicable the ordinary formulas for uniformly loaded beams.
.
By considering the average loading upon each element of length as a concentrated load
we may compute the shear and moment for a number of points and plot them as in figure 8.
T i process, however, is laborious.
hs
For approximate treatment we may divide the rib into three parts, the segment between ,
t h i spars, the front segment, and the rear segment, and consider the total running load on
each segment as a concentrated load. The magnitude and position of each such load may be
found by well-known methods. From these concentrated loads the shear and moment diagrams can be readily drawn, as shown in full line in figure 9, where the dotted lines are superposed from figure 8. The maximum vertical shearing forces are practically the same in both
cases, while the maximum negative bending moment in the case of such approximation is about
twice that of the true moment and should be halved for the working approximation.
If the concentrated load on the front and rear segments, as shown in figure 9, be denoted for
each by R and located a t a distance 1 from the spar, the unit bending stress next to the spar is

S =Rl/Z,
(18)
Z being the section modulus of the cross section of the unsevered part of the rib segment
where it meets the spar.

A N N U A L REPORT N A T I O N A L ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Again, if R, the concentrated load on the portion of the rib amid spars, is distant a and b
from the front and rear spars, respectively, the unit bending stress at R is
S=Rabl(a+b)Z,
(19)
2 being the section nodulus there. Dividing S in (19) by 2 gives a fair approximation to the
true bending stress for the distributed load.
The rib shearing stress may be found by the shearing stress formulas presented in Part I.
Example 1.-A rib loaded as in figure 39 has the dimensions there specified; find the
unit stresses for bending, maximum shearing, and average vertical shearing just outside the
spars and just inside the spars; also the unit bending stress at B between the spars.
14. AILERON LOADING AND

STRESSES.

The loads on the aileron are the control-wire pull and the air force. The normal pull may
be taken as the greatest the pilot would care to exert regularly in flight and is measured with
a spring balanoe when the pilot seated in a stationary machine vigorously plies the control.
The aileron moment equals the control-wire pull times its distance from the aileron hinge
axis; also equals the aileron air force times its distance from the hinge. I this latter disf
tance be assumed of some reasonable magnitude and be divided into said moment, it gives
the amount of the air force. Sometimes also the air force is estimated from the size, incidence,
and forward speed of the aileron, taken with suitable aerodynamic data and with allowance
for the propeller slip stream, if any. I n practice, the aileron force may be assumed to be a t
the center of the surface and equal to PA, where P is the resultant pressure per unit area of
the aileron surface A. The value of P is usually specified by the purchaser.
Having thus found either the control-wire pull or the moment of the air force on the
aileron, the stresses may be readily computed from the frame diagram by the usual methods
of statics. I the moment of the air force tends to twist the aileron’s hinge rod, the unit
f
stress in the latter is computed by the formula
S= M/Z
(20)
where M and Z are, respectively, the given moment and the torsion section modulus. I n this
case the aileron ribs are simple cantilevers jutting out from the hinge rod, and are stressed like
the trailing edge of a wing plane, and are treated by the foregoing rib analysis.
Sometimes the control wire pulls on an aileron lever from whose outer end several stays
m n to the rear edge of the aileron’ surface, as shown in figure 38. Each principal aileron rib
then sustains a compressive component force due to the applied stay, a transverse running air
force, m d the transverse component forces of its outer and its inner end attachments. If only
the transverse forces be considered, the aileron rib stress may be calculated by the formula for
the mid segment of a wing rib, as already treated. The endwise force causes, a t any cross section of t,he aileron rib, a compressive unit stress roughly equal to that force divided by the
section area.
.
The leading and trailing edges of the aileron are treated as continuous beams supported and
loaded as in figure 13.
Example %-An aileron benring a uniform pressure of 20 pounds per square foot has the
dimensions and structural form shown in figure 38. Find the moment about the hinge and the
stress in the control wire. Find also the vertical reactions a t the stay wire upon the trailing
edge beam.
15. RUNMNG LOAD ON WING PLANES AND SPARS.

The air loading and weight of R wing plane is in general not uniform along the whole length
of the plane, but may be taken as uniform for each small unit of the length. The actual distribution of the air lotiding throughout the length, in a uniform wind12 illustrated in figure 4. For
is
1 In this text the term “wing” denotes a main supportingmember on the right or left o! the airplane. Thus, a biplane wing comprises two wing
planes, the i‘top plane” and the “bottom plane,” joined by “interplane” trussing. Similarly for a triplane, a quadruplene,a multiplane.
* Inca%a propeller slip stream washes tho plane the wind is still less uniform over the plane. To be very accurate, this m e would require
special treatment.

practical computation this distribution may be taken as constant along each panel or each spar
length of the wing plane, and is so taken in the present treatment.
The manner of referring the running air load and running weight of the plane to the spars,
and there resolving them in the plane of the lift trussing and drag trussing, is shown in figure 10.
Let L? D, Wbe the running lift, drag, and weight of the plano and all bl the distonces, respectively, of their points of application from the rear spar, a and b being numerical fractions and I the
distance between spars. Then a t the front spar the parallel components of L, D are aL, uD;
and the parallel co‘mponent of W is h W,which, taken from aL, gives the net running lift across
wind a t the spar in question. Compounding graphically this net lift, uL-b W, with the drag aD,
gives the resultant spar running load R. This resultant is now resolved graphically into the
components
w,in the lift and drag truss planes: also into w,w1in the spar web plane and
normal thereto.
I n a similar manner the resultant running loads and their component running loads in the
lift and drag truss planes may be found for the remaining spars. Frequently in practice the
running load on the lower spar of a biplane is found from that of the upper by dividing by some
simple ratio, say 1.2, as indicated by aerodynamic experiments.
Example 3.-A biplane wing has the form and loadings shown in figure 41 ;find tho resultant
loadings on the spars and their components in the planes of the lift and drag trussing for angles
of incidence of 2’ and 12’.

.

From the running load w,on a spar, figure 10, and from the position of the strut pins, or
constraints, tho bending moments, shearing forces, pin reactions, and deflections may be computed by the familiar formulas for loaded beams. I n general, these four quantitaties can be
computed by direct use of Clapeyron’s original three-moment theorem, figure 11, but for usual
cases are more conveniently found by the formulas derived Cherefrom and presented in figures
13, 14, 15, 16.
(a) Rending mments and bendir:g stresses.-The bending moment diagram is usually a chain
of parabolic curves, whose maxima are tabiilated, for usual cases, in figures 13, 14, 15, 16. From
these maxima and the tabulated joint moments the complete diagram is plotted, as in figure 17.
I n some unusual cases tho ayes of the spar, strut, and stay do not pass through a common
point. The increment of moment caused by such eccontricity of the stay attachment is treated
analytically in figure 12 and applied graphically in figure 18.

plane of the spar web, figure 10, from which may be computed the unit bending stresses in
the spar. The unit stress is given by the equation
S = MIZ,

(21)

Mbeing the moment and Z the section modulus of the cross section of the spar.
( b ) Shearing forces and shearing stresses.-The shear diagram is drawn by plotting as
ordinates the values of the transverse shearing force on each side of the pins, then joining thu
ordinates by straight lines, as shown in figure 17. Each line, as is well known, cuts the spar
axis a t a point of zero shear and of maximum moment.
The values oi these shearing forces multiplied by w/w,
give the shearing forces in the
plane of the spar web, from which may be derived the corresponding shearing stresses by the
shear formulas of Part I.
(c) P i n reactions.-From the two “vertical” shears a t any spar joint the pin reaction
is most readily found by simple subtraction as in figures 14, 15, 16. If the points of zero
shear-that is, of maximum moment-are known, the pin reaction a t any joint is taken m the
distance between the neighboring maxima times the mean loading.
(d) Deflection.-To find the exact place and amount of the maximum spar panel bending,
the deflection curve may be plotted from the elastic equation given in figures 14, 15, 16.

a spar or wing plane is its portion between consecutive lift struts.

Otherwise, since the point of maximum deflection in any span is near that of maximum bending moment, the latter point may be taken as the place of maximum deflection. Then the
approximate maximum deflection d is, by the formula of figures 14, 15, 16,
d( = y ) = - ~0[122cI(I- XJ + 4 V(P ~ 0 ’ )+w(P -xO3)]/24 EI,

17. CONCENTRATED LIFT AND DRAG ON WING TRUSSING.

The total lift component on any strut pin in the plane of the lift struts i s equal and opposite
to the pin reactions given by the formulas of figures 14, 15, 16 for a running load in the plane
of the lift trussing. Multiplying this lift component by w2/w,) figure 10, and adding half the air
resistance of the adjoining strut and stay wires, gives the drag component on the strut pin in
the plane of the drag struts. The pin lifts and drags so found are taken as the applied loads
on the lift trussing and drag trussing and are used to find the endwise stresses in their struts,
stays, and spars. Convenient formulas for the concentrated drag loads are given in figure 20.
An alternative method for finding the force on the strut pin is to multiply the mean
running load on the spar by the distance between the points of zero shear in the adjoining spar
panels. Equivalent formulas for this operation are given in figure 21.
I n applying this alternative method, if the points of zero shear have not previously been
found they may be taken as a t the centers of each panel except the inner or root panel. For
the root or inner panel the point of zero shear is three-eighths the panel length from the body
hinge of the “engine section.” This i an approximate method sometimes used for brevity. Its
s
accuracy may be judged by reference to the typical moment diagram of figure 19.
To the above concentrated lifts must be geometrically added the weights of the struts and
stays and in some cases the weight of the motor, the force of the aileron, the thrust of the
propeller, etc.
W h e n external stays are applied to the wing, such as lead wires or under struts, these may
either be assumed severed or be taken as an integral part of the trussing. They are commonly
assumed to be severed, so that the wing may be shown adequately strong without them and
not liable to disaster in case of their accidental rupture. Then in turn the external stays are
assumed to bear the whole lift or drag while the internal ones are severed.
If any sloping external stay, figure 24, of length r, whose three projections on the reference
planes of the machine are x, y, z, sustain a tension R, whose components are X, Y, then
2,
R/T= X / X Y / y = Z/Z.
=
(23)
Thus if any internal drag wire should fail, causing a forward pull X in the lead wire, the
stress in this latter would be R = r X / x , entailing a compression in the spar Y ==yX/x.
I n case of cabane stays, figure 24, the y may be zero and R=rX/x. Similarly, the stress
in a for,-ad-aft diagonal wing stay, supporting a drag X on the top plane, is R=rX/x.

18. ENDWISE STRESSES IN MEMBERS OF NONMULTIPLANE WING TRUSSING.

(a) Due to lift and drag.-From the given concentrated loads and frame diagram of the
wing, the aggregate endwise stresses, and thence the unit stresses, are found by well known
analytic and graphic methods.
n
Convenient analytical methods of fhding the aggregate stresses, i. e., i struts, stays, and
spars, are presented in figures 22 and 23. The usual graphic method is illustrated in figures
26 and 27.
I the stress in but a single strut or stay of a biplane be desired, i t can be obtained directly
f
by an appropriate formula as a simple summation, or a product following a summation. I n
such truss analysis the following generalizations may be useful:
1. Any strut exerts a thrust equal to the sum of all the loads preceding it. Thus in figure
22 R is preceded by the loads G , G’, H,H‘,Z, and therefore exerts at Z a thrust equal to their
sum.
2. Any stay exerts a tension equal to the sum of the loads preceding it times its own
length divided by the truss gap.’ Thus for the stay Q the tension is (H+H’+Z+Z’) qlh.
Otherwise the vertical component of any stay tension equals the difference between the strut
thrust and the concentrated load on the Strut joint; also the horizontal tension component
equals the difference of the spar thrusts on either side of the joint.
3. -Any top spar panel exerts a thrust equal to the sum of the moments of the preceding
loads about its inner end divided by the gap. Any lower spar panel.exerts a tension equal
to the sum of the moments of the preceding loads about its outer end divided by the gap.
The tension in a lower spar panel equals the compression in the one obliquely above and out
from it.
(a) Endwke stresses in struts, s.%ys, and spars due to Wing torsion.-The aileron lift P A
exerts a torsional moment M- PA1 about the wing axis distant 1 from PA. The ensuing
endwise stresses in the wing struts, stays, and spars can be calculated by the formulas for a
twisted pyramidal truss given i figures 33 and 34.

IS. ENDWISE STRESSES IN MEMBERS OF MULTIPLANE WING TRUSSING.

Figure 25 gives a general process for finding the stresses in a multiplane wing truss, and
applies it to a triplane. Before employing this method the total lift on the StNt exerted
by all the planes is found by summing their individual lifts, as in article 17 on concentrated
loads.
20. STRESSES IN REDUNDANT TRUSS MEMBERS.

-

The last article illustrates the case of a truss having redundant members, whose stresses
are indeterminate by rigid statics, but determinate by elastic statics. To generalize this case,
suppose a multiplane wing truss having initial stresses in both its load wires and its landing
1 “Trus

gap” here means the dlstance between spar centers i either the Ut or the drag Plane,

wires. Here a lift L applied to a strut causes increase of tension in the load wires, decrease
in the others. The increments of tension in both load and landing wires can be resolved vertically, summed and equated to the increment in L which causes them. The obvious expression
for this is, by figure 25,
AL = APm/p AP'm'/p' AQnlp AQ1n'/p'
' in which the primes refer to the landing wires which cross the load wires diagonally. In many
practical instances of wing and body construction the unprimed and primed quantitiei are
respectively equal. The formula then becomes:
*AL 2 (APm/p+ AQnlp)
=
s
Example 15.-Given the data for figure 25, a below, solve for the tensions in the stay
wires; L = 145 pounds; m = 60 inches; n = 50 inches; p = 99.8 inches; p = 94.2 inches; A =
.012 square inch; B = .012 square inch; and E = 30,000,000.

PART III.

AIRPLANE BODY STRESSES.
By A. F.XAHM.
21. SCOPE OF TREATMENT.

The study of airplane body stresses may cover in succession: The tail unit; the tail skid;
the chassis or landing carriage; the fuselage; each case compromising the applied loads, the
induced reactions, the strength of the structural elements, and finally the factors of safety; the
fuselage being treated last because stressed by ad the other members thereto attached.
22. THE TAIL UNIT.

The tail unit comprises (a) the vertical tail surfaces; (a) the horizontal tail surfaces. The
combined air forces on the tail surfaces-that is, the lateral force on the vertical surfaces and the
vertical force on the horizontal surfaces-are taken as applied loads on the fuselaga stern when
in flight.
(a) The vertical tail surfaces.-The rudder may be hinged to the rear edge of a fixed vertical
fin attached to the stern of the fuselage or other rearward projecting framework. The loads on
the rudder are the air force and the tiller pull. In unbalanced rudders the normal tiller pull is
usually taken as the greatest force a pilot would care to exert in regular flying, and is determined
by measuring with a spring balance the force exerted by a pilot when seated in the stationary
machine and plying the control vigorously. I n common practice the force is assumed, as for the
aileron in section 14, to be a t tha center of the surface and equal to PA, where P is the pressure
per unit area of the rudder surface A. '
The fixed vertical fin sustains both its own air force and the hinge forces exerted by the
vertical rudder. The first may be taken as P A applied at the center of the f area; the second
h
may be computed by use of figure 13.
( 6 ) The horizontal tail su$aces.-The
horizontal'rudder, or elevator, is usually hinged to the
rear edge of a fixed tail plane, or stabilizer. The elevator stresses are found as for the cases
already considered of the aileron and the vertical rudder. The stabilizer is treated very like
a monoplane wing except that it sustains considerable force on its rear edge, due to the hinge
pressures, and is aerodynamically in0uenced by the presence of the horizontal rudder, and commonly also by the propeller slip stream.
Exaqple 1.--An elevator bearing a uniform pressure of 20 pounds per square foot has the
dimensions and structural form shown in figure 37. Find the moment about the' hinge and the
stresses in the stays and the control wires; also the hinge reactions.
Ezample 2.-Find the vertical components of the pin reactions of the front and rear beams
of the stabilizer or horizontal fin, figure 37, due to a uniformly distributed pressure of 20 pounds
per square foot and the hinge reactions of example 1.
Emrnpb $.-A rudder and vertical stabilizer bearing a uniform pressure of 20 pounds per
square foot has the dimensions and structural form shown in figure 37; find the transverse loads
on the upper and lower trussing of the fuselage and the transmitted couple about the normal
axis of the various sections.
The tail skicZ.-When the craft is landing or resting on the earth the tail skid force is taken
as a stern load on the fuselage.
The normal static or dead load on the tail skid is its ground pressure when resting on a level
surface, or, in the case of certain waterplanes, it is the static lift on the rear float. The normal
lift of the tail skid is L- TVall, figure 29, if W be the total weight of the craft, and a, 1, the distances respectively of Wand L from the tread, or forward support of the machine.

The live load on the tail skid may be resolved into rectangular components which are found
as in figure 31, when the craft's dimensions and accelerations, there assumed, are known.
Otherwise the maximum tail skid force to be provided against may be specified by the purchaser.
From the force so found or specified the stresses in the tail skid, tail float or superstructure may
be approximately calculated by elementary statics, ignoring the accelerations within the
structure.
Example ,&-Compute the normal lift on the tail skid from the data given in figure 29.
Example 5.-Given
I=60,544 pound-feet2, j x = 16 feet/sec.2, j,= 8 feet/sec.2, a = O . l rad.
/sec.2, in figure 31 and the dimensions of a machine, find the resultant live load on the tail skid.
23. UNDERCARRIAGE. LOADS AND STRESSES.

The normal static or dead bad a t the bottom of the undercarriage equals in magnitude the
total weight there supported when the craft is resting level. The supporting pressures are perfectly definite in some cases, as when the craft rests on two wheels and a skid, or on four cushioned wheels, etc.
The stresses in the under carriage may be-computed first for the normal static load, then
for a similar magnified load by multiplying by an assumed ratio, such as j l q in section 4.
When the airplane pitches, skids, or slews about, other considerations, which may be of
great importance, enter the stress analysis. The case of an airplane skidding or abruptly
canting is treated a t the end of this article.
For a common airplane, figure 29, if I, a be, respectively, the distances aft the axle of the
tail-skid toe and the weight TI' of the whole craft less wheels, then the upward pressure on
the skid toe is Wall, and this taken from the weight gives twice the pressure R on each of the axles.
Resolving R parallel to the side-view projections of the struts, figure 29, gives, respectively, the force P sustained jointly by the front strut and stay and Q borne by the rear ones.
These forces in turn resolved as shown give the stresses in the ihdividual uprights of the undercarriage. The first resolution obviously gives
P*R sin alsin y
Q =R sin @/siny,
(24)
wher0.q 8, Y are, respectively, the angles opposite P,Q, R in the force triangle. Similar equations in turn give the components of P,Q in the uprights,
The stresses in the undertrussing of a typical seaplane a t rest are treated in figure 30.
The lift R resolved parallel to the front view projections of the struts and stays, as shown,
give its components P, Q in the planes, respectively, of the stays and of the struts. Now
resolving P in the true plane of the stays, Q in that of the struts, as shown, gives the stresses in
the uprights.
As shown in figure 29, the strut pairs bear down each with the force R on the a l e , here
assumed to be a straight and single tube. This axle normally finds support a t the centers of
the wheels and sustains on its segment outward from the struts bending and shearing stresses
computable by the simplest cantilever formulas as used for- wing ribs. Between the strut
bearings the axle sustains a constant bending moment equal to the maximum in the cantilever
portion. On this latter portion the maximum vertical shearing stress equals the wheel lift
R; the maximum moment is Rl if 1 be the distance from the lift R to the down pressure of the
strut pair. From the shear and moment the factors of safety are found as usual.
The live load on the bottom of the undercarriage is treated in quite the same manner as
that on the tail skid by the equations of figure 31.
When an airplane skids on the ground or rests with one wheel l o f , the ground reaction
on one wheel can be resolved into two rectangular components, one p a r d e l the other perpendicular to the axis. The parallel component F , say, exerts on the axle a bending moment,
M = FR,where R is the radius of the wheel. If W be the weight, a the angle of cant, F= 1/2
W sin a. The ensuing moment, V = 1 / 2 JFRsin a, map be quite formidable.
Emmple 6.-From the data of figure 29 compute the normal load a t the wheels of the
undercarriage; also the stresses in the undercarriage struts and stays and their factors of safety.

.

Ezample ?‘.-Find the stresses in the undercarriage trussing of the seaplane in figure 30
due to a lift of 600 pounds applied a t a point one-third the distance from the front to the rear
strut attachments.
Example 8.-An airplane weighing 3,000 pounds, with wheels 2 feet in diameter and 6 feet
apart, rests with one wheel 10 inches lower than the other. Find the added bending moment
on the axle, assuming each wheel to bear half the entire weight.
24. FUSELAGE LOADS AND STRESSES.

“he fuselage may sustain gravitational, aerodynamic, and impact or acceleration loads.
The ensuing stresses a t each point of the structure are separately computed, then combined to determine the resultant stress there. A twofold analysis is usually made, (a)for flying conditions,
(b) for landing or static conditions. In both cases the analysis may be made either for the
fuselage as a unit or separately for the rear segment, the front segment, and the center segment.
(a) Fweluge loah and stresses f o r f E y i q conditions.-If the loads exert no torque on the
fuselage, then for a typical rear segment, figure 32 presents the analytical treatment, figure
42 the graphical. I n practical computation the weights of the struts, stays, and longeron panels
are regarded as a l concentrated on the upper pins, rather than as part on the upper, part on the
l
lower pins. The air force on the side of the segment is comparatively negligible; that on the
stern, due to the tail unit, is given in paragraph 2 of this part.
“he gravitational stresses in the front segment are found similarly to those treated in ( a ) ;
the power stresses, due to propeller thrust and torque, engine vibration, etc., may be estimated separately, then combined with the former. The aerodynamic forces on the bow are
usually negligible.
The stresses in the center segment of the fuselage, due to the gravitational and aerodynamic
loadings, may be found separately, then combined with those due to the action of the attached
members; i. e., wings, undercarriage, and front and rear fuselage segments.
When the applied loads exert a torque on the fuselage, endwise stresses ensuing from the
latter are computed by the formulas of figures 33 and 34 for twisted trusses. For example,
if the rudder force P,4 is distant 1 from any axis of the fuselage, i t may be replaced by a force
P A and a couple PAZ, both applied at said axis, the‘ force generating one set of stresses, the
couple another, and each set separately computable by one or the other of the above formulas.
(6) Fwelage loah and stresses for landing or stutic conditions.-For static conditions the
loads inside the fuselage are the same as those for flight. The external applied loads are the
wing weigh&, the reactions of the tail skid and undercarriage. The stresses are found as
shown in figures 32 and 42.
For kinetic conditions the applied loads on each part are computed as explained in figure
31. The stresses are then found as explained in the preceding paragraph.
Example 9/Find the stresses in the struts, stays, and longerons of the rear segment of
the fuselage due to a uniform pressure of 20.pounds per square foot upon the horizontal tailpieces; also those due to gravitational loads alone.
Example 10.-Find the stresses in the struts, stays, and longerons of the vertical trussing
of the front segment of the fuselage shown in figure 35, due to gravitational loads.
Example 11.-From the data in the problems above find the stresses and factors of safety
for the principal members of the fuselage for a steady, circular flight around a level curve of
200 feet radius a t 80 miles per hour.
Example 12.-Find the stresses in the rear segment of the fuselage due to the torsional
loads in example 3.

Figures 35 and 36 show synoptically for a typical airplane body the graphical analysis
and the numerical results for both flying and static conditions. Such detail calculations as

AIRPLANE STRESS ANALYSIS.

Example 3.-A biplane wing has the form and loadings shown in figure 41 ; find the resultant
loadings on the spars and their components in the planes of the lift and drag trussings for angles
of incidence of 2 O and 12O.
The running lift L, the running drag D, and the distances to their points of application (aZ)
depend upon the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing, the angle of incidence, the stagger, the
biplane effect, etc. The running lift L and weight Was determined for any given wing plane
of a machine are constant for all angles of incidence in straightaway flight. In the present
example, however, L, D, W, a, and b are given.

PROBLEMS IN PART III.
Airplane Body Stresses.

Emmple 1.-An elevator bearing a uniform pressure of 20 pounds per square foot has the
dimensions and structural form shown in figure 37. Find the moment about the hinge and
the stresses in stays and the control wires; also the hinge reactions.
(A) MOMENT ABOUT HINGE.

The moment about the hinge is equal to the product of the area, the uniform pressure,
and the distance from the hinge axis to the centroid.
Given A=11 square feet.; P = 2 0 pounds per square foot.
Distance to centroid = 15 in.

Then moment = 1 1 (20)15 =3,300 inch-pounds.
(B) TENSION IN CONTROL WIRE.

The control wire pull times its distance from the hinge axis is equal to the moment in
(a) above.
Tension in control wire =3,300/7.75 =425.8 pounds.
(C) TENSION IN STAY WIRES.

The vertical reactions of the stays are approximately’ equal to one-half the total load
on the elevator. Consider the stays as attached to a flexible rib, forming a continuous beam
on three supports.
Then by table in figure 13, given A X P = 2 2 0 pounds.; b / l = 1.
~1=220/4
=55 pounds.
R,=R,=0.375(55) =20.62 pounds.

The total vertical hinge reactions of the rudders found in example 1 must be added to the
reactions R, and R,. The true pin reactions of the rear beam of the horizontal stabilizer then
become :
R,=67.23 -392.20=359.43
R,= 9.04-0
= 9.04
R, = 67.23 - 293.20 =359.43
Sum

= 727.90

The sum of all the vertical reactions of the stabilizer minus the vertical components of the
stay wire pulls should equal the total load on stabilizer and elevator.

From these reactions may be found the tensions in the stay wires by a treatment similar
to that used to find the tensions in aileron stays. (See example 10, Pt. 11.)
(D) HINGE REACTIONS.

The vertical hinge reactions may be considered as due to a uniformly loaded beam supported a t three points and bearing one-half the total load on the elevator. The reactions are
approximately equal to those found in (c) above. To the middle reaction must be added
the vertical reaction of the mast, which is equalcto the total vertical reactions of the stays, or
one-half the total load on the elevator, plus the vertical component of the control wire pull.
Control wire p l l .

(A) TOrAL LOAD EQUALS THE UNIT PRESSURE TIMES THE AREA.

Given, B=28.70 square feet; P=20 pounds per square foot.
Then, total load=28.70 @TI)=574 pounds.

The ribs may be considered as beams supported a t two pohts (the position of front and rear
beams, see m and n in figure 37). Approximately 0.75 Wand 0.25 W i s carried by the front and
rear beams, respectively.
Front beam, 0.750(574) -430.50 pounds.

1 . SOLUTION.
1
FOR TORQUE OF 7,742 INCHES-POUNDS AT STATION NO. 2.

Given torque=7,742 ins.-lbs.; 1=8.44 ins.; b=15 ins.; a=7.74 ins.
Then by figure 34:
R = torque141
=7,742/4 (8.44) _ _ _ _ ._ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ._ _ _ _ _ _ _ ._
__

229.32 Ibs.
P =R bl2l
=229.32(15)/2(8.44) - - .- - - - - - - - - - - - - - _ _ - _ - - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - - _ _ - - - - - 203.77

__
Substituting these values in formulas of figure 34:

s,S +s,,‘S‘+t,,T+t,’T‘ + 2 P = 0 - 0.1 13s+0.149s‘- 0.470 T - 0.149 T‘ +2(203.77) = O
(I)

(21

V, V+w,’V+S,S +s,’S’+2 Q = O - 0.129 V+0.143 V’- 0.6573 + 0 + 2(105.28) = 0

t,T+t,’T’=O -0.884T+O.Q86T’=0; T’=0.897T
(6)
U , U+U,’ U’ = O -0.804 U+O.981U’ = O ; U’ = 0.819U
(71
u,V+W,’V’=O - 0.880 V + 0.981V’ = 0; V’ =0.897V
(8)
Substituting values of S’, T‘, U‘, V’ from equations 5,6,7,8, in equations 1,2,3,4 we findS = 320.7.
T= 675.0.
U=298.7.

v=678.0.

Again by equations.5, 6, 7, 8
-

S’ = 243.6.
T’ = 605.5.
0’=243.9.
V’ = 608.2.

I n a similar manner the stresses may be determined for stations 8 , 4, etc. The table below
gives these results for the given torsion loads.

GENERAL THEORY.
Let L he the total lift on a multiplane strut, as shown,
P, $, tensions in the stays p, q,
dp, dq, stretches of the lengths p, q, for vertical strain dz of truss,
m, n, strut lengths between joints, '
A, B, E, croas sectional areas of stays and modulus of elasticity.
Then L=Pm/p+Qn/q+etc., for more planes, if any,
P= AEdplp,
Q=BEdqlq,
R=etc., for more planes, if any.
dz=qdq/n=pdp/m=etc., for more planes, if any.
P/Q=Amq2/BnpZ, Q/R=etc., for more planes, if any.

P=LAmq2/(,4m2q2/p+Bn2pa/q).
Q=LBnpz/(Am2q2/p+Bnzp2/q).

FOR A TRIPLANE.

FOR A QUADRUPLANE.
P=LAmrZJ(Am2r2JpfBnzrzp2Jq3f
C oap2/r).
&= LBnpz/(Bn2pZ/q+Co2pzqz/13+
Am2qz/p).
R=LCoq2/( Co2q2/r+Am2q+2/p3+Bn2r2/q).
NOTE.-h
a similar way the equation for any multiplane may he written.
Having thus obtained the strut and stay stresses in a multiplane, the spar stresses follow by ordinary statics.
