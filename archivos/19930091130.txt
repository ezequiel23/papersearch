REPORT No. 68.
THE EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON THE STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.
By the Forest Products Laboratory.

SUMMARY OF GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.

The general conclusions stated below are the outcome of a series of tests which included 26
species, approximately 100 kiln runs, and over 100,000 mechanical tests. The series was undertaken in cooperation with the War and Navy Departments, and in continuance of earlier
investigations on the basis of which the Forest Products Laboratory had drafted, for the War
Department, Signal Corps Specification 20500, General Kiln-drying Process for Airplane Stock. 1
This specification was based on the results of tests of Sitka spruce and white ash material
representing three preliminary kiln runs at the laboratory, and on the general lmowledge of
kiln drying and the properties of wood which the researches of the laboratory in earlier years
had developed. The material for the fu'st tests had been arranged for before the United States
entered the war, as it was antecipated that kiln drying of airplane stock would become
necessary; and the preliminary runs antedated the adoption by the Government of its aircraft
program. Signal Corps Specification 20500 was submitted to the War Department in July, 1917.
While its adoption as an emergency measure was believed entirely justified, additional tests
of its safety for spruce and ash and of it applicability to many other species were considered
essential. It was desirable also to ascertain the possibility of using more rapid processes.
The present monograph presents results of the tests made for these purposes.
The general conclusions reached are:
1. That wood may have its trength pl'opertie , particularly toughness or resistance to
shock, quite seriously damaged without any visible evidence of such damage. Hence, appearance of the material can not, where maximum tl'ength is essential, be accepted as the sole
basis of judgment of the effect of a drying proce on wood.
2. That the effect of a given proce s i not the same on all species of wood.
3. That apparently a given process may be entirely safe for some but quite detrimental
to other material of a species.
4. That proper kiln drying produces material fully equal in all strength properties to that
resulting from air drying under the mo t favorable conditions.
5. That specification 20500-A of the Bureau of Aircraft Production (Table 1 or 2 as specified) can in most cases be expected to produce material fully equal to air-dried.
6. That best results (with respect to strength properties) on Douglas fir will result from
the use of somewhat milder drying conditions than those laid down in Specification 20500-A
(Table 1). Table 2 of this pecification (temperatures 105 0 F. initial to 135 0 F. final and relative
humidities 85 per cent initial to 40 per cent final) is recommended for drying Douglas fir.
7. That in some species there is apparently no relation between drying temperatures
up to 180 0 F. and the strength properties of the dry material. Such a conclusion, however,
needs further confirmation, and temperatures higher than those of Specification 20500-A have
not been recommended.
This work has been done under the necessity of getting results as quickly as possible and
with the primary object of checking the safety of the general kiln-drying specifications when
applied to the drying of airplane lumber on a commercial scale, together with the more or less
incidental object of ascertaining if conditions adapted to more rapid drying could be used.
Under these circumstances it has not been possible to investigate the subject in the fundamental

way which it merits. Completion of the work already begun is contemplated and it is hoped
to be able later to carry out experiments to determine the effect of the various factors involved,
both separately and in combination, and to ascertain the maximum temperature and minimum
humidity that can be safely applied at any stage of the drying process. It is hoped also to carry
on comprehensive investigations of the closely relatcd subject of the bending of wood, for the
purpose of determining the steaming or other processes best adapted to successful bending
and to secure more accurate knowledge of the effect of such processes on the strength of the
wood.
NECESSITY FOR KILN DRYING.

Previous to the entrance of the United tates into the war aircraft engineers had not
encouraged the use of other than air-seasoned wo od, particularly for those parts requiring the
maximum strength. It had not been believed that it was po sible for material to be properly
prepared for such exacting service in any other way than by air seasoning over a period of
several months or even year, depending on the size of t he stock and on the climatic conditions
at the point where the seasoning took place. 'The use of kiln-dried material had been tabooed
because it had not been demonstrated that optimum results with respect to the strength proome of the prejudice against kiln drying was
peI-ties could be secured through kiln drying.
undoubtedly due to acquaintance or experience with material which had been improperly kiln
dried and hence greatly damaged.
Upon the adoption by our Government of an aircraft production program of great magnitude it was easy to be seen that the stock of air-dried material of the species then accepted for
aircraft construction wou ld be exhausted before even a fr action of the production planned for
the first year could be accomplished. Hence, th e kiln drying of material for airplanes became
imperative. 'The prime requisite was to find or develop metho d of kiln drying which would
assure material of maximum strength properties. The problem f cutting the period of drying
to the minimum was not so important, as it was the opinion that a period of from one to two
months for the drying of such species as pruce would answer, if necessary.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS.

â€¢

For some 12 years previous to this time the F rest ervic had been carrying on investigations of the best types of kiln construction and methods of kiln opera tion to produce dry
stock of maximum quality. These investigations had re ulted in the invention, patenting,
and dedication to public use of a new type of dry kiln in whieh excellent control of the important
factors of temperature, humidity, and circulation could e seeured. However, few of the
species of importan ce in airplane construction had b en included in these kiln-drying investigations. Also, the effort had been largely directed toward pr venting the great losse from
checking, casehardening, hollow-horning, and the like, which in many commercial drying
operations had been excessive; and consequently tes ts had not been made to determine
whether material having the maximum strength properties was being secured . However,
about the time the kiln-drying studies were first starLed a very carefully planned and executed
series of tests had been made to determine the effect, on strength, of exposure for various
periods of time to dry air and to steam, both a t various temperatures and pressures. These
experiments 1 were on loblolly pine, white ash, and red oak. Additional knowledge of the
effects of various temperatures had been gain d from the resul ts of te ts of material which
had been subjected to various steps involved in the application of preservative treatment.
Foreseeing the necessity for knowledge of the effect of kiln-drying operations on the strength
of airplane woods, the Forest Products Laboratory before the declaration of war arranged
trength tests made on material
to secure a quantity of partially air-dry spruce and white ash.

oration was also indicated. This denoted that perfection of appearance did not constitute
a safe criterion for the acceptance of material for exacting uses such as aircraft construction,
and emphasized the need for standardization of drying practice and the specifying of limiting
conditions to be used.
ADOPTION OF SPECIFICATIONS AND BEGINNING AND SCOPE OF PRESENT WORK.

With these tests and the previous experience of the laboratory in many lines as a basis,
Signal Corps Specification 20500 (now with some slight modification Bureau of Aircraft Production Specification 20500-A) was drawn up. The general problem of kiln drying airplane
stock, however, was by no means solved. Although the tests which had been made were
sufficiently extensive to form, in the existing emergency, a basis of kiln-drying specifications,
it was very desirable to get a further check upon their applicability through additional tests.
It was also desirable to determine if it would be possible to use conditions adapted to more
rapid drying. Moreover, there were a considerable number of species which were looked
upon as suitable substitutes for spruce, ash, and the other woods which experience had already
shown to be adapted to aircraft construction. It was regarded as essential that safe methods
of drying these species be developed. In addition to this, the laboratory was undertaking
tests of numerous features of airplane construction and it was necessary to have dry material
for use in these tests.
The work has now covered 26 1 species, with approximately 100 kiln runs and with some
100,000 mechanical tests to determine the effect of the processes. It is the purpose of this
monograph to set forth in detail the methods used, to give in considerable fullness the data
secured and conclusions drawn, and thus to make available information for the guidance of
those engaged. in aircraft construction and others who may be interested in kiln drying wood
in such a manner as to retain the maximum strength.
BASIS OF TESTS AND COMPARISONS.

Since kiln drying was to take the place of extended periods of air seasoning, it was but natural to adopt air drying as a basis by which to judge the effect of kiln drying. It might seem to
one not well acquainted with the phenomena revealed by tests of strength properties of wood
that it would be feasible to kiln dry a given lot of material, make tests upon it, and compare
directly with the strength of air-dry material of the same species, as determined by previous
tests. Such a method, it is true, might suffice to detect any severe damage or excessive deficiency in strength properties brought about by the drying processes. In the present experiments, however, the aim was to find kiln processes such that the resulting material would be
at least equal in strength properties to the same material had it been carefully air seasoned.
The decision as to whether this has been accomplished requires more exact comparisons than
can be obtained by the method given above. Also in such work it is desirable to be able to
distinguish small differences in the effect of two or more different treatments in order to discover the tendency of a change in the treatments.
The study of data derived from some 130,000 tests on 129 different species of native woods
tested at the Forest Products Laboratory previous to the beginning of this work has shown
something of the variability that may be expected. It has been found, for instance, that
even when as many as possible of the factors contributing to the variation of timber are under
control, the average of material from a tree selected at random would be expected to differ
from a true average of the species by from 7 to 15 per cent, depending upon which of several
important strength properties was considered. The variation of individual specimens is, of
course, much greater. Consequently, it is essential to make certain that the material subjected to any treatment whose effect is to be found is as inherently like that with which it is
to be compared as possible. In other words, no very close estimate of the effect of kiln drying
upon the strength is possible from comparisons of the properties of two lots of material, one
being kiln dried and the other air dried, and both selected at random.
â€¢ Data and information on but a part of tho species are available and included herein.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY CO M MITTEE F OR AERONAUTICS.

The problem presents two alternatives. One is to divid the green stock of a given tree
or trees into two lots, one of which is tested after kiln drying and the other after air drying.
This involves a delay in the analysis until the air drying i complete and the tests made, and was
deemed impracticable because of the demand for immediate information.
The second alternative is to make a compari on with the results previously obtained from
material of the same species and tested in both the gree n and the air-dry conditions. On the
basis of this comparison a conclusion may be drawn as to whether kiln drying has produced as
favorable a change in properties as had been found, from the previous tests, to result from air
drying. This second method is, of comse, the best adapted to securing quick results. On the
other hand, it does no t, for reasons which have been mentioned and which will be further discussed later, justify as definite and certain conclusions as the first.
The plan actually followed was a combination o[ the two alternatives.
The material for testing was brought to the laboratory in log form, and was there cut up
into three lots. The first was tested gr en, the second after kiln drying, and the third after
thorough air seasoning. Methods of mak ing this divi iOll are f r ther discussed under " Preparation of Material."
As soon as the test on kiln-dried material were available they were analyzed and preliminary
conclusions drawn from a compari on with p reviously air-dried material of the same specie .
This can be safely done only on the part of those who are experienced and familiar with strength
values and particularly familar with the varia tions that are likely to be met with in stock of a
given species grown in different localities. If th e kiln-dried material proves to be greatly superior or greatly inferior it is safe to sa y po itively that it would also have been superior or inferior to stock of the same tree air dried. If, however, the difference turn out to be small and
less than the probable variation of an average of the trength property, definite conclusions are
not possible. This analysis is, therefore, regarded a preliminary and final conclusion are withheld until air-dry material from the same tree and part of t rees ha been tested. The comparisons then possible are known to be free of orne of the fact ors enumerated below and the
rest can be adjusted for or can be redu ced in impor tance by working with a large number of
tests. Where this has been done the difference in strength properties between kiln-dried and
air-dried stock and between stock dried under different kiln conditions can be stated, with considerable assurance, to be due to differences in drying conditions only.
VARIADJ,ES AFFECTING RESULTS.

The factors which affect test results and contribute to their variability may be enumerated
as follows:
(1) Defects (knots, decay, shakes, etc.) .
(2) Density.
(3) Species.
(4) Moisture content and distribution .
(5) Rate of testing.
(6) Temperature at time oftest.
(7) Position in tree.
(8) Tree characteristics (varying with locality of growth, soil, elevation, etc.) .
(9) Unex'plained variations (usually foIl wing the laws of p robability).
These factors must be so handled that their effects will not be mistaken for the effect of the
kiln-drying process. The effects of these Iactors are eliminated from comparisons in the following
manner:
All pieces having visible defects which it is evident would lessen their strength are discarded at the outset. Inspection is also made after test, since some defects are likely not to be
revealed until the specimen has failed .
Regarding density and position in the tree, fairly general relations have been deduced from
the extensive investigations previously m ade. It is a general rule that the strength properties
of wood of any species vary directly as some power of the density ; that the density, and therefore
the strength, decreases with height from ground at growth (spruce seems to be an exception to

this); and that there is a considerable but unpredictable variation between strength and distance
from the pith of the tree. Provided the test specimens come from the same height in the tree
and the same region of annual growth, there does not seem to be much difference in strength
with regard to cardinal direction in the living tree.
It is evident, then, that the influence of density, position in tree, and tree characteristics
can be eliminated from comparisons, as far as the kiln-drying work is concerned, by selecting
material for test in the green, kiln-dried, and air-dried conditions, not only from the same tree
but also from its corresponding parts. The existence of tree characteristics also makes it desirable that several trees be represented in each kiln run. It is also found that unexplained
variations are such as to necessitate that each tree be represented in each group (green, air-dried,
and kiln-dried) by a considerable number of specimens.
The effect of moisture content and distribution could be eliminated by bringing the kiln and
air-dried material to the same moisture content before test. This, however, requires an
excessive amount of time and it is found more feasible to allow for comparatively small
differences in moisture content by making ad justments of the data. These adjustments will be
discussed later.
Differences in moisture content between parts of the same specimen are avoided by allowing
a period of air easoning after the kiln drying, thus bringing the moisture in the material to practically uniform distribution. Material which is air dried is not tested until it has reached a
practically constant weight and the moisture content has become approximately uniform.
The effects of rate of test and temperature at time of test are cared for by properly standardized testing methods.

AN UAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

It may not appear necessary to perform all of these tests on the green, kiln-dried, and airdried material in order to get a sufficiently reliable basis for the determination of the effect of
kiln drying. On the other hand, it would not do to select one kind of test on one property
and assume that if the kiln dried stock proved to be superior or inferior to air-dried, all
the other propertie would also be Sup!3rior or inferior. The several properties may very
well, and do in fact, prove to be affected in different ways by the various conditions of seasoning.
This phenomenon is amply illustrated by data presented later.
PROPERTIES ON WHICH ANALYSIS IS BASED AND THEm SIGNIFICANCE.

The analysis of the effect of kiln-drying is, therefore, based on the tests which bring
out the properties deemed most important in airplane construction; namely, static and impact
bending and compression parallel to grain; although all of the tests are made because the tests
of lesser importance can be made at a comparatively low cost and serve at times as a check on
the conclusion reached from a study of the principal test data.
The properties chosen for principal attention in the analysis are five in number. They
are: Modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, and work to maximum load, obtained from
the static-bending test; height of drop, obtained from the impact-bending test; and maximum
crushing strength, obtained from the compression-parallel-to-grain test.
By modulus of rupture is meant the computed fiber stress in the outermost fibers of the
the beam at the maximum load. It is a measure of the ability of a beam to support a
slowly applied load for a very short time. I t is not a true fiber stress, since the formula
by which it is computed is exactly applicable only within the elastic limit. The term is, however, universally accepted and the values are quite comparable for various species and sizes
of lumber. It is, moreover, a definitely measurable quantity which does not depend to any
extent on any personal factor as does, for instance, fiber stress at elastic limit.
The modulus of elasticity is a measure of the stiffness or rigidity, of a material, and is of
value in computing the deflections of joists, beams, and stringers, and safe loads for columns.
Although it is derived from the static bending test it is directly applicable to columns as well
as beams.
Work to maximum load represents the ability of a wooden part to absorb shock with a
slight permanent or semi-permanent deformation with some injury to the wood, and is a measure
of the combined strength and toughness of a material under bending stresses. It is one of the
most important properties as far as airplane wood is concerned.
Height of drop is the vertical fall of a 50-pound hammer causing complete failure under
the impact-bending test, and represents a quality that is important in members which are
occasionally stressed beyond the elastic limit. It is a very variable quantity but ranks with
work to maximum load in importance as a measure of the suitability of a wood for airplane use.
The value of maximum crushing strength, as obtained from the compres ion-parallel-tograin test, lies in the possibility of estimating the strength of parts used as columns. It is a
very simple test and is frequently the only one used in studying the effect of a treatment or
process on wood. However, it does not necessarily follow that others are affected in the same
way and, particularly not with respect to the very important properties of work to maximum
load and height of drop. These latter are measures of toughness, or shock resistance, which
quality is not brought out by the compression-parallel-to-grain test. 1
The manner of conducting these and the minor tests and the significance of each of the
properties is discussed in various circulars and bulletins of the Forest Service of the United
States Department of Agriculture. 2

PREPARATION OF MATERIAL.
SELECTING, CUTTING, AND MATCHING OF ST OCK.

The necessity for having material so selected that comparisons will be only between groups
which consist of material inherently alike has been pointed out. The method of cutting logs
and selecting material will be illu trated for each of several species. Great care has at all
times been taken to make certain that kiln-dried material is as inherently like the green and
air-dried to which it is compared as possible.
In most cases the material for test was selected in the woods or from log yards and sent
to the laboratory in log form. There it was stored on skids in the yard until required. In general, species which were in use or considered as sub titutes for spruce in wing beams, struts,
etc., were cut into 2; or 3 inch planks, in which sizes the material was kiln-dried. Species
looked upon as promising for propeller woods were sawed into I-inch lumber and kiln-dried
in this thickness.
Test specimens were 2 by 2 inches in cross section for those species dried in the 2t or 3
inch thickness. Bending specimens were 30 inches long and were tested with center load
on a span of 2 inches. Specimens from the species dried in I-inch thickness were i by 2 inches
in section. Bending specimens were 20 inches long and were tested with load I1t the center of
an 18-inch span.
Specimens for test while green were cut and planed to size at the time of cutting material
from the log. Specimens for test after air drying were at the same time cut roughly to size
and stored for drying. Specimens to represent the kiln-dried material were not cut until after
the kiln-drying was completed. Specimens which were to be air-dried were carefully piled
in a shed where they were well up off the ground, were sheltered from the sun and from precipitation, and were subjected to very free circulation of air. Ends of these specimens were
dipped in melted paraffin to retard drying from the end . The endeavor was to give them the
best possible environment for air-dryinO'.
Each shipment of a pecies i considered a unit. It has not been possible to get all shipments of a species uniform as to size and length of logs, etc. Logs of one species differ greatly,
of course, from those of another in size and character. The method of grouping material is
influenced by 11 number of factors, such as size of logs, number of kiln runs in which each log
is to be represented, method of sawing (plain or quarter- awed), thickness of material to be
dried, and number of logs in shipment. C nsequcntly it was impo sible to adopt a single
standard plan for cutting, marking, and grouping; each shipment had to be studied separately and the method best suited to it adopted.
Figure 1 (A) to (E) illustrates everal of the methods of cutting log. Figure 1 (E) shows
how the logs of Sitka spruce of shipment 504 were divided. These logs were so large that
it was necessary to split them before they could be sl1wed. They were first split into quarters.
Each quarter was then split circunlferentially into two pieces and thc outer one of these pieces
was again split radially into two pieces. The re ulting 12 pieces were sawed a shown. The
central flitches HL and MK were cut into sticks 21 by 2l inches in the rough. Matched specimens for test in the green and air-dry conditions were provided in accordl1nce with the following
scheme : With an 8-foot log or double-length bolt a a unit, two flitches extending through
thc tree in one direction, as in figure 1 (B), or in each of two direction, as in figure 1 (E), are
cut into 21 by 2-t inch sticks. Tho e are numbered as in figures 1 (B) and (E), the number
consisting of a letter and a figure, as H3, L6, etc. Those sticks are then grouped for test as
follows:

That is, two composite bolts are formed , each including half the sticks from the upper
bolt and half those from the lower bolt. The sticks of one of these composite bolts are tested
green and those from the other after air-drying.
Figure 1 (D) shows how planks are divided into sticks for static and impact-bending tests
after having been dried in the kilns. In general, half of the sticks of any given group-green, airdried, or from any kiln run-are tested in static bending and half in impact. One specimen
from each stick is tested in compression parallel to grain. One-half of the static-bending
sticks furnish smaller specimens for compression-perpendicular-to-grain tests; the other half
give specimens for hardness tests. Shear, cleavage, and tension-perpendicular-to-grain specimens are taken from impact-bending sticks.
Figure 1 (A) and (0) are cutting diagrams as used for African mahogany and white ash,
and are typical of diagrams for logs which were cut into I-inch material or were not sufficiently
large to be cut as in figure 1 (B) or (E).
INSPECTION OF STOCK.

Immediately previous to being placed in the kiln all material is very carefully inspected
and any defects and imperfections noted and marked on the piece or made a matter of record.
On removal from the kiln it is again inspected and record made of any increase in the previously
noted defects, such as extension of shakes, increase of checks, or loosening of knots; also of
warping and cupping, the development of new checks, etc. It is also examined for casehardening.
KILN DRYING AND TESTING.

Following the initial inspection the material is placed in experimental kilns and dried. On
removal from the kilns it is stored for a brief period, after which the standard tests as previously
enumerated are made.
METHODS OF ANALYSIS.

We come now to a discussion of the actual comparison of the test data on material dried
under different kiln conditions and in the air. Because of the several influencing factors which
have been enumerated, this comparison can not be made directly from a table of properties in
which these properties are grouped according to the seasoning conditions. The reason is that
in the case of the preliminary analysis the air-dried stock used for comparison was not inherently
like that kiln-ell'ied. The trees and the parts of the trees are necessarily different and the
localities of growth are, in general, different also. In the final analysis the tests of the several
kiln runs and the air-ell'ied were on matched stock; that is, on stock inherently the same. Thus
the source of possible error in making a direct comparison introduced by unlike stock falls away.
However, differences in moisture content still usually exist at the time of test.
IMPROVEMENT RATIOS.

In attempting to find for use in the preliminary analysis some basis of comparison which
would, as far as possible, avoid the errors resulting from inherently different material in the
groups compared, study of the available data showed that the change in properties which is
produced by drying is in general somewhat less variable than the strength values. Accordingly,
it was believed that the effect of kiln drying could be better judged by comparing the change
which it produced with the corresponding change produced by air drying than by comparing
strength values of the kiln-dried and air-dried material. The mathematical measure of this
change is defined as an It improvement ratio."
t'
Improvement ra

10 =

Strength value for kiln or air dried material
Same strength value for matched green material

Early tests of the effect of moisture on the strength properties had shown that in one
species, at least, the effect of moisture change was practically independent of the specific gravity
of the wood. On the other hand, the strength properties are very largely influenced by the
specific gravity. Although the relation of specific gravity to strength has been the subject
of considerable study and important principles have been deduced, it is not pos ible to make
adjustment of strength figures for differences in specific gravity with sufficient exactness for

the present purpose. Hence, it seems that comparisons are likely to be less affected by differences in specific gravity if based on improvement ratios than if based on the strength properties
themselves.
ADJUSTMENT FOR DIFFERENCES OF MOISTURE CONTENT.

In some instances the strength properties of wood change very rapidly with changes in
moisture. Some strength properties of some species are nearly tripled in drying from the green
condition to about 8 per cent moisture. In other instances, however, the strength properties
are decreased in drying. After wood has passed the fiber-saturation point,! a change of 1 per
cent in the moisture content may produce as much as 7 or 8 per cent change in the strength
value. Consequently, since it is impracticable to bring the various groups of material which
are to be compared to the same moisture content before test, it is essential to the accuracy of
comparisons that careful attention be given to adjustment of strength values for differences of
moisture content.
Several years ago a rather comprehensive study of the relation of moisture content to the
strength of wood was carried out by the Forest Service at laboratories then maintained at
Yale niversity.2 This investigation, however, covered comparatively few species, and not all
the strength properties of these. In taking up the analysis of the data on the effect of kiln
drying on strength, the need of a general moisture-strength law which would be applicable to
all species and all properties became apparent. For the purpose of developing such a law the
existing data were very carefully reviewed.
Figure 2, taken from Forest Service Bulletin 70, illustrates the relation between moisture
and several strength properties of red spruce. The graph for modulus of rupture is seen to be a
curve from zero to about 30.5 per cent moisture, beyond which it is a straight horizontal line.
This shows that as moisture increases strength decreases until a point is reached where there is
no further decrease. This point (30.5 per cent in this case) is termed the fiber-saturation point.
At this point the cell walls are completely saturated, but there is no free or excess water in the
pores of the cells.
In studying data as given in Forest Service Circular 108 and Forest Service Bulletin 70 on
the several species and properties, it was found that when the logarithm of the strength property
was plotted against the percentage moisture the points could be averaged, with but comparatively little error, by a straight line. rrills was so consistently true that the application of the
principle involved to other species and to other propertie was thought to be justified. The
relation as found may be stated mathematically as follows:
s= Ox lOAM
where S is the strength value at any moisture content, M, below the fiber-saturation point, and
o and .A are empirical factors. It has been assumed that the type of curve represented by the
above equ ation is applicable to all properties, to all species, and to all drying conditions. Tho
differences between these various curves are represented by the constants (0 and A) which
adapt the type equation to specific instances. These constants for any specific case are derived
from the data to which the equation is to be applied. The following equation, derived from
that given above, is conveniently applicable to improvement ratios:
Ms-M2
L og R 2= M.-Ml X L og R 1

where M. = moisture content at fiber-saturation point.
Ml = moisture content of air-dried or kiln-dried material at time of test.
M2 = moisture content to which it is desired to adjust improvement ratios.
Rl = improvement ratio of dry material at moisture content of Ml'
R2 = improvement ratio adjusted to moisture content M 2 â€¢
The factor Ohas been eliminated in the derivation of this equation.

The fraction

~:~~l is the

value of A . In other words, the value of A for use in the adjustment of a set of data is derived
from the data.

The use of this formula is illustrated by the following example:
The average modulus of rupture of a certain group of material tested at 9.0 per cent moisture
was 10,240 pounds per square inch. The modulus of rupture of the corresponding green material was 4,890 pounds per square inch. The fiber-saturation point is 23 per cent. What

and

R 2 = 1.88
Also, modulus of rupture at 11 per cent=4,890 X1.88= 9,400 pounds per square inch.
As stated above, improvement ratios and methods of adjusting them for moisture are made
use of in preliminary analyses where it is necessary to compare kiln-dried material with airdried ml1terial from a different source. They are I1lso found very convenient in comparing
kiln-dried material with the air-dried materil1l actun.lly matching it. These latter groups are
seldom at the same moisture content whon tested; consequently adjustment for moisture is
necessary. This adjustment is made a trifle more easily on improvement ratios than on the
strength properties themselves.
DISCUSSION BY SPECIES.I

The various species on which tests have been made will now be discussed individually.
This discussion will be divided into two parts, corresponding to two groups as follows:
Group 1.-Species on which data are available from tests on matched groups of green,
air-dried, and kiln-dried material.
GroulJ 2.-8pecies on which data are not yet available on air-dried material matching that
tested green and after kiln drying.
Group 1 consists of Sitka spruce, Douglas fir, western white pine, and white ash.
Group 2 includes white pine, Norway pine, western hemlock, white fir, Port Orford
cedar, bald cypress, Central American mahogany, African mahogany (khaya sp.), northern
and southern white oak, southern red oak, black walnut, sugar maple, and yellow birch.
The kiln-dried material of the first three species of group 1 will be compared directly to
air-dried material matching it. Western white pine will be used as an example of the two methods of analysis. It will first be discussed and analyzed as if tests on the air-dried material
matching that which was tested after kiln drying were not available. It will then be discussed on the basis of comparison of kiln-dried material with air-dried which is matched to it.
This plan will afford a comparison of the two methods of analysis.
Since group 2 consists of those species in which data from tests of air-dried material matched
to that kiln dried are not yet available, conclusions must necessarily be made by the method
first illustrated under the discussion of we tern white pine. Data on the various species of
this group are not included. Only conclusions reached and recommendations based thereon
are gIven.
1 The species names used herein are those official in the United States Forest Service except the following: Central American mahogany
(Swietenia mahagoni), which is offiC
ially termed "mahogany;" African mahogany (Khaga sp.), for which no official name has been adopted by

the Forest Service; and "commercial white ash," concerning which see rootnote, p. 53.
The official Co=on and botanical names for the other species are: Sitka spruce (Picea Bitchensis), Douglas fir (P8tudo~a taxi/olia), westÂ·
ern white pine ( Pinus manticola), Port Orrord cedar ( Chammcypuriil laW8oniana), bald cypress ( Taxodium di8tichtÂ£m), western hemlock ( T8tÂ£(/a

saccharum), yellow birch (B etula luteal. Other common and botanical names applied to the various species are given in Forest Service Bulletin
17, "Check List olthe Forest 'I'rees of the United States."

It is not the function of this monograph to discuss kiln-drying schedules; consequently only
such data concerning the drying in these experimental runs as is essential to an understanding
and interpretation of the results of the strength tests are included. Neither is it intended that
the various graphs of kiln conditions should furnish comparisons of the various processes with
respect to rate of drying. For such discussions and comparisons the reader is referred to a
monograph by H. D. Tiemann entitled "The Kiln Drying of Wood for Airplanes" and published as one of this series. It is also desired to emphasize the fact that the runs described
herein were experimental and are not presented as models, nor necessarily as recommended
practice.
SITKA SPRUCE.

Becautle of the importance of Sitka spruce as an airplane material, more experimental
kiln drying has been done on this species than on any other. The results of 13 kiln runs made
with different combinations of temperature, humidity, circulation, and other factors which may
affect strength properties are available for analysis. The first three runs are those which have
been previously mentioned as preliminary. These runs were made on partially air-dried
rough plank. Because of the fact that the material tested was quite limited in amount, and
the further fact that the other runs have furnished much more comprehensive data, it is unnecflessary to present the data on these preliminary runs.
SOURCE OF MATERIAL.

The other 10 runs, on which full data are available, were made on material sent to the
laboratory in the log form, in three different shipments.
Shipment 504 consisted of SL,{ 8-foot logs from four trees grown in Clatsop County, Oreg.
They ranged in diameter from 53 to 77 inches. Trees 1 and 2 were each represented by two
8-foot logs, namely, bolts c-d \ and i-j for tree I, bolts a-b and i-j for tree 2. Trees 3 and 4
were represented by the e-f bolts only. Material from trees 2 and 3 was used in kiln runS
88 and 89, while trees 1 and 4 supplied stock for runs 91,93, and 94.
Shipment 563 came from Portland, Oreg. Much of the material was used for special
drying teo ts which it is not the purpose to consider here. The hipment furnished material for
runs 147 and 14 .' data and discussion of which are included in thi publication.
Shipment 578 consi ted of six logs, from as many trees, and varying in diameter from 60 to
66 inches. Trees I, 4, 5, find 6 were represented by the a-b bolts, tree 2 by the c-d bolt, and
tree 3 by the e-f bolts. Trees 2 and 3 furni hed material for kiln run 163, while material from
the other trees was equally divided between runs 171 and 172.
Previously tested green and air-dried material, with which compari on i made, Wfi . secured
from one tree from Â·Chehali COUll ty, Wah.
CUTTING AND MARKING.

The cutting and marking of Sitka spruce has been previously described (see pp. 15 and
17) is illustrated in figure 1 (E).

run and the humidities were higher. (See fig . 3.) In order to get uniform temperatures quickly
throughout the planks, runs 88 and 89 were begun with an initial steaming of four or five hours
at temperatures of 130Â° and 150Â°F., respectively. The very frequent rise in temperature in kiln
run 88 (see fig. 3) were due to faulty control apparatus. The stock from both runs appeared
to be in excellent condition at the close of the drying, and there was no degrade due to checking,
warping, or ca ehardening. Casehardening had developed during the latter part of the drying

one of one hour duration.1
Kiln run 91 and 93.-Kiln run ' 01 and 93 were made in the same kiln as run 89, so that
figure 5, which illu trates the piling and the arrangement of kiln parts for run 9, will suffice for

The material in run 91 was steamed twice to relieve casehardening. These steamings were
made at 180Â° F . for two and one-ha.lf hours and for one hour.
No casehardening was found at any time in the material dried in run 93, and therefore
steaming was unnece sary.
Kiln run 94.-The kiln arrangement and method of piling used in kiln run 94 are shown in
figure 6. In this run the stock was dried, not in the form of 3-inch planks, but in sizes suitable
for airplane beam planks. The load consi ted of 3 by 4, 2 by 3, 2 by 4, and 2 by 5 inch pieces,
all 8 feet in length. The 3 by 4 inch pieces
were piled as hown in the diagram, using
1 i -inch stickers and leaving about 3 inches
between the sticks of each tier. The 2-inch
material was similarly arranged in a separate
pile behind that shown in the figure, the kiln
being twice as long as the sticks to be dried.
The same size stickers and spaces were u ed.
The run was mild and practically a repetition
of the temperatures and humidities of run 93
(see fig. 3). The final moisture content was
9.6 per cent, and there wa no visible degrade
nor any casehardening at any time during the
run.
Kiln run 147.-Run 147 was also made
on pieces of small size. The e were roughsawed sticks 2! inches square and 4 feet long.
The ends were dipped in an asphalt paint to
prevent drying from the ends. The piling was
open and on a slant, as shown in figure 7.
The material developed slight casehardening,
which was relieved by steaming twice at a
temperature of 160Â°, as hown on the temperature and humidity curves of figure 4.
Kiln run 148.- The other kiln run on
stock of shipment 563 was numbered 148.
This was made for the explicit purpose of
finding the effect, on both appearance and
strength, of high temperature drying with
moderate humidities. The load was a large
one for the ize of kiln, consisting of 2,400
board feet of 3-inch plank, which were flatpiled with no spaces between the planks. The
kiln was of the type shown in figure 6. The
kiln conditions and average moi ture contents
of the samples are shown in figure 4.
Kiln runs 163, 171, and 172.-0Â£ the
FIG. 7.-Sootion of kiln showing method of piling Sitka spruce, kiln

the two runs numbered 163 and 172 were
practically the same with respect to piling and the temperatures used. Both runs were made
in water-spray kilns. The arrangements of the kilns and the locations of the measuring and
controlling instruments were practically the same as is shown in figure 6. The stock was in the
form of 2!-inch planks, 8 feet long, and valied in width from 6 to 18 inchcs. The piling was
flat, with It-inch stickers and with 2-inch spaces between the planks of each tier.
The stock of run 163 was given a preliminary steaming of two hours at 155Â° F. in order to
warm the planks through before drying conditions were established. The temperatures, humidities, and the average moistures for the six samples varied from day to day according to the

curves of figure 4. There was a 2 per cent degrade in this run, due to warping and to surface
checking in the sapwood of some of the planks.
Run 171 was a constant-temperature run, the temperature being 150 0 F. except during
the last three days, when it was 156 0 F.
THE Am DRYING.

Material of shipment 504, matching that kiln dried in runs 88, 89, 91, 93, and 94, was air
dried in the form of sticks 2~ by 2~ inches by 4 feet, the ends being carefully paraffined to prevent end drying. It was dried for about one year, from midsummer 1917 to midsummer 1918
in a shed without artificial heat. The shed was open on the north and closed On the other three
sides. The specimens were piled about 7 feet above the ground, midway between the ground
and the roof of the shed. The conditions thus secured were considered as favorable for perfect
air drying as are obtainable. When stored for drying the average moisture content of the group
of sticks matching two of the kiln runs (88 and 89) was about 49.1 per cent, and for another
group of sticks matching kiln runs 91, 93, and 94 about 41.5 per cent. The final moisture contents, after the material appeared to have reached constant weight, as indicated by periodic
weighing of samples, were found to be very uniform and somewhat higher than was anticipated. l
For six samples they were 14.0,14.3,14.2,14.3,14.3, and 14.5 per cent, giving an average of 14.3
per cent. The moisture at the time of test was nearly 2 per cent less, since some time necessarily
elapsed from the time of removal from the drying shed, during which time the sticks were stored
indoors in a warmer and drier atmosphere.
STRENGTH DATA.

The conclusions which are to be drawn regarding the effect, on the strength of Sitka spruce,
of the various conditions of seasoning just described are based on the study of a series of tables
givrng both the mechanical properties of the various groups of matelial and the improvement
ratios. The ratios are further presented in graph form for the sake of ready intercomparison.

â€¢ Specific gravity based on oven-dry weight and volume as tested.

The mechanical properties of all the groups of material for all conditions of seasoning are
given in the single Table 1. An additional special table of data for comparing runs 147 and
148 is Table 9. These properties are average values of the average for all tests from each
double bolt, or 8-foot log. For example: It has already been mentioned that kiln run 88 was
made on material from three logs of shipment 504. They were the ar-b and i-j bolts of tree 2
and bolt e-f of tree 3. The average property was determined for each bolt separately and the
values given in the table are the averages of the bolt averages.
The four succeeding tables (Tables 2 to 5 inclusive) tabulate improvement ratios. They
are obtained by different groupings of the data according to the points to be brought out. The
first three of these tables (2, 3, and 4) pertain only to shipment 504, for which the air-dry tests
completing the work h ave been made.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

Table 2 presents ratios derived from the properties of material of shipments 325 and 504
as presented in Table 1. Ratios are given both with and without adjustment for moisture
content. The next table (Table 3) was made up for the reason that the original data showed
a consistent variation in the strength properties according as the test specimens came from
near the central or the outer portions of the tree. It was thought that better comparisons
between kiln-dried, green, and air-dried material would be had by using smaller units of matching-that is, by groups more inherently alike. Table 3 gives by inner and outer portions the
properties of each bolt. (" Outer" and "inner" portions are divided by the circumferential
splitting lines as illustrated in fig. 1 (E).) The improvement ratios included are based on
a verage values of properties of bolts.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

Improvement ratios based on a still further subdivision of the unit for matching are shown
in Table 4. These are derived from some of the values shown in the preceding table. Only
the extreme lower and upper bolts from among those available are included, so that the trees
2 and 3, having only the bolts e-f, are not represented. Tables 3 and 4 serve the purpose of
detecting differences, if any exist, between the effect of drying on material from different parts
of the trees, and are useful in supporting the conclusions reached from the study of ratios based
on the general properties shown in Table 2.

AN N U AL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE F OR AERONAU T ICS.

The improvement ratios for m aterial from shipments 563 and 578 (Table 5), for which
the air-dried m aterial is not yet ready for test, are obtained in a somewhat different manner .
The ratios are computed for individual double bolts, but without sub division into inner and
outer portions fo1' each kiln run. The averages for the ratios for the several bolts are then
regarded as the improvement ra tios corresponding to the kiln run. The ratios were so derived
for kiln runs 147,148, 163, 171 , and 172, and are shown in Table 5.

The improvement ratios as given in T ables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 are put into graphical form
in figures 8, 9, and 10. Figure 8 also shows ratios for air seasoning of a closely allied species,
red spruce, based on data from a bulletin of the Forest Service. l In figure 8 the values plotted
for previous air-dry tests of shipment 325 and the values of improvement ratios shown by dotted
lines (shipment 504, kiln r uns 88, 89, 91, 93, 94) are from Table 2. The last five ratios under
each property are the average values t aken from T able 5. Ratios from Table 3 are also graphed
in this figure .
The ratios of Table 4 are plotted in figure 9. Figure 10 shows the ratios, by individual
bolts, for runs 147 and 148, from Table 10. This figure is included because of th e bearing of
these ratios on the question of the effect of high temperature.
DISCUSSION.
COMPARISON OF KILN-DRIED WITH MATCHED AIR-DRIED MATE RIAL.

The outstanding fact indicated by figure 9 and by that part of figure 8 pertaining to m aterial
for which air-dr y tests are available (shipment 504) is the 'V ery general excellence of the m aterial
which has been kiln dried, as compared in each case with the corresponding air-dried stock.
Irrespective of the unit of matching, whether matched by units of three whole bolts, by the
mner and outer portions for three bolts, or by inner and outer portions for individual bolts,
1

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

the excellence of the kiln-dried material is general
with respect to all of the five properties.
The conclusions as to the relative merits of the
various kiln runs are:
(1) Of the two runs 88 and 89 made on the
same group of material, 89 is the poorer, although it
is better than the corresponding air-dry except in compression parallel, and possibly also in height of drop.
(2) In the other group of material (including
runs 91, 93, and 94) kiln run 94 shows, with most con_
sistency, the highest improvement ratio. Taking all
the properties into consideration, it is difficult to choose
between runs 91 and 93. If, however, we base a decision on the highly important properties of work to
maximum load and height of drop, it would be concluded that run 91 is the better, in spite of the higher
temperature used throughout the run.
It will be noticed that the air-dried material of
the group matching runs 88 and 89 shows about the
same improvement over green as does that of the
group matching runs 91, 93, and 94, and that they
differ considerably less from each other than they do
from the air-dry of the previous shipment, 325. The
property which is an exception to this statement is
the very variable and less important one of modulus
of elasticity. This brings out the point that, while
the relative suitability of the several kiln runs can be
determined by intercomparison of the improvement
ratios, it is not possible to state positively that any
of them give improvements equal or superior to those
to be obtained by air drying until matched air-dried
material has actually been tested. To illustrate: If
tests on the air-dried groups matching kiln runs 88,
89, 91, 93, and 94 were not available, and judgment
of these runs had to be based on a comparison of their
improvement ratios with those of the previously tested
air-dry of shipment 325, and without any allowance
for variability, the condusion would b e reached that
of these runs 94 alone had yielded stock equal or
superior to air-dry. It is now evident that such a
comparison would be misleading. It so happens that
in this instance this method of comparison is safe, in
that it does not give a false idea concerning the safety
of kiln-drying. On the other hand, it might happen
that such a comparison would lead to the conclusion
that a given drying process was entirely safe, when
such was not the case. However, in making such
comparisons careful consideration must be given to
the variations to be expected. This was done in the
first analysis of the effect of runs 88,89,91,93 , and 94,
and the conclusion was reached that, with the possible
exception of run 89, all had given satisfactory results.
That all the runs, 89 included, have given satisfactory results is indicated by the data presented herein.

The above conclusions h ave b een arrived at by a consideration of the ratios shown in
figures 8 and 9, mentally balancing a deficiency in one property against superior excellence in
another. While it is necessary to exercise care in any attempt to reduce comparisons to an
exact mathematical basis, it is interesting to note how comparisons on such a basis lead to
practically the same conclusions as given. Table 6 1 gives the results of a computation of the
" efficiencies" of the various runs.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

Table 6 is derived from figure 8 and with its footnote is self-explanatory. The arrangement of kiln runs in order of descending weighted average efficiencies as obtained from Table 6
is as follows:

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Tables 7 and 8 pre:sent data similar to those of Table 6, but derived from figure 9. They
show efficiency figures for various sma.ller groups of material. Tables 7 and 8, as would be
expected, disclose considerably greater varia tions than are shown in Table 6. The averages
naturally show variations from those of Table 6. In no case, however, is the drop of these
averages below 100 per cent serious. Some rather low " efficiencies " for individual properties
are found among these figures for smaller groups of material. It is notable, however, that
there are few cases in which both work to maximum load an d drop, or both modulus of rupture
and maximum crushing strength, fall low. It is doubtful also whether such variations as are
found in these tables can be supposed to be the result of the kiln processes. It is more probable that they result from actual inherent differen ces between the kiln-dried and air-dried
material. Such differences are more likely to occur between small groups than between large
ones. In other words, the differences between small groups of tests are likely to have little
meaning, find conclusions as to the effect of the kiln proce as can best be reached from consideration of the larger groups.
Table 6, then, leads to the following conclusions, which are practically the same as those
previously s ta ted:
1. Runs 88, 91 , 93 , and 94 have produced material equ al or superior to material that was
air-dried.
2. Run 9 is probably the poorest of the runs , but may be considered practically equal
to the air-dry.
From os. 1 and 2 would follow:
3. Within the limits used, ll5Â° to 180 0 F ., the strength properties of Sitka spruce are
independent of the temperature of drying (but see following paragraph).
As has been mentioned, it is to be expected that a given process or set of drying conditions
will have a different effect on different groups of material from the same species, and that it
may be possible for a process to be safe for one group an d very damaging to another. This
expectation has been fulfilled in this series of tests, and consideration of some of the runs yet
t o be discussed necessitates a considerable modification of conclusion No.3 above.
DISCUSSION OF RUNS FOR WHICH DATA ON MATCHED Am- DRIED MATE RIAL ARE NOT Y ET AVAILABLE.

Consideration i now to be given to material from additional kiln runs. Air-dried material
matched to that dried in these runs and tested is no t yet available for test.
Runs 147 and 148.- Two of these runs (147 and 148) are particularly worthy of
at tention.
Run 147 was made on pieces 2t by 2t inches in section , by 4 feet long. The temperature
was 130 0 F. at the beginning and 150 0 F. at the end. The humidity and steaming treatments
were so regulated as to keep casehardening at a minimum. Run 148 was on material from the
same logs as run 147; material was in the form of wide planks 2! inches thick and the temperatures were 160 0 F. initial and 180 0 F. final.
Strength data for these runs are given in Tables 1 and 9. Improvement ratios are shown
in Table 5 and in figure 8. These improvement ratios are based on all the material in each
run as compared to corresponding gre~n material, and serve for a general comparison of these
two with other runs.

Figures better suited to the comparison of runs 147 and 14 are given in Table 9. Improvement ratios derived from them are given in Table 10 and gnliphed in figure 10. These
data differ from those of Tables 1 and 5 and figure chiefly in that run 147 included no material
from the central portions of the various bolts, so that in making Tables 9 and 10 and figure 10
tests on material from such central portions dried in run 148 were excluded in order to get the
best possible comparison of the two runs.

I. R. ~ Impro vemen t ratio.

Comparisons of runs 147 and 148 (see fig. 10) in modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity,
and maximum crushing strength are erratic when individual bolts are considered, but 148
averages better than 147 in each of these properties. I n work to maximum load and height of
drop, the results are (contrary to those for small groups from the runs previously considered)
consistent and quite largely in favor of run 147 . This leads to the conclusion that run 148

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

damaged the material in work to maximum load and height of drop! as compared t o similar
material tested after drying in run 147.
That the results of run 147 are in all probability entirely satisfactory is concluded from comparison with the groups of air-dried maoorial (fig. 8)2.
Runs 163, 171, and 172.-Runs 171 and 172 compare very favorably with the other runs
and with groups of air-dried material, except in height of drop, where they seem to be quite low.
Run 163 seems to fall below runs 171 and 172, and, in fact, below a number of the
groups of material graphed in figure 8. No definite conclusions concerning these runs can be
drawn until the corresponding air-dried material has been tested.
GENE RAL COMPARISON OF RUNS .

Table 11 affords a means of comparing all runs. It is made up in a manner similar to
Table 5, except that it gives for each run a weighted average improvement ratio instead of a
weighted average" efficiency." "Efficiency" figmes can not, of comse, be obtained in advance
of tests on corresponding air-dried material.
Table 11 indicates practically the same thing as has been brought out previously with
respect to the relative merits of several of the kiln runs. It does not, however, indicate an
appreciable difference between runs 147 and 148. It indicates that 163 is the poorest of all,
and rather distinctly inferior to air-dried material. Very probably Lhe apparently very poor
results on run 163 are only an example of variability explainable through the fact that run 163
was on different material from the other runs. Runs 163, 171, and 172 were made on material
from the same shipment, but 171 and 172 involved other trees than 163. Figmes such as are
given in Table 11 fmnish quite accurate comparisons b etween two or more groups of material
from the same trees. Comparisons between groups of material from different trees must,
however, be modified to take into account the variations which are likely to occur.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
PHOTOGRAPHS' 0F FAILURES.

Plates I to IX, inclusive, show failures of impact-bending sticks from various kiln runs
and from some air-dried material. Plates I, II, and I II, pertaining to run 148, are of particular
interest. The possible value and interest of such photographs was not suggested until the
time of the testing of these sticks. It is unfortunate that similar photographs from earlier runs,
particularly 147, are not available.
Of the failures shown in Plate I more than one-third would be judged to be of the highest
type and in no way indicative of the brashness shown by the data of Tables 9 and 10 and figure 10. In Plate II but one or two of the failures are at all indicative of brashness, and it is
difficult to believe that this material has been injured. That such is the case, however, seems
to be very definitely shown by the test results. All but one, or possibly two, of the failures
shown in Plate In are indicative of very poor material.
Plates IV to VII show failures of sticks from runs 171 and 172, and of corresponding green
sticks. Failures of air-dried sticks corresponding to kiln runs 8 and 89 are shown in Plate VIII,
and to runs 91, 93, and 94 in Plate IX. Comparison of these various photographs fails to indicate any difference between the air-dried and kiln-dried material with respect to types of
failure.
Plates I, II, and III as brought out by the comment on them and comparison with the
strength data show that reliable conclusions as to the effec.t of kiln drying can not be attained
by inspection of failures.
RESUME FOR SITKA SPRUCE.

Because of the importan ce of Sitka spruce as an airplane material, and in order to set forth
the methods of analysis used and to illustrate the difficulties met and the caution necessary in
making such an analysis, the data on Sitka spruce have been discussed in greater detail' than is
considered necessary for the other species.
Data concerning 10 kiln runs are presented. These 10 runs include 5 r uns, material
from which is compared to matched material tested after ail drying, and 5 for which data on
matched air-dried material are not available.
It is shown conclusively that Sitka spruce can be kiln dried without loss of strength as compared
to air drying.
In connection with this and other conclusions stated in this report it is desired to call attention to the fact that the material which was kiln dried is compared to material air dried under
conditions probably much more favorable to good results than is ordinarily the case. This
material was also air dried in small sticks (2!- by 2t inches in cross-section). This procedure
is undoubtedly more favorable to the retention of maximum strength than is ail' drying in wider
planks, as is ordinarily done. In fact, casehardening of sticks of this size was purposely
attempted in one kiln run (not discussed herein) but without success.
Data on the first five runs fail to disclose any consistent relation between the temperatures
used in drying and the strength of the resulting material, and taken by themselves would lead
to the conclusion that temperatures up to 180 0 F. can be safely used. There is, however, quite
conclusive evidence of damage to material dried in one of the other runs made with temperatures between 160 0 and 180 0 F. Taken as a whole, therefore, the data presented do not justify
the use of temperatures as high as 160 0 F. Definite evidence as to what is the critical temperature which, should never be exceeded is not afforded.
It is believed, however, that the data presented justify the conclusion that the temperatures of
specification 20500-A (120 0 F. initial to 145 0 F. final) are entirely safe.
There is no evidence of the extreme brashness which has been claimed to result from kiln
drying.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

Because ot the possibility of damage from higher temperature and the fact that as the
scheduled temperature is increased the danger of damage through accidental departure from
schedule increases, it is recommended that the temperatures of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A
(see Appendix A of Report No. 65, " Kiln Drying of Wood for AiI~planes") be not exceeded
in the drying of Sitka spruce for airplane stock.

DOUGLAS FIR.
SOURCE OF MA'tERIAL.

J'he material for the four experimenta.l runs on Douglas fir was derived from ] 0 trees
which were grown along the lower Columbia River, in Clatsop County, Oregon, at an elevation
of about 1,500 feet. Each tree was represented by two 8-foot logs, an upper bolt (h-i, i-j, or
m-n) and a lower bolt (a-b), making in all twenty ( -foot bolts. The logs varied in size from
31 inches to 39 inches in diameter and were from 300 to 350 years old. This material constituted shipment 523.
The logs were sawed into 2-inch and 3-inch plank of yarious widths. Specimens for test
in the green and air-dried conditions were obtained from two flitches extending from side to
side and nearly through the center of each -foot log. (See fig. 1 (B).) The sticks from each
8-foot bolt were grouped as outlined 011 page 15.
The remaining material was divided among the four kiln runs. Figure I (B) is an example
showing how planks for test after kiln drying were selected. Figure 1 (D) hows how these
planks were divided into test specimens and how the latter were marked. Table 12 is a
schedule showing the distribution of material from these 10 trees among the four kiln runs.
Previously tested green and air-dried material, with which compari ons are made, was secured
from two trees.from shipment 315, two from hipment 31 , and one from shipment 35-1.
These shipments were from Lewis County, Wash., Lane County., Oreg., and Humboldt County,
Calif., respectively.

DESCRIPTION OF KIL Â·DRYING CONDITIONS.

Figure 11 is a graphical representation of the kiln conditions and of the moisture contents
of samples of the stock for the four runs 99, 101, 102, and 103.
In every case material went into the kiln soon after cutting from the log and before any
appreciable drying had occurred.
Kiln 1'Un 99.-The charge for run 99 consisted of two hurrclreel twenty-nine 2 by 3 inch, 4
by 5 inch, and 3 by 4 inch pieces. Arrangement of the kiln was practically the same as shown
in figure 7 (kiln run 147), except that the stock was flat-piled with 2 to 3 inches between the
pieces in each layer. Two-inch stickers were used.
Mter a preliminary steaming at 130 0 F. for four hours, drying was started at 120 0 F. and
about 90 per cent relative humidity. Temperature and humidity were gradually changed, as
shown by the curves, to about 125 0 F. and 55 per cent humidity at the end of the run.

A "NUAL REPORT NATIO.r AL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Casehardening, though not apparent at the close of the run, was discovered after removal
of the m aterial from the kiln. It was accor dingly reloaded, steamed for two and one-half
hours at 150 0 F. for the removal of casehardening, and then redri ed.
I nspection showed that less than 1 per cent degrade occurred in this run.
Kiln run 101 .- Run 101 was made in a curtain kiln the arrangement of which is shown
ill figure 12.
The charge consisted of 2-inch and 3-inch material of various widths and derived from
the same bolts as tha t for run 99.
After a preliminary steaming at 120 0 F. drying was begun at 105 0 F. and 80 per oent
relative humidity. These conditions were gradually changed, as ShOVV11 by figure 20, to 120 0

on the sixteenth day to remove casehar dening.
Less than 1 per cent degr ade occurred, as shown by inspection before and after kiln drying.
Kiln run 102.-The arrangement of the kiln for run 102 was practically as shown in figure
5 (run 89), The stock consisted of 2-inch and 3-inch planks of variou widths. After preliminary steaming at about 165 0 F. the temperature was raised to about 180 0 F., where it was
kept for the remainder of the run. The initial humidity (after steaming) was 80 per cent.
Steaming at 180 0 F . was used once to r emove casehardening.
Kiln run 103.-Figur e 13 shows the kiln arrangement for nm 103. The stock was 2-inch
and 3-inch planks of various widths. After preliminary steaming at 138 0 F . drying was begun
with a temperature of 117 0 F . and relative humidity of 85 per cent. These conditions were
gradually changed to 1420 F. and about 37 per cent relative humidity at the olose of the run.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
THE AIR DRYING.

Test specimens 24. by 2,. inches by 4 feet, matching the various kiln runs, were air dried
for about eight months, from February, 1918, to October, 1918, under practically the same
conditions as similar Sitka spruce specimens (see p. 25), when they were found to have reached
practically constant weight. The average moisture content at time of storing was about 31
per cent. The moisture contents of the samples at the end of the air-drying periods were
about 12 per cent.
STR ENGTH DATA.

Table 13 gives the average mechanical properties of the green and air-dried Douglas fir
previously tested (shipments 315, 318, and 354); and also-by butt and upper bolt classesof material from kiln runs 99 and 101 , and from runs 102 and 103, with green and air-ru'y to
match each pair of kiln runs.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

DISCUSSION.

Inspection of figure 14 indicates that of the four kiln runs, 101 alone has given results
which can be considered fully equal to air drying. This run falls below the corresponding
air-dried material in three instances: Modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, and work to
maximum load, all for material from upper bolts. The deficiencies in these instances are so
small that they are entirely offset by superior excellence in other respects.
Further inspection shows that run 102 is very consistently, modulus of elasticity being the
only exception, inferior to the corresponding air-dry, and is, upon the whole, the poorest of
the four runs. These conclusions are supported by the figures presented in Table 15. Air
drying is taken as the standard of efficiency, or 100 per cent. The efficiencies of air drying
and of the several kiln runs, the latter as obtained by averaging the figures of Table 15 (A)
with those of Table 15 (B), are as follows:
Per cent.

Reference to figure 11 shows that the above list is in order of increasing temperatures; i. e.,
as temperature increases, efficiency decreases.
If the values for efficiency with respect to work to maximum load and maximum drop
only, as given in Table 15 (A) and (B), be averaged (without weighting) we getPer cent.

The order is as before, and the deficiency is less in runs 99 and 103, but somewhat greater
in run 102.
These figures all point to a rather definite relation between strength properties and the
tempern.tures used in drying. In no case is the deficiency sufficient to be considered an obstacle
to the use of such material for ordinary purposes. However, any failure to equal air-dried
material must be looked upon with considerable suspicion when stock is to be used for aircraft
construction.
Tests of the effect of various steps of pTeservative treatment on Douglas fir have shown
that this species is especially susceptible to injury by high temperatures. Data on such tests,
together with those given herein, furnish the following for correlation of temperature and
strength:

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The data on the four kiln runs as given in Table 1.5 (A) and (B) and as presented in figure] 5
indjcate that 120 0 F. is about the critical temperature for Douglas fir in th e green state. The
data drawn from Bulletin No. 286 by showing a continual decrease of strength properties with
increase in temperature support this indication.
CONCLUSIONS.

In view of the points brought out in the above discussion these conclusions are reached:
(1) There is a quite definite relation between the strength properties of Douglas fir and the

temperatures used in drying it. (2 ) About 120 0 F. is the critical temperature above which
damage is likely to result. (3) The decrease of strength properties with increase in temperature
is gradual. (4) The maximum damage to be expected from the use of Table 1 of Specification

FIG. IS.-Relation between strength properties of Douglas fir and temperattlle applied t o the green wood.

20500-A does not exceed 5 pel' cent. In all probability the susceptibility to damage by heat
decreases as the moisture content decreases, so that even this damage is not really to be expected.
(5) When maximum safety is desired, as for aircraft material, it seems doubtful if the temperature of 120 0 F. should be exceeded before the material is reasonably dry. (6) It is to be
expected that Table 2 of Specification 20500-A will produce material fully equal to that air dried.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

It is recommended that the temperature of Table 2 of Specification 20500-A should not be
exceeded in drying Douglas fir for maximum strength value. Humidities used should be such
as to keep checking and casehardening to a minimum. Steaming as permit ted by Specification
20500-A would be expected to have no harmful effect.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

WESTERN WHITE PINE.
SOURCE OF M ATERIAL.

Four experimental kiln r uns have been made on material from two shipments of logs.
Shipment 488, which furnished stock for kiln runs 95 and 110, consisted of logs from 24 trees
cut in I daho. These logs were 10 to 20 inches in diameter and too knotty to be considered of
airplane grade. Test specimens were, however, so selected as to be unaffected by the defects
and were representative of the clear wood.
Shipment 570 furnished stock for kiln runs 149 and 150. This shipment consisted of
seventeen 16-foot butt logs sent to the Laboratory from Keeler, Idaho. These were of better
quality than the previous shipment and were 18 to 36 inches in diameter.
Data on these two shipments are compared with data from green and air-dried material
from one log of shipment 224. This shipment came from Missoula County, Mont., and was
tested prior to the beginning of the present series of tests.
CUTTING OF STOCK.

The logs of shipment 488 were cut into 8-foot bolts, which were subdivided similarly
to the logs of commercial white ash. (See fig. 10.) The resulting planks were cut into 2 by
3 inch, 2 by 4 inch, 2 by 5 inch, and 3 by 4 inch stock.
Table 16 shows how the material was divided for drying in two kiln runs.
The 16-foot logs of hipment 570 were sawed in a manner imilar to that shown for Douglas
fir in figure 1 (B). Material for test green and after air drying was derived from a 2t-inch
flitch extending through the center of each log. Half of the remaining material from each log
was dried in the form of 2t-inch planks, of various widths and 16 feet long.
DESCRIPTION OF Kll..N DRYING CONDITIONS.

Figure 16 shows graphically the kiln conditions and the moisture content of samples of
stock for the four runs 95, 110, 149, and 150.
Run 95.-The charge consisted of 2 by 3 inch, 2 by 4 inch, 2 by 5 inch, and 3 by 4 inch
pieces derived from shipment 4 8. (See Table 16.) The arrangement of the kiln was much
as for run 147 of Sitka spruce ( ee fig. 7), except that the material was flat piled. The piling
was open (2-inch stickers and 2! to 3 inches between the pieces in the layers), with the 2-inch
stock on top of the 3-inch.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVI SORY COMM ITTEE F OR AERON AUTICS.

The run was begun with 41 hours' preliminary steaming at 90 0 t o 135 0 F. Temperatures
and humidities were as shown in figure 16. The irregularities in these factors during the first
few days were due to derangement of controlling apparatus. As shown by the curves of figure
16, the samples of 2-inch stock reached a satisfact ory dryness and it was removed from the
kiln three days ahead of the 3-inch stock.
Consid.erable troubl e was experienced from lack of uniformity in drying. This was largely
due to wide variations in the initial moisture content of different pieces and to apparently
nonuniform distribution of moisture lenthwise of individual pieces.

F IG . l 6.- Kiln conditions for western white pine, kiln runs 9S and 110 (shipm ent 488) and 149 and 150 (shipment 570).

Some slight evidence of casehardening was found near the end of the run. It was not
sufficient, however, to necessitate steaming.
Run 110.-The charge for this run, as for 95, was of 2 by 3 inch , 2 by 4 inch, 2 by 5
inch, and 3 by 4 inch pieces derived from shipment 488 (see Table 16). Arrangement of the
kiln and piling of stock was quite similar to run 95. Spaces between pieces in the layers were,
however, only one-half to three-fourths of an inch .
After preliminary st~aming at 135 0 F. for 18 hours, drying conditions were established
and continued as shown by figure 16. As in r un 95, considerable trouble was experienced
because of nonuniformity of moisture distribution in the charge. This cond.ition obtained both
at the beginning and at the end of the run. The closer piling was perhaps in part responsible
for the longer drying period than in run 95. F urthermore, because of the very high moisture

content of one sample, raising of temperature and lowering of humidity were delayed longer
than in run 95.
Run 149.- The charge consisted of 3 by 3 inch, 3 by 5 inch, and 3 by 8 inch pieces, 16 feet
in length, derived from shipment 570. Material wa flat piled on It-inch stickers with 2-inch
spaces.
The very long time required for this run is due largel y to the fact that it was made in an
experimental kiln in which a fan circulatory system had been devi ed and which had not yet
been rendered controllable. Circulation was very poor and r esulted in nonuniformity of temperature between different parts of the kiln. Slight ca eharci.ening was relieved by stpaming for
one hour at 1 50 F. on the thirtieth day. No caschardening was evident at the close of the run.
Run 150.- The charge consisted of 3 by 3 inch, 3 by 4 inch, and 3 by 5 inch pieces, 16 feet
in Jength and of various widths, derived from shipment 570. The material was close-piled on
a slant, with It-inch stickers. Material was steamed for one hour on two occasions at 180 0
and 174 0 F., respectively, to relieve casehardening. Slight casehardeningwas present when the
material was removed from the kiln.

Material was stored for air drying under conditions similar to those for Sitka spruce and
Douglas fir, as previously described.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYI NG ON STRENGT H OF AIRP LANE WOODS.
DISCUS SIO N AND CONCLUSIONS.

As mentioned on page 20, western whi te pine is to be used as an example of the two methods
of analysis:
1. First or preliminary analysis based on comparison of kiln-dried and previously air-dried
material by means of the increa e in strength properties produced by kiln drying as compared
to the previously observed increa e from air drying.
2. Second analysi based on comparisons of matched kiln and air-dried material.
FIRST ANALYSIS.

As the example of thi::; ill t analysi::;, the di::;cus"ion, conclu ions, and recommendations
substantially a given in a report made when the data of Table 19 and figure 18 only were
available will be repeated here .
Discussion.-Figure 18 shows t hat th e improvemen t in strength prop erties produced by kiln drying, with the
exception of work to maximum load, is practically as great as is secured by air drying as determined by previous t esta
from a single tree.

ai;-dried slock of a previous shipment (sltipmcnt 224), weStern wltite pine.

Apparen tly air drying produced in the material of this one tree exceptional improvement in work to ma..'{imum
load . This belief is supported by the fact that in most if not all cases other coniferous woods have shown less increase
in this prop erty. Also the actual values for work to maximum load for the air-dried material of this one tree is higher
than for any other conife rous species except the very heavy and dense ones, such :is longleaf pine. Furthermore, it
is the general, but not invariable, rule that deflection to maximum load should decrease in air drying. Data on
deflections to maximum load are given in Table 20.

AN N UAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVI SORY COMMITTE E F OR AERONAU TICS .

From the foregoing it is concluded that the increase in ',ork to maximum l oad obt ained from the one tree previously
air dried is abnormal and t hat the improv ement of the kiln-dried material in this respect has probably been a~ great as
would have resulted had the same material been air dried .
Conclusions.-It is concluded , then, that in all probability runs 95 and no have produced as good results as would
have resu lted from air drying the same material. The conditions in these runs were less severe than pcrmitted by
pecification 20500- A in that the specification admi ts of lower humidities than were 11 ed near the end of the run.
However, the high humidities maintained until the end of the runs (in no because of the very high moisture content of
a single mple) are not believed essential to the preservation of strength properties. A lower humidity would perhaps
have shor tened the time of drying somewhat. Data on material dried in accordance with Specification 20500-A are
not yet available.
The di fficu lty experienced in these runs through large variations in moisture content of the stock. and through dryi ng two th icknesses toget her, emphasi zes the desirability of cla ifying material on the basis of moistu re content and size ,
and of drying each class separately. A rough moisture cl a,~sifi cation such as could be obtained by "hefting" each
piece as loaded into the kiln would probably expedite the drying.
Recom.mendaiions.-It is recommended:
1. That, until additional data on the effect of various temperatures and humidities on the strength of western white
pine can be obtained , Table 1 of Specification 20500-A be used for drying this species.
2. That con ideration be given to grouping material into two or more classes on the basis of moil ture content, and
to drying material of but one moist ure content cla in the same kiln charge or placing the material cont<li ning the most
water in the fastest-drying portion of t he kiln.
SECOND

A~ALYRIS.

Disc'ussion of runs 95 (Â£nd 110.- R eferring now L figure 17, it is seen that m aterial from kiln
o
r uns 95 and 110 excels matched air-dried mater ial in all properties except work to maximum load.
This is the property in which the kiln-dried material seemed to fall short wh en th e first an alysis
was made. However , this shortage is believed to be en tirely offs et by the superiority in drop
values and in other proper ties.
In fact , almost any reasonable weighting of proper ties and summing up of the effect of cU
'Ying on th e properties as a whole shows that the two kiln runs have been practically equal in their
effect, and have produced results fully as good as air drying.
The difference between r uns 95 and 110 and the corresponding groups of air-dried m aterial
ar e in all probability not are ult of the different methods of seas oning, but are actual inherent
differences in material, impossible to avoid.
'Uns 149 and 150. -I n the absence of air-dried material corresponding to runs
Discussion of 1
149 and 150 it is not possible, of course, to make positive statements in r egard to their eff ec t.
By comparison with th e improvement in the aU'-dried material of shipment 224 and 488,
th e r esult of these two runs seem quite satisfactor, . Mor eover , the l ack of any consist ent or
apparently appreciable superiority of one run over t he other, material for th e two runs having
been secm ed fr om t he same trees and being very much alike (compare "gr een to m atch kiln
r un 149" with " green to match kiln run 150," T able 17), indicates practical equality.
This equ ality, taken together with the fact that r un 149 was at a considerably higher temperature th an 150, migh t also be taken as an indication that, up to th e limits of run 149, no damage
from high temperatur es was t o be expected. Caution mu t be observed here, however. It is indicated by the long period r equired for drying in r un 149, and also shown by r ecor ds of this run, th at
circulation was not good. The n atural accompaniment f poor circulation is nonuniformity of
temp eratures in different parts of the kiln . H ence it is entirely po sible that some of the material
tes ted may not have been subj ected to as severe temper ature condi tions as are indicated in
figure 16.
It must be said that, in gener al, the kiln drying of western white pine in these run has not
been eminently satisfactory . This is attributed largely to the char acter or the material with
respect to moistur e content. As has been mentioned, moisture content h as b een found to b e
very nonuniform.
OoncZ
usions.-It is believed that the data presented herein jus tify the following conclu ions:
1. Western white pine can be kiln dried withou t, damage to strength proper ties.
2. Table 1 of Specification 20500- A can be depended on to ill'Y western white pine without
damage to strength proper ties.
R ecommendations .- I t is r ecommended that, pending the r esults of further tests, the temper atures of Specification 20500-A be no t exceeded in drying wes tern white pine, and that the
humidity and steaming be regulated to keep casehardening to a minimu m.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGT H OF AIRP LANE WOODS.

COMMERCIAL WHITE ASH ..

Eight kiln rlms (81, 82, 83, 90, 96, 97, 92, and 100) have been made on white ash to show
the effect of drying under various combinations of temperatures and humidities.
SOURCE OF M ATERIAL.

Shipment 499 consisted of partially air-dried rough planks furnished by one of the airplane
companies. This furnished material for runs 81, 82, and 83, which included both ash and Sitka
spruce and are previously mentioned as "preliminary r uns."
Shipment 505 consisted of one log from each of 33 trees from southeastern Arkansas.
Three logs were 12 feet long and the remainder 16 feet. Top diameters ranged from 13 to 23
inches and the average total taper from top to butt of log was 61 inches.

Am DRYING.

Material was air dried under conditions similar to those previously described for Sitka
spruce and Douglas fir.
STRE GTH DATA.

Average strength values for the various groups of material are given in Table 22.
Table 23 gives the improvement ratios for the more important properties of the air-dried
material and for that dried in the various kiln runs, both without adjustment and after adjustment to 10 per cent moisture. Each ratio given in this table is based on the average of all the
material of any kiln or air dried group, as compared t o the average from the corresponding green
material.
Figure 22 presents in graph form the adjusted improvement ratios of Table 23.
DISCUSSION.

The absence of complete data, i. e., green and air-dried matching that kiln dried; on runs
81, 82, and 83 makes it necessary that they be judged by comparing the improvement they
have produced with that produced in ail' drying the other groups. Proceeding on this basis,
it is seen that 83 is normal or above normal in all respects, while 81 and 82 are quite low in
work to maximum load, and 82 is very low in drop. (See Table 22 and fig. 22.) It is concluded
that 83 has in all probability produced as good r esults as would be secured from air drying,
but that 81 and 82 have failed to give good results in work and drop values which are measures
of shock-absorbing ability and of great importance in airplane materiaL
Careful scrutiny of Tables 22 and 23 and figure 22 shows that runs 90, 96, 97, 92, and 100
are all fully equal to the corresponding air-dried m aterial in the important properties" work to
maximum load" and' drop '~; that all except 90 are equal or superior to air-dried in modulus of
elasticity; and that 96 only is fully equal to the air-dried in modulus of rupture and maximum
crushing strength. Furthermore, run 90 falls very considerably below air dried in these latter
properties. A resunle of the above amounts to this:
1. That the apparent" efficiency" of the kiln drying as shown in figure 22 and Table 24
is greatest for those properties which are least affected by changes of moisture content-work to
maximum load, drop, and modulus of elasticity-and least for those properties which are most
influenced by changes of moisture content-modulus of rupture and maximum crushing strength.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

2. That the run (90) showing the lowest apparent efficiency in modulus of rupture and
maximum crushing strength is the run in which moisture content of the kiln-dried material
is farthest below the corresponding air-dried material; consequen tly, for which adjustment of
moisture had to be made across the widest interval.
ow it is recognized that the methods of moisture adjustment, while the best that it has
been possible to devise, are not perfect, and it can be demonstrated that any errors in the
applicability of the fundamental assumptions underlying the methods of adjustment used will
have the largest percentage effect on the computed" efficiencies" as presented in Table 24, when:
1. Applied to those properties which are most largely affected by change of moisture
content.
2. The interval across which moisture adjus tment must be made is largest.

CO CLUSIO S.

From the above discussion the following conclusions are drawn:
1. Runs 81 and 82, made on partiftlly air-dried material at high temperatures (1 0 0 to 210 0 F.)

and with comparatively low humidities, resulted in rather evere damage to the important
properties of work to maximum load and drop. (It is notable that neither of these runs produced
any visible damage.)
2. Run 83 on partially air-dried material, and 90, 96, 97, 92, and 100 on green,at more moderate temperatures (initial 100 0 to 125 0 F. and maximum 120 0 to 160 0 F.) and omewhat higher
humidities, have all produced material praotically equal in mechanical properties to air-dried.
3. Results of thi latter group of kiln runs furnish no basis for coordination between severity
of kiln conditions and effect on mechanical value of the product.
4. From 2 follows the conclusion that Table 1 of pecification 20500-A i a safe schedule for
the drying of white ash.

60

OMl\lITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

RECOMMENDATION.

Itis recommended thatin drying white ash for use where the retention of maximum strength
is essential, the temperatures of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A should not be exceeded.
PORT ORFORD CEDAR.

Four kiln runs have been made on P ort Orford cedar.

The run were numbered 124, 125,

126, and 157.

Kiln run 124 subjected the tock to lightly milder condition than tho e specified in
Table 1, Specification 20500-A.
Run 125 wa made under rather severe high-temperature conditions. From an initial
temperature of 165 0 F. and a relative humidity of 0 per cent, near the fiber-saturation point the
temperature reached 175 0 F. and the relative humidi ty 40 per cent, ending with a temperature of
152 0 F. and a relative humidity of 35 per cent.
The temperatures and humidities called for by Table 2 of pecification 20500-A were used
as a basi for the conditions of kiln run 126.
] or kiln run 157, a practically constan t temperature of 120 0 F. with a relative humidity of
o per cent wa used.
PHYSICAL RESULTS.

The average moisture content of green material in all four run wa 35 per cent, with samples
from 124 containing 32 per cent, 125 con taining 38.2, 126 containing 35.5, and 157 containing
33 per cent. The moisture contents were reduced to 8, 4,8.2 , and 8 p l' cent re pectively. The
time varied from eight days for run 125 to thirty-eight days for run 157, with run 124 taking
nineteen days and run 126 twenty-eight days. Runs 124 and 125 showed practically no visible
degrade, while run 126 and 157 showed 3 and 8 per cent, re pectively.
MECHA NICAL RESULTS.

Comparison of kiln-dried material with previou ly tested air-dried material shows improvement ratios for the kiln-dried material lower in varying degree than for air-dried material for all
properties except maximum crushing strength in compression parellel to grain. The kiln
material approximately equals air-dried in modulus of elasticity in static bending, lagging slightly
behind air-dried material in modulus of rupture in statio bending, and dropping well behind the
air-dried for work to maximum load in static bending and drop in impact bending. There are
no appreciable differences in the improvem ents of the first three kiln runs, all being exceptionally
uniform. Run 157, however, is somewha.t erratic. It is noticeably higher than the previous
runs in improvement in work to maximum load, and noticeably lower in drop in impact bending.
CONCLUSIONS.

The previously tested air-dried material with wh ich the kiln-dried is compared came from one
tree only, and from evidence at hand it i concluded that it showed exceptional improvement
in air drying. It is therefore probable that the kiln-dried material gave as great improvement
as it would have done had it been subjected to a long period of air easoning. A comparison
of various kiln runs shows no significant difference in the improvement in strength values between the different runs, in spite of a considerable range of the temperatures used in drying.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

In view of the fact that positive conclusions can not be reached until tests have been made
on air-dried material corresponding to that kiln-dried, and the further fact that any lack of control of kiln conditions is more likely to result in damage when attempting to run by a high-temperature schedule, it is recommended that higher temperatures and lower humidities than those
of Table 1, Specification 20500-A, should not be used in drying Port Orford cedar, unless there
is urgent need for rapid drying, and then only in case the kiln operation is in charge of an experienced man.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

61

BALD CYPRESS.

One kiln run has been made on bald cypress. In this run 2 and 3 inch material was dried,
using the temperatures and humidities of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A. During the last two
weeks of the run it was not possible to reduce humidity below 40 per cent, thus causing a departure to that extent from Table 1. It was necessary to steam nine different times at temperatures
ranging from 150 0 to 176 0 F. for periods of one to five hours, to relieve casehardening. (Total
time of steaming 2H hours. )
PHYSICAL RESULTS.

The average moisture content was reduced from 91.8 to 7.3 per cent in 80 days, with an
average visible degrade of 8 per cent due to springing and warping.
The material from butt logs was found to dry much more slowly than that from upper logs.
MECHANICAL RESULTS.

The kiln-dried material gave practically as grea~ an improvement in static bending as
previously air-dried material, the former being noticeably greater in "work". The kiln-dried
material from lower bolts gave a greater improvement than that from the upper bolts in every
case except drop in impact bending. In this property, and also in maximum crushing strength
in compression parallel to grain, the air-dried material gave a greater improvement than the
kiln-dried material.
CONCLUSIONS.

It is not possible from results in one kiln run to form final conclusions on the proper method
of kiln drying this species. From data collected it is concluded that:
1. Upper-log material can be dried much more rapidly than that from butt logs, and the
two classes should be dried separately.
2. Cypress require more than ordinary care in drying in order to prevent checking, honeycombing, warping, and casehardening.
3. Cypress can be kiln dried so as to produce material equal in it mechanical properties to
air-dried n;taterial, but final judgment on this point can not be reached until matched material
has been air dried and tested.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

1. That butt-log material and material from upper logs be kiln dried separately.
2. That, pending the results of further test, the temperatures of pecification 20500-A
should not be exceeded in drying bald cypress, and that humidity and steaming be regulated to
keep casehardening at a minimum.
WESTERN HEMLOCK.

Two kiln runs have been made on 3-inch material of thi species. In one run the material
was dried by using temperatures and humiditie approximately as called for by Table I, Specification 20500-A (temperature 120 0 F. initial, and 145 0 F. final; humiditie 80 per cent initial,
and 35 per cent final). This resulted in decreasing the moisture content from an average of
79 per cent to an average of 6.7 per cent in a period of 33 days, with a resultant visible degrade
of 3 per cent due to opening up of checks.
The second, which was a high-temperature run (temperatures 160 0 F. initial to 1 0 0 F.
final, with humidities 70 per cent initial to 50 per cent final), compares favorably with the
fir t run both in time required for drying and in amount of degrade. The time was 19 days to
reduce the moisture content from 9 .4 per cent to .2 per cent, as compared with 25 days to
reduce to 4.8 per ce~t for the first run. The average visible degr'ade was Ie s than 1 per cent.
The fiT t run had only slight indications of casehardening on resawing, while severe casehardening was indicated in the second run.
MECHANICAL RESULTS .

The two runs are practically equal to each other and to previously-tested air-dried material
in improvement of modulus of rupture and work to maximum load in tatic bending. However,
in modulus of elasticity, while the high temperature run equals the air-dried, the Table 1 run falls

62

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY

OMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

considerably lower. Both runs fail to show impro vement equal to th at shown by previously
tested air-dried material in impact drop and compression p arallel to gr ain. Were it not for the
known facts concerning the va:.r iability of timber- and of improvement ratios as previously
brought out in this report- case of inieriority in im rovement to previously air-dried material
might be assumed to indicate actual damage re ulting from kiln drying. However, the fact that
the more severe kiln conditions have produced material practically equal in all and considerably
superior in some properties to that result ing from kiln drying under milder conditions is accepted
as the better basis of judgment. Groups of mat erial t ested after drying in the two kiln runs
are closely matched to ea h other ; henc e, comp arisons between the runs are much more accurate
and positive than comparisons 'with the air-dried material.
CONCLUSIO S .

The conclusion that neither kiln process damaged the material must be r egarded as tentative,
pending testing of matched air-dricd material, but it is believed that conditions scheduled in
Table 1 of Specification 20500-A are safe for drying western hemlo ck. Probably considerably
higher temperatures could be used without damage.
RECOM M ENDATIO S.

In view of the fact that positive conclusions can not be r eached until t ests have been made
on air-dried material corresponding t o that kiln dried, and th e further f act that any lack of control
of kiln conditions is much more likely t o result in d amage when attempting t o run by a higher
temperature chedule, it is reco mmended that T able 1 of Specification ~ 050 0-A be used in
drying western hemlock.
WHITE AND NORWAY PINE.
T

Material of both white and .1. orway pine was dried in each of two kiln runs. One run
was made with tempcrature varying from 180 0 to 200 0 F. and r elative humidity varying from
76 to 60 per cent. The second kiln nm followed quite closely the schedule of temperatures
and relative humidities of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A.
P HYSICAL RESULTS .

The result of the first run wa that thc white pine was dried from an average moisture conent of 99 per cent to an aver agc of 5.3 per cent and the Norway pine from 22.5 to 6 per cent
L
in a period of 16 days. Both pecies had a vi ible degrade of about 6 per cent, due mostly
to checking. The high temperature cau ed the pitch and resin t o flow to the surface and
harden.
In the second run the white pine was dried from an average moisture content of 99 per
cent to an average of 10 per cent and the Norway pine from '3 5.5 per cent to 8 .6 per cent in a
period of 67 days. Both species had a visible degrade of 6 per cent, due to checking, twisting,
and warping.
MECHANICAL RESULTS.

The results from the mechanical tests on mall clear specimens indicate that the two runs
produced approximately as good improvement in nearly all values as resulted from previous
air drying and that, in spite of the great difference in temperature, the two runs produced
about equally good results. The high-temperature r un gave considerably better improvement
in modulus of rupture and maximum crushing trength of Norway pine, and slightly better in
modulus of elasticity of both specie , while in other values the low temperature run gave
slightly, but not significantly, better improvement.
CONOLUSIONS.

It is concluded that there is no damaging effect t o be expected from temperatures as high
as were used in this instance. This conclusion , how ver, must be regarded a tentative until
confirmed or disproved by tests on matched material which is now air drying.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

Table 1 of Specification 20500-A is recommended for use in drying these species until
additional data can be obtained on the effect of various temperatures and relative humidities
on the strength.
WHITE FIR.

Two kiln runs have been made on white fir, in stock of 3-inch thickness and various widths.
The temperature in one run ranged from 160 0 F. initial to 180 0 F. final. The other run followed quite closely the schedule of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A, as shown in Table 25.

As determined from moisture contents of samples.

Kiln run 157.-This run was made in a kiln which had been equipped with fans to produce
circulation.
The material was steamed 1 hours at 136 0 F . before the kiln conditions given in Table 25
were established. Casehardening stresses which developed during the run made four additional steamings necessary, at temperatures of 135 0 to 160 0 F., for periods of one to two hours.
(Total time, six hours.)
Drying from an average moisture content of 100 to 8.2 per cent was accomplished in 57
days, with an average visible degrade of about 8 per cent. This degrade was the result of
twisting, warping, and surface checking.
Kiln run 158.-Thi run was started without preliminary steaming, but it was necessary
to steam six times (total time 19 hours) during the run to relieve casehardening. The steaming
periods ranged from one and one-half to six hours, at temperatures ranging from 170 0 to 1 2 0 F.
The material was dried from an average moisture content of 149 to 7.7 per cent in 12 days;
but. in order to relieve casehardening it was necessary to continue the run for 9 days, during
which the moisture content of the samples was reduced to 5.1 per cent. The moisture content
of the green material ranged from 69 to 208 per cent.
The material was in good condition on entering the kiln, although everal pieces showed
end and heart checks, shakes, and springing. After being dried the material came out with an
average degrade from warpmg, springing, twisting, and surface checking of approximately 6
per cent.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS.

The material was compared with various air-dried firs (silver, grand, and noble) as well as
white fir. In every case, except maximum drop in impact bending, kiln run 157 is superior to
the average of the air-dried firs. Kiln run 158 is somewhat lower than thi average in maximum
drop in impact bending and in maximum crushing strength in com pre ion parallel to grain.
Both runs produced material which was batter in improvement of trength propertie than
material from the one available tree of air-dried white fir, except in com pre sion parallel to the
grain. In this property the high-temperature run (15 ) was inferior to the air-dried material.
It appears that no significant damage OCCUlTed to the strength properties from either kiln
treatment, and it is probable that the Table 1 run (157) produced at least as good results as
would have resul ted from air drying.

64

AN NUAL RE PORT N ATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

1. P ending the completion of tests on air-dried material matching that kiln dried, it is
recommended that T able 1 of Specification 20500- A be used in drying white fir for use where
maximum strength is e sen tial.
2. If faster drying th an can be produced by folJ owing the above recommendation is necessar y, the temperatures as used in run 158 appear to be fairly safe, providing the humidity is
regulated to prevent severe casehardening.
3. Becau e of the large variation in moisture content of different boards of this pecies, it
is recommended that this m aterial be divided into two or more groups according to the weight
of the pieces, which i an indication of the m oisture content, and that either the groups be
kiln dried separately or the heavier material be placed in the most rapid drying part of the kiln.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

65

The material for all runs was approximately 1 inch in thickness.
The material for all n ns except 108 was steamed before drying was commenced, and all
runs except 106 were again steamed from one to four times to relieve casehardening. The
steaming for run 162, however, was to relieve only very slight casehardening.
MECHANICAL RESULTS.

African maho.qany.-A decided gain in improvement was made by all kiln runs over the
previously tested air-dried material in modulus of rupture and maximum drop. Work to maximum load, modulus of elasticity, and maximum crushing strength may all be considered equal
to the average of the air-dried in improvement.
No apparent damage is shown in any kiln rlll, and the material is considered to have made
at least as good improvement as would have resulted from air drying.
Central American mahogany.-Material from all the kiln r ns hows very good improvement in strength properties Over the corresponding green material. Improvement ratios are
in nearly every case as high as resulted from the air drying of material previously tested.
There appeal's to be but very little difference in the improvement for the various strength
properties produced by the different processes of drying.
DISCUSSION AND CO, 'CLUSIONS .

The satisfactory results from these kiln runs indicate that the temperature of both Tables
1 and 2, Specification 20500-A, are safe, as fo ur of the runs were made with temperatures
approximately those called for by Table 1 or 2, and one run subjected the to ck to severer
temperatures.
The consi tent though slight inferiority of the high-temperature run (107) to run 106,
which was made on material from the same trees, indicates a pos ible relation between strength
and temperature used in drying.
Run 162, the material in which was Central American mahogany, \vas made with temperatures closely approximating tho e of Table 1, but the relative humidities were not permitted
to drop below 60 per cent. This run produ ed material, -hich ras in excellent condition for
propeller stock and which was slightly better in improvement of strength properties than
material from the same shipment dried in run 161. While no run was made on African mahogany
using conditions similar to run 162, it is believed, since the two "ood are eemingly losely
related in physical properties, that such a run would produce pra tically the same results.
Special tests taken on this run howed even cros -sectional drying and very slight casehardening. These results indicate that the condition under which the material in run 162 was dried
is very satisfactory for drying propeller stock.
RECOMMENDATIO

s.

It is recommended that in drying Central American and African mahoganies, the temperatures of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A be used, but that the relative humidity be not allowed
to drop below 60 per cent at any time during the run.
BLACK WALNUT.

In order to develop a proce s of kiln drying black walnut sati factorily, two kiln runs were
made, one in accordance with Table 1 and the other in accordance with Table 2 of perification 20500-A.
The Table 1 run consisted of I-inch and the Table 2 of both 1 and 2 inch tock.
The Table 2 run was controlled by both 1 and 2 inch samples, which delayed the drying
process slightly as the 2-inch material dried very slowly. The ~-inch samples were discarded
from calculations during the last stages of the run and 'onditions better adapted to I-inch
stock were secmed. The material was steamed at 120 0 F. for six hours at the beginning and for
one hour at 150 0 F. at the end of the run, the latter to relieve casehardening.

66

ANNUAL REPORT

ATIO AL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The 1-inch material dried from an average of 72 to an average of 8 per cent in a period of
38 days, but 2-inch material in the same period reduced only to 18.per cent from 54 per cent.
The material entered the kiln with end and heart checks, heart rot, and springing, and came out
with an average degrade of about 7 per cent caused by springing, checking, and warping.
The condition of the second run during the final tages was slightly milder than required
by Table 1 of Specification 20500-A. The material wa frozen when loaded into the kiln and
it was necessary to thaw it out, by steaming, before drying could begin. Toward the end of
the run it was necessary to steam the material one hour at 150 0 F . to relieve casehardening.
At the beginning of the run the stock contained an average moisture content of 78.6 per
cent, which was reduced to 7.7 per cent in 31 days. It left the kiln in good condition, showing
a visible degrade of about 2t per cent caused by end checking.
CONCLUSIONS.

The improvement r atios show that, with exception of drop in impact bending, both kiln
runs produced greater improvement in strength properties than resulted in the case of the
previously air-dried material, and in all probability as good results as would have been obtained
by ail' drying the same material. As both runs follow closely Tables 1 and 2 of the specification,
it follows that either of these tabl can be expected to give satisfactory results when used for
drying 1-inch black walnut. The strength data give no basis for a choice between the two kiln
runs.
RECOMMEND ATION .

The work so far done gives, of course, no basis for judging the eff ct of conditions more
severe than Table 1. Until the elrect of more severe conditions can be ascertained, it is recommended that Table 1 of Specification 20500-A be used for drying black walnut.
SUGAR MAPLE.

Seven experimental kiln runs in the drying of sugar maple have been made, but only the first
three, 132, 133, and 134, have reached a stage where discu sion and analysis are possible and
figures are available.
The fil'st run (132) was on 1-inch material only; the last two runs (133 and 134) were on both
1-inch and 2-inch mn,terial. Run 132 was made to determine the effect of a practically constant
temperature of 170 0 F. and the same relative humidities as called for by Table 2 of Specification
20500-A; run 133 was in accordance with Table 1, and run 134 was in accordance with Table 2
of this specification. Runs 133 and 134 were both steamed near the end of the run to relieve
casehardening. N steaming wa necessary on run 132.
The high-temperature run (132) was made in Lhe least time, requiring 12 days, but had the
smallest difference between initial and final moisture contents, the initial moisture pontent
being 48 and the final per cent. This run had the large t average degrade-about 15 per cent.
The degrade was due chiefly t o warping, with some springing and twisting. Slight casehardening
was evident on resawing.
The Table 1 run (133) required 23 days, practically twice the time of the previous run, but
reduced the average moisture content from 56 to 5.8 per cent, with an average degrade of 11
per cent du e to cupping, warping, and springing, the gr ater portion being due to cupping. Very
little casehardening developed on resawing.
Kiln run 134 required 29 days to reduce the average moisture content from 56 to 7.5 per
cent, but had the smallest degrade of any run-about per cent, due to cupping and warping.
The material showed very slight reverse casehardening on being resawed.
RESULTS.

There is no marked or consistent difference in the mechanical results of the three runs.
The kiln-dried material showed improvement over matched green material equal or superior to
that pr eviously obtained by an' drying.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

67

CONCLUSIONS.

Absolu tely definite conclusions can not be reached until tests on cOlTesponding air-dried
material have been made; but the data warrant the conclusions:
1. That kiln drying can be carried on without injury of material, and probably with better
results than can be obtained by air drying.
2. That there are no consistent differences in the effects of the three run. This indicate
that a considerable range of temperature can be employed with little, if any, difference in the
effect on the mechanical propertie .
lECOMMENDATlONS.

Until the above conclusion (No.2) has been checked by te ts on corresponding air-dried
material, and because of the greater danger of damage through accidental departure from
schedules when operating at higher temperatures, it is recommended that maple be dried by
schedule of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A.
YELLOW BIRCH.

Five kiln runs have been made on yellow birch, a follows:
Run 84 was on 2~-inch plank, with temperatures 130Â° F. initial to 180Â° F. final, initial and
final humidities of about 77 and 13 per cent, 1'e pectively. The average moi ture content wa
reduced from 60 to 4 per cent in about 31 days. There was evidence of casehardening in some
parts of the pile at the end of the run.
Run 168 was on I-inch stock. Temperatures were approximately those of Table 1. Initial
and final humidities were about 80 and 35 per cent, Tespectively. Tho material was steamed
six: times, at temperatmes vary-ing fTom 150Â° to 165Â° F. and periods of one-fourth to Olle hour,
fOT the relief of casehardening, which persistently developed. There wa slight casehardening
at the end of the run. Uneven sawing, which prevented proper piling and weighting of the stock,
was chiefly responsible for the degrade of about 10 per cent. Moisture content was reduced
from 64 to 7.6 per cent in 16 days.
Run 169 was on I-inch stock. Kiln conditions were approximately those of Table 1,
Specification 20500-A. Steaming three time, at 160Â°, 170Â°, and 160Â° F . for three hours, two
hours, and two hours, respectively, near the end of the run, left part of the stock everely casehardened and part in a condition of severely Tever ed casehardening. Degrade wa about the
same as in run 168 and due to the same causes. Moisture content was reduced from 5 to 8
per cent in 17 days.
Run 170 was on I-inch stock, with kiln conditions approximately as prescribed by Table 2
of Specification 20500-A. Five steamings were made at about 20Â° F. above the acheduled drying temperatures. The stock wa practically free !Tom casehardening at the close of the run.
Degrade of about 7.5 per cent resulted from the same causes as in run 16. Moistme content
was reduced from about 65 to 8.2 per cent in 31 days.
Run 203 was made on I -inch partially air-dried stock. Kiln conditions were approximately
those of Table 1. Steaming for one hour at 160Â° F . on the eighth day and for two hours at 170Â°
F . on the tenth day successfully relieved the ca ehardening which had developed. The moisture
content was reduced from 18.5 to about 7 per cent in 10 days. There was about 5 per cent
degrade.
MECHANICAL RESULTS.

Comparisons by means of improvement ratios indicate that run 16, 169, and 170 produced practically equal improvement, and that thi improvement is equal to the average of
two trees previously air dried, being les than one and greater than the other. Imprqvement
in run 84 is less than the minimum for the previously air-dried materiaL Comparisons of run
203 with the others are di{fLcult to make because of the partially air-dried condition of the stocl
before it was placed in the kiln.

68

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
CONCLUSIO â€¢

The kiln conditions of Tables 1 and 2 produced re ults in the drying of yellow birch which
are equal to those to be expected from air drying.
It; seems probable that the one run at temperatures of 130 0 to 180 0 F. has failed to produce
as good results as would have been obtained from air drying.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

Both Table 1 and Table 2 of Specification 20500-A are recommended a.s suitable for the
drying of yellow birch.
OAK.

Seven kiln runs were made on oaks, including red and white oak species frOID the South and
white oak (presumably true white (Quercus albaÂ» from northern Indiana. The testing work,
inclusive of tests on air-dried material, h as been entirely completed. The data, however, are
very erratic and it is difficult to arrive at consistent conclusions.
One run (A), at temperatures varying from 150 0 to 165 0 F. and relative humidities from
85 to 60 per cent, produced very good resul ts from the strength standpoint on southern red
and white oak species, with the exception of Spanish oak. The charge was steamed for one
hour and two hours at temperatures of 179 0 and 170 0 F ., respectively, to relieve casehardening
stresses. However, this rtm r esulted in a degrade of 60 per cent as determined from inspection
before and after kiln cll'ying. The causes of degrade included severe casehardening, warping,
cupping, honeycombing, and collapse.
Two runs (B and C) on northern white oak gave entirely satisfactory results from the
strength standpoint. Run B was with temperatures approximately as prescribed in Table 2
of Specification 20500-A and relative humidities ranging between 90 and 70 per cent. This run
was steamed at 135 0 F. for one hour to relieve casehardening stresses. Run C was at temperatures
of 120 0 F. initial and 140 0 F. final, with relative humidities about 90 initial and 50 final. It was
necessary to steam this material three times, at temperatures from 160 0 to 164 0 F., for a total of
two and one-half hours, to relieve casehardening stresses at the end of the run. Both gave
results fully equal to air dry, with the lower temperature run (B) slightly the better. Material
in both cases came from the kiln in excellent condition, there being less than 1 per cent degrade
in run B and less than 1 ~ per cent in run C.
In another run(D), with temperature 90 0 F. ini tial to about 125Â°F. final and humidities ranging from SAturation down to 40 per cent, northern white oak came from the kiln with about 1
per cent degrade, r esulting from springing and warping. At the close of the run the charge
F.
was steamed seven hours at 155 O to relieve the casehardening stresse. Strength tests indicated
that this material ras slightly deficien t in strength properties as compared to matched airdried material.
Still another run (E), with initial temperature of about 100 0 F. to final 130 0 F. and humidities
ranging from saturation to about 45 per cent, resulted in about 7} per cent degrade. The material was steamed twice at 185 0 and 170 0 F. to kill mold and mildew. A final steaming at 180 0 F.
was to relieve casehardening stresses. This run, however, included southern red oak and both
northern and southern white oaks, and while the different species were not separately graded,
it was observed that the degrade was more serious in the red than in the white oak. Thenorthern
white oak from this run was also slightly deficient in strength properties as compared to matched
air-dried stock.
Southern white oak was includ'e d in runs A and E , as above described. Run A produced
quite satisfactory results from the strength standpoint., while run E resulted in a considerable
loss of strength as compared t.o air-dried material.
Two addit.ional runs, F and G, included southern white oak. Run F was made with temperatures of 105 0 F . initial and about 135 0 F. final and relative humidities 85 initial to about 40
per cent final-approximately the condition of Table 2. Run G was with temperatures of 120 0 F.
initial to about 140 0 F. final and with humidities as in F. These runs included also southern red

oak species. Run F was steamed three times for periods of one hour each, at 155 0 F., to relieve
casehardening stresses. The degrade in run F was 12 per cent, from warping, springing, and
cupping; while G resulted in 50 per cent degrade from springing, warping, cupping, checking,
twisting, collapse, honeycombing, and casehardening. Run G was steamed on three occasions
for periods of one-half hour, at temperatures of 150 0 to 170 0 F., to relieve casehardening stresses.
Run F gave quite satisfactory results from the strength standpoint, while in G the results were
unsatisfactory, there being a loss of 25 to 30 per cent in modulus of rupture, work to maximum
load, and height of drop in impact. Exclusive of Spanish oak, the results from the strength
standpoint were as follows:
Southern red oaks, including Spanish oak, were dried in runs A, E, F, and G. Run F produced approximately as good material as air dry, run G material considerably inferior to air dry,
and run E, as indicated by maximum drop in impact and maximum crushing strength in compression parallel (there being no static bending tests), material very much inferior to matched
air-dried stock.
None of these runs (A, E, F, and G) gave satisfactory results from the strength standpoint on Spanish oak. Runs F and G resulted in losses in all strength properties, with F possibly
slightly superior to G. Run A gave results somewhat superior to either F or G, while the results
in E were inferior to either F or G.
From the results as presented above it is concluded: (1) That under the same kiln conditions
northern white oak can be expected to dry with smaller losses, both from the strength standpoint
and the standpoint of degrade in appearance, than southern oaks, either red or white; (2)
that of the southern oaks thered oak species require more care than the white oak species ; (3)
that Spanish oak is considerably more liable to damage of strength properities in kiln drying
than the other red oak species from the southern region; (4) that, in general, the northern oaks
are more easily kiln dried than the southern.
It is evident from experience in these runs, and the conclusion is borne out by experience
in drying oak on a commercial scale, that the maintenance of suitable kiln conditions requires
more care in the case of oaks than in other species or groups of species. Oak has been found in
all experimentation with it, as well as in its utilization, to be morevariable than other species. To
attempt to specify beforehand exactly what kiln condition should be used seems unwise. The
results of these kiln-drying and strength tests indicate that the temperatures of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A are probably the maximum which are safe for northern white oak, and likewise
that the temperatures of Table 2 should not be exceeded in drying southern oak, either red or
white. In drying any of the oaks very careful attention must be given to the condition of the
stock in all parts of the kiln. Temperatures and humidities must be regulated not only by the
moisture content of the stock but also by its condition with respect to checking, casehardening,
the existence of a difference in moisture content between the outside and the inside of the piece,
and the existence of stressed conditions.
