SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION COVERED BY PRESENT TESTS.

The investigation described in this report was conducted for the National Ad visory Committee for Aeronautics at Leland Stanford Junior University, Palo Alto, Calif.
The investigation on air propellers carried on during the two years 1917-1 and forming
the subject of reports Jos. 14 and 30 1 of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
covered the following general characteristics of form and design:
Four nominal pitch ratios, viz, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.1.
Two forms of blade contour, (1) with approximately parallel sides and slightly rounded
tip and (2) curved and tapering in accordance with the common saber form.
Two mean width ratios, viz, 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the radius of the propeller.
Two forms on the driving face, viz, plane and cambered or hollowed.
Two forms of distribution of geometrical pitch, (1) uniform and (2) increasing radially
as determined by the assignment of a constant theoretical angle of attack.
In the study of the hollowed or cambered driving face, all combinations of characteristics
otherwise with a degree of camber measured by one-third the thickness of the corresponding
straight-face section were tested, while si.'C y,r:ith a degree of camber one-half the preeeding
were tried.
In the study of propellers with radially increasing pitch, this feature had not been extended
to those of nominal pitch ratio 1.1.
In addition to propellers with combinations of characteristics as indicated above, a
considerable number of tests were carried ou t, as recorded in report o. 30, covering a variety
of forms of blade contour combined with one or more combinations of other characteristics.
In continuation of this general program of investigation, it seemed desirable to examine
in particular the influence of the following characteristics:
(1) Nominal pitch ratio 1.3 combined with a certain number of the more common or
standard forms and proportions.
(2) Driving face slightly rounded or convex.
(3) Change in the location of the maximum thiclmess ordinate of the blade section.
(4) Pushing forward the leading edge of the blade, thus giving a rounded convex surface
on the leading side of the driving face.
(5) A series of values for the constant" angle of attack" in forming propellers with radially
increasing pitch.
In accordance 'w ith these purpo es tests have been carried out on some 2 propellers,
figure 1, having characteristics as follows
Four propellers of nominal pitch ratio 1.3; uniform pitch, straight face, and with four
combinations of form of blade and area as shown in Table 1.
Five propellers of nominal pitch ratios 0.5,0.7,0.9, 1.1, and 1.3, all of uniform pitch, one
area and one blade form, and with the driving face made slightly convex by adding a crown of
one-sixth the normal thiclmess of the corresponding straight-face sections, as shown in Table I
and in sections, figure 2.

Four propellers of nominal pitch ratio 0,7, uniform pitch , one blade form and area, and
four locations of the maximum thiclmess ordinate of the blade section, as shown in Table I
and in sections, figures 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Three propellers of nominal pitch ratio 0.7, uniform pitch, one blade form and area, and
with three degrees of deformation of the leading edge by pushing forward , as shown in Table I
and in sections, figures 7, 8, and 9.
TW'elve propellers distributed over the five pitch ratios 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, all with one
blade form and area and with radially expanding pitch derived from the assumption of varying
theoretical "angles of attack," as shown in Table I.
The foUT propellers 111, 112, 113, and 114, of nominal pitch ratio 1.3, fall in as the last
members of four series formed by the propellers having corresponding combinations of form
and area and with the other pitch ratios as tested in previous years.
The five propellers 115, 116, 117, 118, and 119, with the slightly rowlded driving face,
give a series representing a single blade form and area carried through the five nominal pitch
ratios as shown in Table I.
The f oUT propellers 120, 121, 122, and 123, with four difl'erent positions of the maximum
thickness ordinate of tho blade section, all of one pitch ratio, blade form and area, form with
the corresponding propeller ( o. 7) tested in 1917,1 a series of five propellers with five positions
of the maximum thickness ordinate, viz, 33 per cent, from the leading edge for No.7 (which
closely represents standard practice) and positions on either side as follows:
0.120, maximum thickness of ection 0.17 per cent of width from leading edge; No. 121,
25 per cent ; o. 122, 41 per cent; No. 123, 49 per cent. The combination of characteristics
otherwise (pitch ratio, form and area) selected for this serie was intended to represent an
average or typical case.
The three propellers, 124, 125, and 126, with leading edge pushed forward, give with o. 7
a single series with three successive amounts of such deformation, all of a single-type combination otherwise. I n No.7 the driving face is straight ; in Nos. 124, 125, and 126 the leading
edges are moved forward 25 per cent, 50 per cent, and 75 per cent of the maximum thickness
of section, respectively.
The 12 propellers, 127 to 138, show in T able I a single value for nominal pitch ratio and
two values for nominal pitch. The former is the pitch ratio of the driving face at 13-inch radius

and the latter are the pitches of the driving face at the 4 and 18 inch radii, respectively. These
propellers were given a radially increasing pitch according to the Drzewiecki method. For all
blades showing the same value of nominal pitch ratio the pitch of the driving face at the 13-inch
radius equals the diameter multiplied by the value of pitch ratio given. The following table
shows the assumed constant" angle of attack" which gives rise to the variation in nominal
pitch tabulated:

The contour, area, and section of propellers 127 to 13 are the same as for 3,7,11,15,19,

The first of each series has a uniform pitch; the second has a radially expanding pitch
produced by the assumption of a 3° "angle of attack"; the third one for a 6° "angle of attack";
the fourth one for a 9° "angle of attack."
All propellers in one series have the same geometrical pitch at the 13-inch radius. It
should be noted that the effect of an assumed constant" angle of attack" varies inversely
with the nominal pitch ratio. For instance, with propeller o. 127 (6°, 0.5 pitch ratio) the
pitch changes from 12.32 to 21.29 inches, a variation of about 43 per cent of the maximum,
while for propeller 137 (6°, 1.3 pitch ratio) the change is from 45.52 to 49.60 inches, a variation
of less than 9 per cent of the maximum.
CONSTRUCTION OF MODELS.

The model propellers were carved from single sticks of well-seasoned Pacruc coast sugar
pine (Pinus Lambertiana) in the manner previously described. A departure was made from
previous practice in the method of finish. After carving and sandpapering, the smooth bare
wood was given one coat of orange shellac. This wa rubb ed with fine sandpaper and the
surface given three to four coats of fiat gray vaint, put on very thin with a; camel's-hair brush.
Each coat was thoroughly dried and rubbed smooth, small surface d-efects being corrected with
a filler. The propellers were then given two coats of rubbing varni h, the first being rubbed
to surface with pumice and water and the second left glossy. The resultant finish is smooth,
thin, and hard. For photographing, a single coat of fiat gray was applied after tests were
completed.
AERODYNAMIC LABORATORY.

Tests on the present series of model propellers were conducted in the aerodynamic laboratory at Stanford University, California, during the month of eptember, 1919. The wind
tunnel is of similar form and proportions to that previously described/ but considerably larger,

having a throat diameter of 7.5 feet . It is of somewhat mor e substantial construction, being
solidly framed, and planked wi th i -inch thick tongue-and-groove flooring.
The wind fan is 15 feet diameter, with eight blades of 12-foot pitch. It is driven by a
laO
-horsepower, 220-volt, variable-speed, direct-current motor, with which, at 25 per cent
overload, a wind velocity of 80 miles per hour m ay be realized.
TESTS.

The tests were conducted in a similar manner to those described in the 1918 annual r eport.
Somewhat greater wind velocities were used, it b eing the practice to star t the test with a wind
velocity of about 45 miles per hom. After the safe limit of thrust (abou t 50 pounds) or the
power limit of the driving motor (12 horsepower) was reached with this velocity, observations
were made at higher slips by reducing th e wind velocity until the useful range of slip had been
covered.
.
The thrust-torque dynamometer and other device used in 1917 and l D were employed
18
in these present tests. The thrust b alance, torque springs, and wind-sp.eed meter were subjecteJ to frequent careful calibrations as previously.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS.
THRUST.
TIIRUST IN RELATION TO PITCII RATIO.

The curvos of T e for propellers 111, 112, 113, and 114 comparcd with those for propellers
with similar characteristics except pitch show that in general for a given value of
increases with pitch r atio.

At the lower values of

incr ement of thrust i less than that of pitch ratio and that the limit of thrust is soon reached.
This is shown most clearly by curves of

and XXIV.

is less than that for the same form, area, and nominal pitch, straight-faco blades 11, 7,

and 3 of the 1917 report, 82 of the 191 report, and 113 of the present series. A part of this
reduction of thrus t m ay be accounted for by the smaller dynamic pitch.
f
(b) Position o maximum ordinate.-Propellers 120, 121, 7 of 1917, 122, and 123 show that
for a given value of

section away from the leading edge, lmtil about 33 per cent of the width is reached. Beyon d
this there appears to be li ttle change in thrust, No. 122 showing lightly loss than No. 7 and
No. 123 nearly the same. The variation in thrust is perhaps not greater than would be expected
from the variation in dynamic pitch.

For propellers 11 , and 23 of 1917 and 127 and 128 of the present series, at a given value of

::v' the thrus t varies inversely with the" angle of attack."

The variation is not greater than

would be expected from the variation of dynamic pitch.
The same is true of series 7, 19, 129, and 130.
For series 3, 15, 131, 132; 82, 133, 134, 135; 113, 136, 137, 138; the differences are less
marked. In some cases it is in one direction and in some in the other. This is accounted for
by the fact that with the larger pitch ratios the variation of pitch is less than with the smaller
pitch ratios for the same" angles of attack."

POWER I N RELATION TO RADIALLY INCREA ING PITCH.

The two series 11 , 23, 127, 128, and 7, 19, 129 , 130 show the same general relations of power
absorbed as of thrust develop ed; that i , power varying inversely with the" angl of attack."
Also, as with thrust , the differences in the larger pitch ratio are small. In the case of series
113, 136, 137, 138 ther e is lit tle difference between the tor que curve. It is sometimes in one
direction and sometimes in the other.
EFFICIENCY.

EFF ICIENCY I

RELATION TO PITon RATIO .

The 1.3 pitch ratio propellers how a lar ger range of efficiency and a slightly higher maximum than similar forms t est ed in 1918 (1. 1 pi tch ratio) . There is a marked decr ease in efficiency at the higher slips, some bl ades showing an efficiency curve which i slightly concave

EFFICIE N CY I N R ELATION TO BLADE SECTION.

(a) R ounded f ace.-Pr opellers 115, 116, 117, 118, and 119 have practically the same efficiency curves as os. 11, 7, 3, 82, and 113 (s tr aight face) . Although the thrust developed is
less for the former , the power absorbed is pr oportionally less, so that the efficiency is little
affected. H aving slightly less dynamic pitch, a slightly less maximum efficiency for the r oundedface series is to be exp ected. It appears, however, that the str ength of blades may b e considerably incr eased by slightly rounding the face, and with little or no corresponding loss in effiClency..

of 1917, 122, and 123 show highest efficiency for Jo . 7, whose maximum or dinate of section is
one-third of the width from the leading edge. No. 121 appears superior to No. 120. Ther e is
little difference between os. 122 and 123, but bo h are distinctly less efficient th ,n No. 7.
(c) L eading one-third offace rounded by pushi leading edgeforward .-Pushing the leading
edge forwar d increases the maximum efficiency a tained but decr eases the efficiellcy over the
working r ange. The incr ease in m aximum efficien y is not more than would be exp ect ed from
the incr ease in dynamic pitch .

EFFICIENCY IN RELATION TO RADIALLY EXPANDI -G PITCII.

The :five series of propellers, 11,23,127,128; 7,19,129,130 ; 3,15,131,132; 82,133,134,
135; 113, 136, 137, 138, seem to indicate that no advantage in eiliciency is to be gained from a
radially exp anding pitch prQduced by the method of design followed. Although these series
show with incr easing" angle of attack" slight increa es in efficiency ovor the usual working
range, ther e is an accompanying reduction in maximum cffieioncy, both of which results are
to be expected from the -decrease in dynamic pi tch.
As wi th tbTust and power, the differences for the small pitrh ratios arc more marked thai!
tho e for tho larger ones .
