In audition to these tests, numerous modi-

made in the design of the JN4H and the effect

The conclusions ~awn may. howe-.,or, be sUllin3.l'izod here.
The balance of an airplane, and its degree of nose-heavi-

ness or tail-heavi~ss at any speed and throttle setting, can man- '
. !.festly be cieterminad by measuring the force whi ch the pilot must
apply at the upper end of the stick in steady flight . . This force
,

can al~s be modified in either direction and in aQY deojred degree by changing the st,abUlzer setting, and. th:l.S means of correction should be chosen inprererence to moving the C.G. relative to
the wings unless there is special reason for adopting the latter
plan.

The balance, as eXpressed by the force !'equired on the stick,

e.G.

this is not because the

but

is too far forward (it is, on the con-

trary, too far back) but because the statio moment of the elevators
about. the hinges. due to their own weight, is abnormally large,

Ai

and a large pull (about

lbs.) on the .tick is req,ulred to hold

the flipper's up, even when there is no downward air load on them.

Machines with adjustable stabilizers can, of course, be made to balance at any sp9ad by adjustment of the surface .
The stability with free controls can best be determined
by measu't"ing the force on the stick at a fiXed throttle setting and.

a number of different air-speeds and

plott~ng

the forces as ordi-

nat·es (a pull on the stick being taken as pos! tive) against the
air-speeds as absc::'esae.

The necessary and sufficient condltS.on

at any speed is then that the curve

of forces shall have a negative slope at that speed, and the steeper
the .negative s ).ope the greate!" the stability.

appears the n, that all of those machine s except tile Martin follow

the rule that a convex camber of the lower surface of the stabilizer
is favorable to stability at bigh

This is due to

the effect of the slip-stream on the controls, and it is interesting
to note that this effect exists in a marked degree even on the Martin, where only a small part of the tail-surface lies inside of
the slip-streams.

The most obvious means of counteracting this slip-

strecm effect is to raise the thrust-l5.ne, thereby Jiving rise to a
diviD6 moment when the en6 ine is on full which will counterbalance
the stalling moment due to the downward. b last of the slip-stream

on the stabilizer.

chan~e

The

in elevation of the thrust-line which

would. be required for complete balancing would, however, be too
great to be practicable on machines of ordinary type.

In a IN, for

example, the thrust-line would. have to be raised. a little more than

a foot with respect to the center of gravity in order that the

C~8S

With open and

It

is probable that one reason for the unusually small separation of

tha

$eva~al for~e out~e

in the Vought is the telat1vely low

poei.

tion of the C.G. in that machine, although the e.G. is not low
enough, relative to the thrust-line, to balance the slip-stream effect very completely.

In flying boats, where t he

e.G.

is far below

the thruBt-line, it is reported by pilots that the moment d.ue to
eccentricity of the thrust is more than sufficient t o balance that
due to the slip-stream effect, and the boats therefore tend to stall
when the throttle is cl osed and

div~

w
hen it is opened.

ThiS, of

course, is more objectionable than the oppo site tendency, but the
ideal condition would be half-way betwe en, one in which the airspeed with free controls remains constant at a speed slightly in excess of the speed of minimum required power.

Progress towards this

ideal condition can be made by tilting the e ng ine down a t the front,

as on the JN4A, or, on a s i ngle-el1t;,ired machine, by incre a si ng the

Ithat the elevator allglea are equal to

those on the LePere.

With the

l ed down to a positive angle of from 2° to 4°, whereas on the La

, Pere it has to be pulled up to a negative angle to the wings and

the machine is still tail-heavy.

The stiok forces required to balance

The conclusion is that the measurements of forces and an1
I

isles on the LePere. if interpreted in the ordinary wa.y, lead. to
: diametrically opposite conclusions, and that the two sets of data

only be reconciled by taking account of the balancing portion

lot the elevator hitherto ignored.

Since the center of pressure of a flat plate or

s~etri-

cambered surface approaches the leading edge as the angle ap-

proaches zero, it is evident that, if such a surfaCe be hinged anywhere back of the leading edge, the curve of C.P. travel will eross
the line ot the hinges at least twice during the range of angles
· normally used.

Such a surface is used on the LePere, and, wh<3n it

is observed that the balanciIlg portions are in a pOSition where

they carry a much larger unit pressure than a.D¥ other part of the
elevator, it

~ears

highly probable that the elevator is overbal-

aneed under some conditions.

If this be the Case, it would fully

in the control forces, a8 the effect

be produced by a down load with the center

ot pressure forward of the hinge, quite as well as by an up load

applied behilld the hinge.

In view of the difficulty experienced with the balance
of the LePere fighter and of the considerations just stated, I
strona1y recolImend that the effect of eliminating the balancing
part of the elevator and adding that area to the stabilizer be
tried.
