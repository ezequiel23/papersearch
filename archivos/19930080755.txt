The strength of a countryts air service does not depend simply on the number of its pilots and machines, but d.sO ~

the char-.

acter of its factqxies and its stationary plants (parks, airdromes$
etc.).

It may even be said that the latter elements are the most

immediately necessary~,for? though it is possible to imPrQvise *
air fleet quite quicklyz as during the war> it is a much slower
and more costly process to create the inner structure which alone
can ~iV= the xeqti~tiestability.
For nothing$ moreovet$ is there greater need of stations well
equipped with tools than for airships. Thus, on going ovet the
list of 7’3airship hangars~ which the Germans possessed at the time
of the armistice, and the stations they have created, not only in
Germany but also in Pol”a.nd$
Eulgaria, and Hungary> we can not help
thinking that a.cauntry possessing such elements

of aerial power

remains redoubtsble$ even though it has temporarily lost the airships once centained in these stations.. It also makes us realize
that our own country should have stations comparable with those of
its rivals.
In this conneotion, it is profitable to examine the orgsniza.

From this point of view, 1!
the advant~-es pre sented by orientable hangars (See llL1eronautiqu@,

In spite of these advantages.$the Germans employed

during the war only one movable hangars that at Nordholz. The dispositions made in various stations$ notably at Sch.neidemtil indij
cate however that, if circumstantes had permitted it} the employZ~iit

of revolving hangars w culd have been much more common.

It is,

in fact~ probable that the necessity of rapid and economical conto
struction led our enemies to resort.. the almost exclusive use of
stationary structures with simple metal frames.
M

glancing at the plan of a large German station> we are

first struck by the large space occuPied~ At Nordholz, about 1200
hectares (3000 acres) are occupie& by the maneuvering fie~da end
their dependencies.~ The hangars themselves seem to have been dr~pped w random on this vast e~mse~

one or the other of them is favorably situated for the entry or exit
of its airships.
There are evident advantages in such a plan for the ut ilizatiu<.
of the airships,,but unfortunately it leads to multiplying the hangars and distributing them over extensive fields. Besides, since
the most accessible hangars vary acoordi
ng to the directiOn of the
wind, it is necessary’jin order to ~“arantee”regular service) to
have in eaoh group one airship always reaciyto start, and a free
place for any airship returning to port unexpectedly.
The m@t

complete application of the above mentioae~ principle

is at the Nordholzistation which has> in addition to its rotary hang=,

three groups of hangars oriented.. 120° with reference to one
at

another. The distante between each group and the others is fr~
500 to 1000 m., making the maneuvering fields entirely En ~ep.enden~
corof one another. Theze is room in each group for foaz airslnip~)
res~onding normally to one on the point of d~garting3 two in yeserve
or being ‘repaire&end, lastly, to one place available for the reception of any airship returning to port.

Hanmar Accessories.

The existing large airships are about 225 m. long by 26 m.
wide and 30 m. high.

The newest German hangars are 260 x 75 x 40 z,.

and each can hold ,two airships side by side.

A double hangar has

great advantages. In the first place, it can be used as a single
hangar in case a rapit increase in the size of airihips should render it neaess~.

F@thermore, the maneuvers of entering snd leav-

ing the hangars would be facilitated by the.greater width between
the doorposts. On the other hand7 the risk is greater in case of
fixe.

.

Eaoh pair of hangars constitutes> in Geruany, an autonomous
7Pi201~$which is served.
by a standard-gauge railway and provided.

with storehouses and barracks.
This independent which is still further accentuated by the
ce,
considerable distante generally existing between the groups~ is advantageous from the milit~

point of vi.ewtsince it limits the

possible destructive effects of a fire ox bombardment.
subject to cziticism from the industrial point

It is more

of view:~because a

more compact arrangement.
would make it possible to reduce the number of plants and facilitate;
their operations beside~ conomizing

The hangars, considered individually, should> above all, be

designed with a vkiewto facilitating the care of the airships ccntained in them.

They should also be protected against fire.
