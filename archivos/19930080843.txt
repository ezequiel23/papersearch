TECHNICAL NOTE NO. 53.
SIMILITUDE TESTS ON WING SECTIONS.*
By
H. Kumbruch.
Translated from the German
by
D. L. Bacon, L.M.A.L., N.A.C.A.

The application of the results of model tests to full
size construction assumes either that the resistance varies
as the square of the speed within the range of speeds in question or that the mechanical similarity law is fulfilled by
the model test.

This latter requires, in addition to geomet-

rical similarity I that the relation of the airflow to the
model, both geometrically and mechanically, be exactly like
that for the large machine.
This relation holds, as Reynolds has shown, when the expre ssion Y..];, the so-called "Reynolds number" is the same both
v
for the model test and for actual flight. Here v signifies
air or flying speed, t

case the wing chord, v

. If,
as in the usual case, the model is tested in the same medium
as that in which the body is later to be propelled; then v

is

constant except for comparatively small changes with pressure

and temperature, so that the law of similarity is fulfilled
when the parameter

E

= vt

is the same in both cases.*

For

various sized but geometrically similar bodies with the same
parameter the same air forces will be developed.

Unfortu-

nately it often occurs that the parameter for full flight can
not be duplicated in the tunnel, because either the model
would have to be too large or the required wind speed is not
attainable.**

In such cases one must be content to determine

the relations between Lift and Drag coefficients and the parameter up to the highest possible values of

vt

and to ex-

trapolate for the forces on the actual machine.
The law of squared resistances states that air forces
are proportional to the square of the velocity.

This leads to

the following formulas for lift and drag coefficients: * * ~:
Drag

= Cw

~V2 =
F 2 g

Cw

F q

Lift = c a F -'1- v 2 = c a F q3
2 g

*

The numerical value of the parameter is here taken as the
velocity in meters per second multiplied by the specified
linear dimensions in millimeters.
(The Reynolds number,
an absolute coefficient, is about 70 times greater.)
** This method falls down even if very high wind speeds are
attainable because of the cr~tical ranges governed by
the compressibility of air and hence by the variable V
rather than the product VI (See Prandtl's comment on high
speed research by Caldwell and Fales, and blUe print A5

Aerofoils are always slender bodies in this sense.

Dimensions of model and speeds of tests must be so chosen
that at least a portion of the experimental curve lies above
the critical range so that no serious irregularities intervene
bet w
een the conditions of test and those of full flight.
It is always important to carry out the

Five different wing curves were investigated.

The same objection applies of course to the "surface qualityll
of the fabric and plaster covered wings.

In this respect ex-

act similarity is seldom reached.
In testing the two small models no noteworthy departure
was made from customary practice.

The methods used in the old

tunnel have already been described , *

those of the new tunnel

correspond with them in the most important features.

In both

cases the customary measuremepts of drag, lift and moments were
made.

The method of testing the large wings is shovm in Fig. 1.

The wing hangs on eight wires, four being attached to the front
spar and four to the rear spar.
to a beam

G

All eight wires are fastened

supported on a platform scale by means of which

t he sum of t he wire-pull s, i. e., the total 1 ift, is measured.
The position of center of pressure of the resultant was not determined.

The wires to the rear spar served as a means to ad-

just the angle of incidence.

The drag VIas measured by means

of the projecting ends of the front spar.
The large wings had, as stated, a 1.5 meter span and the
air strea,m had a width of 2.2 meters.

The effect of the re-

stricted width of the air stream on the forces (the law of
similitude assurnes an air stream of the infinite extent) and
the small aspect ratio of the wings (2.5) had to be eliminated.
For this purpose, in order to obtain as evenly distributed a
flow as possible across all sections of the wing, two vertical
walls 2.5 m. long by 2 m. high and extending above the air
stream were erected adjacent to the ends of the model wing.

Although the difference in

p ressure between the upper and lower sides of the wing tends
to cause a leakage around the wing tip this is effectively prevented by the smal l clearance and the labyrinth cells.
The end loss is thus eliminated and if the air stream w
ere
unbounded, both above and belo w, the measur ed drag would be only profile resistance.

Ho w
ever, the available depth of air

stream is only about 1 meter above and belo w the wing.

The considerable decrease of the drag coefficient with i n creased parameter is striking though not unexpected because of
similar results with other bodies.

In order to sho w the manner

in w
hich this decrease takes place the drag coefficient has

These part icular condi-

tions however are of but small practical importance .
The curves show that the parameters used in current practice yield somewhat too high values of the resistance coefficient.

A general expression for the value of the resistance

coefficient in terms of

E

is not yet available.

As soon as

more data are collected the relation between these two quantities will be more carefully investigated.

It is noteworthy

that the profile resistance coefficients measured for high values of

E

are noticeably smaller than the frictional resist-

ance coefficients no w being used.

One might try to explain

this by assuming that the discs and labyr i nths near the ends

of the wings gave rise to an up wind force because of the pressure difference, thus causing too low resistance measurements
to be made.

This explanation is unsatisfactory ho w

surely be no such up wind force, the p rofile resistance remains

It

is also possible that in evaluating the customary frictional
resistance coefficient an accurate distinction was not succes's fully made bet w
e0n profile and frictional resistance.

In sim-

iIi tude experiments no w being prepared this phenomenon will be
more fully investigated.

Preparations are like wise being made

for research on the frictional resist ance of smooth surfaces.*
The lift coefficients depend on the value of the parameter to a much less degree than do the resistance coefficients
(See Figs 3b to 7b).

For angles of incidence from 0 0 to 9

0

,

which is the range of practical interest, and for a parameter
greater than 4000 m/sec. mm. the lift coefficient may be assurned independent of the parameter.

Below this value the be-

havior of the different profiles varies.

For most of them Ca
* These friction tests have been completed and have confirmed
the accuracy of the usual friction coefficient. The cause
of the abnormally small profile resistance lies in the fact
that the induced resistance (see page 7) caused by the deflection of the air stream was calculated some ~hat too
large as the influence of the small clearance between the
Wing and the nozzle (about 1.1 m.) had been neglected. The
relationship between Cwo and E shown in Figs. 3b to 7b still
holds except that the absolute value of Cwo is some w
hat
increased.

- 12 decreases with increase of the parameter, while for one (#358 )
it clearly increases.

The law of similitude also applies to

this variation in

exceptir-g for profile #355.

Ca

The trail-

ing edge of the large model of this profile was very weak and
flexible so that there was a possibility both for incorrect
measurement of the angle of incidence and for deformation of
the profile under Wind pressure.

The angles of incidence are

less accurately held for the large models than for the medium
sized ones because the wires supporting the trailing edge are
longer and pass over several pulleys and hence stretch more under load, allowing the wing to turn under the force of the
wind, so that the angle of incidence during the test is not exactly the same as that to which it was adjusted in still air.
With the smallest models it is not always possible to prevent
a small change in angle because of the bending of thin trailing
edges.

While these errors mean little in themselves they

n~v­

ertheless largely explain the discrepancies between the curves
for the different sized models on the

Ca - E

charts.

The moment coefficients, depending as they do mostly on
the lift, are nearly independent of the parameter.
Finally, it will be noticed that there is a variation in
the values of the maximum lift coefficient obtained for various
va~ues

of the parameter.

This is shovm on the polar curves

and more particularly in Figures 30 - 7c.

The large models es-

pecially show an increasing maximum for high values of the parameter.

A comprehensive explanation can not yet be given for

this phenomenon, which is in practice of no importance.
