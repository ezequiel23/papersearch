CCMl?ETTION FOR SAFETY FUEL TANKS=
I
The Director of Research, Air Ministv,t,in aiming at se~ri~-~
the

design ‘of’ ‘a”th’o”rm.@hlyAfe and reliable fuel tank for service
s

and co~mercial purposes, is desirous of bringing to notice that it
is proposed to hold a cornpetit
ion on the lines %aid down and governed by the following rules and regulations:1. Prizes.
A prize of S1,400 will be awarde~ to the maker

of the tank,

which> in the opinion of the Judges, wl!ilefulfilling the requirements and possessing the attri’butesstat~d below, is best suited
for use in aeroplane= and seaplanes.
No guarantee is given that contracts for the successful t~e
Of tank will be placed, and should such orders be given they will

not necessarily be confined to the prize winner.
The entrant of the ta.nk,which in the opinion of the judges
merits second place, will be awarded a prize of S900.
The entrant of the tank, which in the opinion of the judges
merits third place, will be awarded a prize Of 2200.
2. Reauirmients to be fulfilled.
(a) The tank is to be cons~mc~ed
possible

so w

to Pr-ent

ss far ss

leakage ox ignition of fuel:

(i) When subjec%ed to stresses similar to those to which the
tank would be subjected in an aircraft crash;
(ii) Subjected to machine gun fire using incendiary, armourpiercing, Or explosive ammunition.

Equal importance is attached to the requirements involved i
(i)and

(ii)above.

..(.b.). tank is to be capable of being fitted within a space
The
of 2 ‘ft.6 in. by 2 ft. by 2 ft.

In-conforming to this mle

any

shape of tank will be accepted for co~etition.
(c) The capacity of the tank must be within 5 per cent. of
30 gals.
(d) All the necessary fittings to enable the tank to be
mounted in the structure shown in accompanying diagram must be
supplied by the competitor.
(e) 1.75 lb. complete with fittings as mentioned in paragraphs (d) and (f) per gallon capacity is regarded asthe maximum
weight which would only be justified”by very exceptional qualities.
Tanks exceeding this fi~ure will not be disqualified, but

3it should be borne in mind that great importance will be attached
to low weight.
(f)

In al

cas&

the t&k

is “to” e complete with the necesb

sary fittings to enable it to perform its functions of supplying
fuel to the point

‘lFmshown on the diagram.

In the case of tanks designed to incorporate leak detectors
and similar instruments =d devices, these latter will be fitted
in such a manner as to show their efficiency under test, and will
be inc~uded in the weight.

In every case there must be at least

one filler and also unions for supply snd delivery connections,
one of the latter at the top> the other at the bottom of the tank.
3. Other Characteristics.
The nain requirements to be fulfilled are as detailed in para@=ph 2 (a} (i) and (ii) “Requirements to he Fulfilled.”

The rel-

ative importance of other characteristics of the tanks will be con. .sidered in t’hefollowing ordeT:1.

Light weight.

Tests.

All tanks will b; ’s”fibmitted preliminary trials. The three
to
best types will be seiected by the Judges for the final trial.
Preliminary Tests.
For the preliminary tests at lesst two tanks of exactly similar design will be submitted by each competitor. Both of these
will be subjected %0 a crashing test of the following nature.
The tank will be mounted in a wooden structure conforming in
general to the design shown in the diagram, it being m~nted behind a coricreie

body formed to represent an engine. The tank mill

be released down a wire ropeway, approximately 100 ft. high, so
arranged that the structure
not

less

will strike the grfind at an angle of

than 45° from the horizontal and will be free to turn ovez.

This will ensure as far as possible the conditions prevailing in a
typical aircraft crash.
In both the a“oove-mentioried
tests the tanks will contain 22
gallons of petrol which sill be supplied by the Air Ministry.

Final Tests.

i;.:.id

These will be subjected to crashing and firing test,
---be identical.
the former as detailed above, and the:l-&tii as-follows:--””

The t@

will be subjetted to Machine gun fire with ammuniti.cm

capable of:(1) penetrating the ordinary type of mild steel fuel tsnk, and
leaving small entry and large exit holes when the tank is struck 3e-low fuel level.
(2) Exploding and igniting the

fuel either on centact or aftez

penetration.
A series of bursts of five rounds each will be fired a.ta
range of 5G yards, the tank being exsmined after each burst.
The angle of fire will be at the discretion of the Judges.
At any time during the competition the Judges may impose such
other tests (e.
g., t o determine the resistante to acceleration,
etc.) ss the-ymay desire in order to demonstrate the relative merits of competing tanks.
Tlnerewill be an interval of at least eight weeks between the
preliminary snd final tests.
Re~ulations.
(1) The competition will begin on December 1, 1921, and will
be held at a place hereafter to be notified to intending competitors.
(2) Each tank entered will be supplied at the cost of the compel~itor,and is to be packed in a strong case or crate suitable for
distant transport by rail, and delivered carriage paid to the:,
