Following an historical review,of aneroid development, in
which the work of Chree is emphasized, the authors state:
.

“It would therefore seem well worth wb.ileto undertake

through some suitable im--rovenentof ths aneroid, to diminish tke
width of the hysteresis loop sufficiently to make the
suiting frcm it practi~lly

negli~ble. “

To discover the origin of the

authors proceed to e~a~o~a~a ~h~’~ey~s of

this

equation by zefer-

ence to the theory of eia=ticity.
Two cases are considered, - first, that of a thin, flat diaptragm undergoing a deflection which is quite small compared to
its thickness; second, the opposite extreme case nhen ‘thedeflection of the diaphragm is quite large compared to its thiclmess.
The first special case enables us to consider that only shearing stresses normal to the diaphfagm exist, radial tensions being
neglected.

The other extreme case makes just the opposite assump-

tion, namely, that the Gnly stresses whit-nneed

to-

be considered

are tensions parallel to the surface of the diaphra~.

After cac-

rying through the theory of both cases ae far as ~ossible, the au.
thors abandon the equations so deticed in favor of e~lPiricalobservations. ~everth~less, some tenta*ive coficlusions
are reached
which are interesting.

From equation (3) it is evident that the influence of elasiic
after-effect on the indication of an aneroid in the co~templated
case diminishes with diminishing thickness of the diaphragm, and
with increasing spring constant f,

this last insofar as the after-

effect of the diap-hra~ is greater than that of the spring.
