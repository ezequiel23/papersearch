EW!3ODUUC1ON.
The purpose of the im-esti@ions
on the performance of air propellers described in the
following report -was the e.xt.ension in certain directions of the field covered by the previous
instigations
(Reports ATOS.14, 30, 64) and the kst&u of certain special forms.
The forms included under the present report are characterized as follows:

d
feet.
~PIanerivingface 17”-10

~ Plane dri-iingfact 21’40 feet.

It wi.U be noted that propellers 139, 144, 145, 146 are similm in dl respects to hTos. 3,4,

the combination of these k-o blade forms and blade
areas. These results, together with those pretiousl~ tested, thus give a series of values in
each of the four families for the SLYnomimd pitch ratios, 0.3, 0.5, O.T, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3.

outline.
14. Propeller 150 is of form No. 1 (Report ATO.14), or with nearly straight parallel sides, and
has ako a mea-n ~dth of 0.25r. These two propellers serve, with the two mean -widths preciously reported orL, to give two series of vaIues for vtim
blade area correspomling to mean
widths, resipectivel~, of O.15r, 0.20r, 0.25r.
Propellers 151, 152 are of form and area the same as F, A, of Report h’o. 14, but with
fzce Hat or umvarpeii.
For propelIer 151, the blade is set at such an ang~e as to give, at the
13-inch radius, a pitch of 25.2 inches, or the same as a O.T pitch ratio propeller of 36 inches
LIia.meter. For propelIer 152 the blade is sek to give simiiarly, at the 13-inch radius, a pitch
of 32.4 inches, or the same as a 0.9 pitch ratio propeller of 36 inches diameter.
PropeIIers 142 and 123 have a section and pitch identical -with propeller No. 1 of Report
No. 14. They have contoum, however, as shown on plates 1, 11, the sections being distributed
aio~~ a c~cloidal curve instead of a radial IineJ as in the case of No. 1. These forms were
inte~ded to test certain ideas submitted to the committee by Brig. Gen. H. H. C. Durrwoody
(retired).

TESTS.

The various results are given in the form of curves of the thrust and torque coefficients
T tind Q and efficiency p.
The thrust and torque coeflkients are defined by the equations

(2)

(3)
The introduction
of the factor g serves to render the coefficients nondimensional
and
thus indepenchmt of the system of units employed, provided they are homogeneous.
The values of Tc, Qc, and p thus defined are given on curve sheet diagrams Nos. III tu

DISCUSSION OF RE~ULTS.

AS WOUM be expected, the efficiencies given by the propellers of 0.3 pitch ratio are so dieplaced relative to the vaIues of lT/ND that for low values of this abscissa the sfliciency is
higher and for high values lower, as compared with the efficiencies with forms of higher pitch
ratio.
The maximum efficiency reached, however, is definite~y less than those for higher pitch
ratios, thus f alIing in general line with the results for the series of pitch ratios 0.5, 0.7, 0.9,
1.1, 1.3.
The wide blade forms 148 and 150 have efficiency curves failing somewha~ below those
with Iesser area but with similar forms otherwise, thus indicating the increasing influence due
to skin resistance.
These efficiency curves have, however, a somewhat lengthened range, corresponding to the increased vake of the dynamic pitch.
Forms 151 and 152 show efficiencies definitely below those for the most nearly related
helicoidaI forms.
Over the workiug range, however, the differences are relatively small and
the tests indicate the close degree of approach to heIicoidal forms rezdized by these nonwarpcd
blades,
I?ropcllers 142 and 143 show efficiency torque and thrust curves very similar to those
for propeller No. 1, Propeller No. 142 having a convex leading edge, bends uncler Ioad in such

mum efficiency tham for No. 1, but somewhat higher effkiencies for large values of the slip
(low values of V/ND).
On the other hand, propeIIer No. 143 with concave Ieading edge increases in pitch when
under load with the corresponding result of showing a somewhat higher maximum efficiency
as compared with No. 1, but definitely Iower efficiencies over the working range of moderate
to small values of V/ND.
