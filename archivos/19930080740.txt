EXTRACTS FROM THE G13UMAN
TECHNICAL PRES&
TRANSPORT AIRPLAilES:13y

A. X. Rohrbaciz.
——.
The tzaasition stage of aixplanes and.aerial transyort 02gaaizations, now known under the genem.1 title of transpoxt aix~ianes
and aerial transport> will be of short duration; afidetheshorter
the better, for we are now on the brink of a newj?h=se of development. Few people are snare of tinefizsi step made towards it,
still,fewer have aay idea of the asymptote.

It will be by work

and experience alone that light can be thrown on the path of progress o.~ened by the spirit of ei~te~prise
up
and science.
This being the case, and in th~.~hopethat the following lines
.
..
may be regarded rather as a challe~e to further thought and to
interchange of ~ptnion than as a prophecy, I gladly accede to the
request

made by tineeditors of the “Luftweg” and pxompted by an

azticle by 13r,ESSICH, of Breslau, - appearing in Nos. 24/25 of
that magazine - in contributing my opinion on the subject o.f
)’Transport
Airplanes’ from the constructor’s viewpoint,

-

It is cettain that p~oblernswill arise not only concerning
aizplanes of large dimensions> but for all intermediate sizes
dovn to the very smallest. Aridthese different sizes of airplanes
will be utilized for different pu:poses.
TIM prospect of designing aivplanes of large dimensions may
be most attractive to manufacturers, but they would promote de-

airplane. Greater or less technical perfection has far more infl’ueilce tinetransit value of airplanes than the actual size of

the machines, l~hichis of comparatively slight importmce.
Great caution is needed in applying the zesults of =rtime
construction to present conditions? because the demands that azose
in wartime were almost entirely diciated “Dythe requirements of
the mcment and forced conditions. We have, for instance, pneumatic tires of as much as 1750 by 300 mm. with a 1ifting power of

4000 kg. Airplanes cf total tieght amountLng to 8CO0 kg. might

therefore be constructed on o~dinazy tWO-~tieeled

and the total weight might even be 32000 kg. if the landing-gear
had four double wheels like those made at Staaken during the Rar.
As a matter of fact, wing construction, fuselage and landing-gear
are so dependent on one another that littie can be said.

-3those of ‘~henew 1000 HP monoplane bu.
ili at the Ze~pelin lTorks,
Staaken, have many aavaiitages,@NXI zightly co~structed, over
othex types of construction. As for the fuselage, there can be
no doubt but that the uethod of construction with consolidated
outer surface alone presents possibilities fox the futmre. It on?
ly remains to be seen how soon sheet lead will take the Place of
_. —corrugated lead.

For the fundamental pa~t’sof engines, thexe are
o
so many considerations of manufactu~e and accessibility to be oonsidexed that it is difficult to know whether the flying-boat r:etb-

od should be adopted, - with cons~>idated surface -.or cellular
partition work with a covering.

The powe~ installation should always be designed and construtted with due reference to the fundamental principles laid
dovm for airship engine construction, It is in any case risky to
have a single propeller driven ky several engines. The ambitious
desire to overcome all the difficulties of vibration and osciiZatioa, noa-xesistant fundamental parts and traoes of ;i’ea%
leads to
no ma%erial advantage that might not be otherwise ohtaineci,
in
the case of transport airpianes, anldwitlnfar less risk.

If sev-

eral small propellers are accurately installed and constructed,
the efficiency obtaimd will he at least equal to that obtained
with a single large propeller.
The question of the accessibility Of engines during flight
can be satisfactorily coped with for large.airplanes as mall as
small ones.
riwher

It may be managed eithex by connecting each one of a

of engines centrally ins~alled in the fuselage with its

is of cGurse ‘moreeasily obtained with consolidated outer surfaces
thafiwith cellular wing bracing.
.
The decisioa in favor of or again@

centralized or decerr6zal-

ized installation is cliffcult, and i% depends to a great extent
i
or~other oondi~ions. Botilshould be furt~ez developed. The construction of transmission geaz and its seiting has not even ye%
been satisfactorily solved, but there are no ftuidamen%al
difficulties in the way. He na:~tal~ei* as a general principle that
if theze need be several engines; they must be quits independent
unitsj thus only is i% possible that ‘,Thenne engine breaks down~
o
the others ,cont

and act as a reserve.

If, on the other

hand, a breakdown occurs in the collective gear - where there is
always least mo~king safety - of an aixplane with a single propel.Zer a~ldseveral engii~es,
the sole resource is gli&ia~ fligh-t.
And this same gear is scarcely 2.ikely become safer as time goes
to
on, as even improved construction can only mend mat%exs slovly.
Even if sach gear were 100 tines as safe ia working as at pzesent:
a 4-e-ngine
airplane would still “Deless safe in ~orkir.g
than one
with four entirely independent power units.

For passenger transport, the decen-tralized
installationis
best adapted o.naccount of the fact that the engine-room is well
