RESUME”
The importance of securing the best possible fuel for aircraft enghw led ta the testing of a
number of fuels in the altitude laboratory of tha Bureau of Standards. The tests were made
with the carburetor adjusted by hand to give maximum power with mhimum fuel consumption
for this power, the engine operating with full throttle at various speeds and under conditions
corresponding to various altitudes.
It has been customary to judge the “usability” of a gasoline ite volatility. ‘l%: meaning
by
of usability of a gaaoline has often been, perhaps wrongly, expanded to include the power
performance of the engine. Combining the ideas, the distdlation curve of a gasoline has been
accepted by many as a true critmicm of the power to be obtained when using a fueI in an engine.
The resuhs of the teste made at the Bureau of Standards indicate that the distillation
curve of a gasoline gives no indication of the power that can be obtained from an engine using
this fuel, when the carbureting conditions are sukd to the fuel, and that it is not impracticable
ta attain these conditions.
These tests were made to determine the gasoline or gasolines gh-ing maximum power.
AnaI@s of the data was made in an audeawr to fmd the properties controlling the powerproducing ability of a gasoline. The question of economy is not considered in this report,
being deferred for a subsequent investigation. The tests proved that any of the gasoIinea used
can be made, by proper ‘ ‘carbureting,” to give the same power within a range of the order
of 5 per cent. It is probabIe that the relative nmrite of fuels for commercial and perhaps some
war uses will depend upon economy more than upon power ability.
Specification No. 3512 of the Bureau of Aircraft Production for aviation gasoline (export)
gives a satisfactory fueL More rigid specific&ms apparently do not give appreciably better
power performance in an engine.
DESCRIPTION

OF APPARATUS AND 0BJEC7P OF TBSTS AND STUDIES.

The following report is based on tests made in the altitude laboratory of the Bureau of
Standards. The eugine was a ‘&pe A Hispand3uiaaj made by the Wrigh&Martin Aircraft
Corporation, New Brunswick, N. J., fitted with pistons giving a compression ratio of 5.3 and
developing 180 h. p. at 1,800 r. p. m. The eight cyIinders are 120 mm. by 130 mm. (4.725 by
6.118 inches) and are arranged in two bIocks of four, set at, an angIe of 900. The intake manifold was the regular design, with wa~jacketed
tee. The carburetor was a CIaudel duplex,
manufactured in Frame, with a valve between the float chamber and the jets to control the
amount of fuel supplied. The akitude chamber has thermally imulated walk. The sir may
be partially ~austed from the chamber by meamsof a blower, reducing the barometric preeaure
to that corr~ponding ta any altitude up to 30,000 feet. As the air enters the chamber it is
passed over a series of refrigerating coils which serve to regulate the temperature during the
trots. The engine is coupIed to an eIectric dynamometer placed outside the chambar by
means of which the power of the engine may be absorbed and measured. Cumplete description
of this apparatus and the methods of observation may be found in Report No. 44.

The purpose of these engine tits was to determine the dative power-producing dues
of several different kinds of gasoline. Analyses of the data obtained have been made to correIate the results of these tests with some of the physical and chemieal properties of the gasdinea.
The reds
of these studies show that the properties considered are not the ones which exert
the major control of the power-producing qualities of a gasoline. The physical propertb
which were considered were the distillation curva, the heating vahmszthe densities, the ma=gnetooptical rotations, and the critical solution temperatures with aniline. The ehemictd propertied
were much 1S carefully studied, because of the considerable time required for chemical analyees.

SPECIFICATION FOR AVIATION GASOLINES.

Following is a brief summary of the speoitications for the various gasolines as issued by
the Bureau of Aircraft Production 1918, for seversl types of aviation gasolines:
Aviation gasoline (dommtic), Specifkation No. 3511–B.
Aviation gasoline (export), Specification No. 3512.
Aviation gssoIine (&hting), Specification No. 3513.
In these specifications certain requirements were given to insure freedom from acid and
other impurities, these requirements being identical for each grade. In the requirements
for volatility and distillation range, the specifications vary in the temperature limite for the
vmious fractions. The foUowing table gives .&e temperature requirements in degrees centigrade as the various percentages of the sample have been recovered in the graduated reeeiver:

It wiJl be noted that the higher Mmperatire at the 5 per cent point in the specifications
for export gasoline is lower than for fighting gasoline. With this reception a gasoline that
will meet the specification for fighting gasoline w-N meet the specification for either of the
others. It wiU also be noted that a gasoline distilling throughout the entire range at temperatures over 50° C. and under those spe~ed would fill the speticationa for domestic and
export, and one in which all fractions distdled at any temperature over 60° C. and under those
speoifled would comply with the specification for fighting gasoline. In other words, the specifications do not provide for a lower limit of temperature except for the tit 5 per cent. Attention is called to these points ta show the wide range of gssolines which may be provided and

DESCRIPTION

OF GASOLINES USED.

Ten gasolines form the subject of this report, nine being compared in turn with a standard
gasoline as a reference fuel. Before describing these fuels in detail, a brief description of their
general charactaristice will be given. Two of the fuels~one of them the reference standard, were
representative American straight run gasolines from an eastern refinery and complying closely
with the specScations for cqort gasoline. A third followed olosely the speoitkations for
fighting gssoIine, while two others were slight variations of the fighting gasoIine. These
gasolines, representing the Frenoh aviation gasolines, were imported from Fnmoe, and followed
closely the requirements given above for export and fighting gasolines, reapecthly.
Two
gasdinee representing the average motor cm gasoline as sold at automobile filling stations
were run se a matter of comparison. One of these was of eastern origin, and the other a CaEfornia gs901ine. Referenoe to the distillation curves (plot 1) will show that these fuels were
quite outside the area covered by the distillation curves of the atiation gasolines. The rmmbem employed to designate the various fueIs which were tested in the progress of this inveati1670S0--S. Doe.S07, 6~6

They have no other significance, excapt in
and in making all the analysea of these sampk.
the case of “X” which is the designation employed by the Bureau of Standards for the reference standard, it being the refinery abbreviation for “Export.”
A detailed description of the
Vlxriousfuels follows:
Standard X gasoline was manufactured by the Atlantic Relining& as one of their standard products. Two lots of this fuel were employed in these teats, because the supply of tho
first became exhausted before the series was completid. The fit, des~atid
ss “o]d X,”
oomplies with the spetications for domestic gasoline, and was employed as a reference fuel
when testing gasolines 263, 264, 265, and 266, The second, designated as Now X, complies
with the specification for export gasoline and was employed as a reference fuel for the remainder
of the gasolines, namely 186, 191, 261, 262, id mmniercial. The distillation curves of time
two reference fuels are quite different, although their mean volatilitias are practically the
same and their power charactaristice were similar. The unavoidable use of two standards
necessitated an indirect method of comparison, which ia more fully discussed later.
In May, 1918, the Bureau of Mines requested the Atlantic Ref3.ningCo,, of I%iladelphia,
to furnish sundry grades of gasoline for examination and teat. These were to be Used for
guidance in drawing spec~catioW for the ~ghtjng grade. In compliance with this request.
the Athmtio Reiining Co. submitted four sampka of 100 gallons each as follows:
Gasoline No, 264 was designed to reprwent-as cIosely as possible a gasoline complying with
the then existing specifications adopted by the I?etroleum War Sertice Committae in accordance
with the report on aviation gasoline. These specifications were: 5 per cent above 50° C!., 8 per
cent below 70° C., 50 per cent below 90° C. and not over 3 per cent of the residue to remain in
the flask at 150° C. The actual distillation curve for 264 is given tith the curves for all the
others on plot 1.
Gasoline No, 265 was prepared to comply with the requirements of the then existing
specXcations for the fighting grade, which were the same as those of specifications No. 3513,
excepting that the first 5 per cent must pass below 70° C. instead of 75° C.
Gasoline No, 263 has about the same average boilingj point as No. 265, excapt that it is
obtained from the stallwithin a very narrow tamperatwe range. It is what is ter.mcd a 700 C.900 C. cut. It complies with the requirements of SpecMcation No. 3513 of the Bureau of Aircraf t
Production, 1918.
Gasoline No. 266 is of the same general quality as the @hting grade, except that it contains
a considerably larger proportion of material distilling at low temperatures. This fuel compIies
with the specifications for the fighting grade except that .-tie distillation temperature when tho
first 5 per cent has been recovered is 54.5° C. instead of being aboye 60° C., as required. Quoting
from a Iettur from the Atlantic Refining Co. under date of May 23, 1918, this gasol.im was prepared “for the purpose of ascertaining by examination whether the specification, with respect
ti light ends, has been drawn too rigidly. It is our fear that, by making the spocificatione too
rigid in this direction, it has resulted in decreasing rather than increasing the efhiency of the
gasoline.”
GasoIines Nos. 261 and 262 were imported from France and woro received at the Bureau of
Standards May 21, 1918. .Gasolino No, 261 was marked “Essence Sumatra,” denoting that it
was derived from Sumatra crudes. This is a gasoline considerably used for aviation purposes
in France, It is described quite fully in Part II of this reporj “l?owei Characteristics of Sumatra
and Borneo Gasolines.”
Gasoline 262 was received in containers marked “Essence kgere de Borneo,” It is n
close-cut gasoline, approximately a 70° C.-90° cut, and in this feature similar to No. 263.
Gasoline No. 185 is a fuel with a“very narrow distillation range, a 60° C.-70° C, cut, and
close end points. The origimd distillation, from which the curve in plot 1 was drawn, shows
that tho distillation temperature lies between 60° C., and 70° C. for 80 per cent of the sample.
A check distillation made from a sample taken from the barrel several months later shows over

FOE AH&OIMFT ENGDKES.

90 per cent of the sample lying between these two temperatures, with the first 5 per cent going
over at 61° C. and 95 per cent at 70° C. The check distillation brings the gasoline within the
requirements of the specification for the fighting grade, but considerably below the required
temperatures at 50, 90, and 96 per cent. Gasoline No. 185 is, therefore, cIose to the lower
limit of distillation temperatures that will comp~y with the requirernenta of Sp*cation
No.
3513 for aviation gasoline (@hting). This is not an inference that a closer cut can not be made,
but that No. 185 well represents the lower extreme of the specification just as No. 261 represents the higher Emit.
Gasoline No. 191-A was shipped to the Bureau of Standards by the Associated OiI Co.
from Avon, CaIif. The sample used in the test corresponds very cIoseIy in its distillation curve
with commercial ga901ine.
CmnmercirdgasoIine is a fair sample of the fuel usuaLIysold at gasobne i311ing
stations and
is of a lower grade (higher boiIing point) than X. It was purchased under the United States
General Supply C-ommittee’s specifications for 1918-19, as foLIows: Twenty per cent must not
distill under 50° C.; 20 per cent must distill under 105° C.; 60 per cant must distill under 140° C.;
90 per cent must distiU under 177° C.; “dry point” not above 210° C.

CRITIOAL SOLUTION TEMPEEATUEE.

The critioal temperatures of solution with aniline were determined at the Bureau of

liquid layers can appear. A sudden clouding of the homogeneous liquid takes place upon cooIing
through this critical tanperature. The subject is one treated in standard works on physica3

MAGNETO+~IO

.

ROTATORY

POWER.

In determining the properties of various organic mixtures, it has been found that the
presence of oonsiderable proportions of compounds of the benzene group has a tandency to
increase the rotation of the plane of polarization, when a beam of mono-chromatic light is
passed through the substance, in a strong magnetic field. The presence of the benzene group
hae been thought, by some, to be associated with increased engine power. Thus it was a
o-onceivable hypothesis that the magnetic rotation might prove a convenient indicator of the
power-producing ability of the fuel. This hypothesis seemed worth testing, in view of the
fact that the apparatus for measuring magnetic rotation was in operation at the Bureau of
Standards and this property of the gasolims could be measured in a few moments. Also,
the method has value as an aid to chemical analysis. & forecast of an analysis, wherever
equipment is available, it may save much time by indicating what substances to look for and
what not to expect. No definite connection between this physicaI property and the engine
performance of a gasoline w= proved.
The apparatus employed was a magnetic polarimeter having a maximum field intansity
of 50,000 lima per square centimeter, and capable of being read to one thousandth of a degree
of circular arc. The samples b be tested are placed in tubes 20 om. long. Through them is
projeoted a polarized ray of monochromatic light of great intensity selected from the spectrum
of the light from a quartz mercury vacuum tube of special construction. By means of a narrow
mirror the green (546.lwd is seleci%dfrom the spectrum of the tube, and projected through the
polarimetar. From the rotation, the measured strength of the magnetic field, and the kngth
of the sample, are obtained the vahms tabulated.
For the purpose of comparison, the various properties of the principal hydrocarbons
commonly found in gasolines are given in Table II.
OHEMIOAL COMPOS~ION.

An effort was made to determine, approximately, the general ohemical character of the
gmolines twted. The chemical determination of the constituents Qf a gasoline is a long and
tedious process, aud the amount of work involved prevented such procedure at this time, However, an approximate idea of the nature of the fuel maybe had from Lhecharacteristic that have
bem determined.
Gasoline No. 185 agrees quitwgenerally in its general properties with hexane. The specific
gravity is but 2 per cent higher, the mean volatility is just below the boiling point, the critical
solution texaperature with aniline slightly higher, the heat of combustion is practically the same,
and the magnetic rotation slightly below that of hexane.
No. 191-A and commercial gasoline are not within the range of aviation gasolines.
Gasoline No. 262 has a low critical solution temperature, possibly indicating napthones.
The mean volatility is the same se the boiling point of natural cyclohexane. The magnetic
rotation of this fuel is much higher than that of hexeme, probably due to the benzonm and tho
higher members of the naphthene series.

GaeoIine No. 263 can be judged chiefly by ifa low rotatory power, which is slightly greater
thsn that of pentane. Being an American gsdine, a huge proportion of napthenes wouId not
be expected. Benzenes might raise the rotation. It would appear, perhaps, to be a mixture
rioh in pentane.
Gasoline No. 264 may be judged &et from its magnetic rotation and second from its criticsl
solution temperature, both of which approach those of hexane. Its mean volatility and speoific
gravity would indicate an admixture of a considerable proportion of heptane and a small amount
of octane. If pent.sne ie present, it perhaps forms an exceedingly small percentage of the whole.
Gasoline No. 265, if judged solely from its physical characteristic, would appear to be of
much the same oonatitution as No. 264. It has a slightly lower rotation, and lower mean
volatiht y than No. 264, but the criticsl solution temperature is higher. Examination of the
distillation curve, however, shows that it h a much ~mg~ proportion of ~o~er bo@
Po~t
constituents, aud approaches in this respect very cIoeely to No. 266. On account of its low
power characteristics, the physical ohsracteristics of this fuel should be psrtiouhdy noted.
GssoIine No. 266 would appear from its low magnetic rotation to be particularly rich in
pentane. This is confirmed in a measure by its comparatively low mea+ boiling and the general
character of the distillation curve.
METHODSOF TE3TING.
The engine was operated in reduced pressures, corresponding to_fg_qr _differe@ altitudes
varying slightly in the difterent tests but averaging approximately as follome:
5,350 feet (62.5 cm. I&.)
,
11,000 feet (50.8 cm. ~.)
19,000 feet (38.0 om. Eg.)
25,500 feet (25.8 cm. ~.)
and at five diffwent speeds at each altitude: 1,300, 1,500, 1,700, 1,900 and 2,100 r. p“.m. The
carburetor was adjusted by hand for each tE& to secure the mxcimum horsepower for that
particular speed, altitude, and fuel, with the lesnest possible mixture for -*urn

maximum possible brake pull regardkss of fuel consumption. The fuel supply was then
diminished until the brake puIl was reduced, Then the gasoline flow was incrmsed gradually
until the brake pull reached the maximum obtained in the preliminary trial,
In these tests the engine was run at the various speeds at one barometric pressure and,
immediately before or after, corresponding runs were made with the comparison fuel, the
Standard X. This imwres that the engine is in practically tlmsame condition when run with the
fuel under observation as when run on the comparison fuel. This method permits the comparison of one fuel with anotharj by comparing the ratio of the performance of each with the performance of the standard.
METHODS

OF HANDLING THE TEST DATA.

These teeta were alI made at nearly the same air temperatures. In order to correct for
slight differences in the pmformance of the engine with the various fuels, the horsepowers
were reduced to n standard or to a mean temperature, The standard temperate used in
these tests is 0° (2. (plots 2 tJ-8, inclusive). The formula used for the temperature correction
to 0° C. iE that given in Report No. 45, Part III, Wmiation of Horsepower with Tempcuature.
After the horsepowera were corrected for temperature, they were plotted againstipeod,
plots 2 to 8, inclusive.
There are three major variables entering into these teats, namely, speed, power, and air
density. The relations between these three must form a smooth surface, when plotted in
three dimensions. ‘iThen a two dimensional section is employed, such as the reIation between
power and speed for a constant altitude, such a curve must not be fairod without some regard
to the relations between another two of the variables. In this way each observation in the
entire set, regardhss of the speed or density at which taken, becumes a check on s.Uthe other
observations.
From the scattering of the points on plots 2 k 8, it is apparent that different investigators
would necessarily disagree slightly as to the location of the faired curves. By selmting the
horsepowers corresponding to different altitudw for a given speed, other series of graphs were
prepared, in which the relation of power to barometric pressure is found to be nearly a straight
line. Oue investigator favored faired curves which were strictly linear. The values resulting
from this ~atter assumption lead to the percentage power differences shown in Table III, and
on plots f) to 12. The percentage differenc~ are computed from the performance of “X”
gasoline aa a reference standard.

Since the ho~power observations for both the Old and New “X” vary somewhat with
the condition of the engine, it was necessary to select a representative X curve. For this purpose two curves were chosen, one from the test comparing 265 to Old ~ and one from the comparison of commercial ta New X. The reason for choosing these particular t&a as the bwt
tie between the old and new standard fuels is that each wss cunducted after a thorough cleaning
and overhaul of the engine, when the conditions were most favorable ta identity of engine
perfommnce in the two cams. The power curves for the two X gasolines were practically
identicsl. It is unfortunate that conditions rendered impossible a direct comparison of the
two fueIs, eliminating all assumptions as b constancy of engine performance.

CONCLUSION.

The maggtude of the ch~me in power developed by the engine when using these dMerent
gasolines must be considered very cerefully. The data from the tests have been worked up in
many ditl?erentways by several individuals. When the data ha~e been digested as in securing
Tables III, IV, and plots 9 to 12, the maximum increase of engine power, referred to X gssoline
as a standard, is 2.5 per cent at a normal speed of 1,700 r. p. m., and the greatest 10SSat this
speed is 2 per cent. At the excessive speed of 2,100 r. p. m., where the eflects of uncertain
engine performmce are greater, the greatwt chmgee of power ehowu me 3.6 per cent above and
below the X vshw.
The power values from the various fuels agree, therefore, within about
3 per cent plus or minus. h ordinary engineering work this is a permissible variation.
Every known precaution was taken in the testing to insure accuracy, so it may be that the data
are subject to wh error than 3 per cent. If the test data and subsequent methods of handIing
give redts of au accuracy better than 3 per cent, then the r=ults may be of a positive nature.
If greater errors are inherent, then the results are of a negative nature, failing to prove any
appreciable difference in these gasolinm when carburet@ conditiom me adapted to the fueI
used.
By using the data in the manner which Ied to Table III (ploi% 9 to 12), exact numerical
values may be essigned to the power differences. Omitting considerations as to -whether the
accuracy of these numbers warrants any aufi r~m
of the fuels, it maybe of interest to tabulate them in the order of power producing ability as indicated by these numbers. The redt is
Table IV, which is reproduced h demonstrate that there is very fittie or no detite connection
between the power ability and the properties considered.

It is evident that the best and some of the average gasolines had similar properties, and
some of the average fuels had properties similar to the poorest. No way was found of predicting the power perforrmmce from any one, or fim any group of properties. Admitting
appmpriata probable errors in TabIe III, the only unqualified gmeral deduction warranted is
equally evident fron the or&inal laboratory curves of power vw speed, plots 2 to 8.
The deflnita general conck+ion fkom this work is that when the necessary carburetion
Chang= have been made so that “each fueI wss prepared as well as possible for combustion in
the engine, then one particular g=oline was slightly superior in power producing qualities, a
krge number of others were nearly as good, and two were slightly but distinctly inferior to tie
others, the extreme diffenmces being of the order of magnitude of 5 per cent.

PART IL

POWER CHARACTERISTICS OF SUMATRA AND BORNEO GASOLINES.’
By E.

W. ROBESiS.

R&XJM&

The importance of securing the best possible airylane engine fuds has led to a series of
experiments on a number of fuels in the altitude laboratory of the Bureau of Standards and at
various flying fields. Two gasolines extensively used for aeronautical work by the Frenoh and
therefore of particular interest are those distilled from crudes found in the Islands of Sumatra
and Borneo. Experiments on gaso%es from those crudea are of additional interest l.xwauseof
the very exhaustive rasearch that has been made by L. J. Simon to determine their chemical
constituents. These investigations by Simon were ca.mkd on in Paris, and are the subject of
an extensive cofidautial report.
Fkom the rwults of the experbenta oonductad at the Bureau of Standards with a sample
of each of these fuels, having wiatility ranges of from 50° C. to 130° C. for Sumatra, and from
50° C. to 100° C. for Borneo, the following conclusions have been drawn:
(1) The sample of Sumatra gaeoline tested develops slightiy more horsepower (maximum
L4 per cent) than the United States standard” (exp&t) aviation gasoline (Aircraft Production
Specification No. 3512) at the altitudes and the engine speeds covered by the experiments.
(2) The sample of Borneo gasoline tested develops slightly ks horsepower (maximum 0.6
per cent) than United States “sttidard (eiport) aiiation gasoline, throughout the range of
speeds and altitudes covered by the experiments.
(3) Both samplM of Sumatra and of Borneo gasolims dtmdop higher horsepowers than
cmnmereid gasoline. The maximum increase for Sumatra gasoIine is 4.2 per cent and that
for Borneo gasoline is 2.2 per cent.
(4) An investigation of &e heata of combustion of Borneo and Sumatra gaaoIines shows
these values to be practically identical
(5) Fractional diatilIation shows-a lower volatility (temperature of .dietWation) for the
sample of Borneo gasoline than for the sample of Sumatra, although the lattm shows a higher
horsepower.
(6) The fuel eoonomy when using the sample of Sumatra gasoline was muoh higher than
when using the United States standard (export) aviation gasoline, except at the highest altitudes at which observations were made.
(7) The fuel eeonomy of the sample of Borneo gaaoEn&may be said to have averaged
about the same as the United Statea“stiiniisrd (export) aviation gasoline.
~RODUCI’ION.
The following report is based upon experiments made in the altitude laboratmy of the
Bureau of Standards. In this laboratory, the engine used ‘h the tests is installed in a eonoreta
chamber having insulatad walls, from which the air maybe partially exhausted by means of a
blower. This blower also handb the exhaust from the engine, thus reducing the barometric
pressure on the exhaust, the intake, and the surrounding spaca, to that corresponding to any
desired altitude, up to about 40,000 feet. Before the air entara the chamber it is passed over
a series of refrigerating coils, and by this means its tanperature maybe reduced during the ex1 ‘ma report WaaoonMentIalIy rdmuwd

vacuum chamber and auxilimy apparatus may be found in ‘I%&nical Report No. 44.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF FUEL9.

The fueLs,the characteristic of which me the subject of this report, are of special interest
because of their representative character. The gasoline distilled from the crudea found in the
Islands of Sumatra (Bureau of MimwNo. 261) is very probably similar in proportions of ita various
hydrocarbons to the average German airphme fueL That derived from Borneo crudea (Bureau
of Mines No. 262) is partictiarly high in naphtienes (cydica, hydromomatica).
The standard
fuel with which both gasoIines were compared during the exp eriments in the altitude laboratmy,
and referred to hereafter as X, fuMlla the epecifmations of the United States Bureau of Aircraft
Production for aviation gasoline (export), spedication No. 3512. This is a typical American
gasoIine, a product of crudes from the Atlantic or Eastern oil fialds.
Further interest is attached to the Sumatra and Borneo gasolines as they have been the
subjects of a most exhaustive investigation in France, to determine the proportions of the
various hydrocarbons of which they are comprised. These investigations were made at &le
Normale Superieur in Paris, under the mspicea of L. J. Simon.
Some ten or more homologous series of hydrocarbons have been found in petroleums.
Gasolines are generally comprised of varying proportions of the following four:
cnHzm+2= Methanes, also Called parffis, acyclica, aliphatic9.
C@,, – 6 + ES= Naphthenw, dso called hydro aromatka, Cyclimj polymethelenes.
CmH,.–6 -Ihnzenee or aromatim.
~n~. = Olefinea, also c.alkd ethyIenes, ethylenics.
The sequence in which the compounds are noted above is the order of predominance, and
the fimt of the names given are those most commonly used. The oleflnw me also lmown as
unsaturated compounds, and contain lwe hydrogen than the methane group. Benzenes md
naphthenes me of a more stable natme than the ol&nes. The naphthenea are frequently given
the same group formula as the ohm,
of which they are isomers, akhongh diihrent both in
their phfical and chemical characteristics. The propmtions of these sewmd groups in the
principal aviation gasolinea are given by Simon as follows:

It should be noted that Simon does not give the proportion of unsaturated compounds,
but includw them in the methmes. TIM percentage of methanes is determined by difference
after debrmhing benzenea and naphthenes. It is interesting to note that the composition
of Sumatra gasoline is an approximate average of the two Germm gasolines. It may be considered as probabIe that the performance of Sumatra is an indication of what might be ex’peded
of German airpIane fuels. The proportions given by Simon for American gasoline are not
obtained from standard X, but the f@res may be considered sa approximatdy the proportions of x.
The foIlowing information on Sumatra and Borneo fuds wss furnished by %ury P. Watt,
the author of several books on petroleum. Sumatra crudea contain about 12 per cent of natural
gasoline, while Borneo crudea contain about 8 per cent. The gasoline output is further increased

and in the Borruw gaedine by adding casing head gasoline.
The cracking system in use is that known as the TrumbuIl process. The casing head gasoline
is obtained by the absorption process. The final percentage of gasoline obtained is approximately as follows: Sumatra, 42 per cent; Borneo, 30 to 32 per cent.

per minute.
The carburetor was carefully adjusted by hand for each test to secure the maximum horsepower at that particular speed and @titude with the_leanest rn@ure.
~g md@d of adjusk
xnent employed was as follows: The carburetor was fist adjusted so that the engine de~eloped
the maximum power possible regardless of fuel consumption. The fuel was then cut down
until the power decreased. Then the gasoline flow was gradudly increased till the maximum
power was demiloped as before. There was no adjustment of carburetor air temperatures,
which varied between – 10 and –20” (.?.
In these experiments the engine was operated at the various speeds and at one barometric
pressure, while on the fuel being tested, and then immediately before and after, corresponding
runs were made on the standard X comparison fuel. This method of observation gives assurance that the engine is in practically the same condition during runs on both kinds of fuel.
It also. permits of comparison between one fuel and another by means of the ratios of performance of each fuel to the standard fuel.
The samples of Sumatra and Bornoo gasolines which are the subject of this report show
the same range of distillation temperatures m given by Simon for the French aviation gmolines from the same sources.
The standard fuel referred to as X is manufactured by the Atlantic Refining Co., as one
of their regular products, and as already noted, accords with specification No. 3512 of the
Bureau of Ai.maft Production.
As a matter of interest, the performance of ‘kmunercial gasolhm” has been tabulated
and plotted with the results obtained from the samples of Sumatra and Borneo and from X
gasoline. The vahms for commercial gasoline have bimn tabulated by percentage differences
between tha values obtained for this fuel and X in another test.
“Commercial gasoline “ is a fair sample of the fuel usually scaldat gasoline filling stations,
and distills at higher temperature than X.
It was purchased under the United States GeneraI
Supply Committde’s Specification for 1918.
In order that a fair comparison of the p@ormance of the engine, while using the various
fuels, could be made, the horsepowers in each case were reduced to 0° C, The method of making
this correction is described in Technical Report No. 45, Part I.

show that at dl altitudw except 11,000 feet the sample of Sumatra gasoEne showed a
greater horsepower thau X, while at the latter altitude it wss lower b
X. This is so uuusual
and has been so seldom found in tests with other fuds that the rwults were open to suspicion.
Therefore the data were carefully analyzed for the purpose of detwminhg the probable cause
of the discrepancy.
By plotting the horsepowers aggimt barometric pressure, plot 2, it is apparent that the
resuh were obtained at a higher altitude than that recorded. Shiftig all these pointe the
same distance to the right, or to the ordinate corresponding to 49 cm. Eg., they will be found
b lie very nearly on straight lime drawn through observed horsepowers at the highast and
lowed altitude of the test. The new positions are indicated by dots. 1%will be noted that
in the majority of cssw all horsepowers observed at one spmd lie on a straight line, or very
nearly so. The points shown on p~ot 2 are obtained from plot 1 by drawirg curv= as
closely as possible thro~~h the horsepowers plotted from the observations. The intersections
of the straight linEs of plot 2 with the ordinates representing the four altitudes at which
observations were talmn were p~otted in ‘plot 1, and any error in selecting the proper line was
at once apparent. It was in this way that the curves of plofi 1 were obtained.
One feature of the lines of horsepower plotted sgainst barometric pressure was particubmly
helpful in @ method of analysis. It was found that the intercepts of these IinEson the axis
of zero pramua were quite evenly spaced. For example, in the equation of the line

wherein

y =horsepower, and
z = barometric pressure in cm. ~.,

the values of ?i increased by evcm incrermzniw
for evm increments of spaed. The value of b is
a function of the friction horsepower at that particular speed. Siice the friction horsepower
is entirely independent of the fuel employed, the vahws of b should be the same for each speed
regardks of the fueL Roughly estimating the equations of the various lines from the highest
and the lowmt horsepowers in each case showad that the vaks of h were approximately the
same for all fueIs. Plotting these values of b against speed and drawing u av-qxge line through
these points gave the final values of b, which were employed for the lines of plot Z. It is from
these equations, and not from the intersections in plot 2, that the horsepower values in Table
III were obtained.
In the case of commercial gasoline the values are those taken from another test by first
fairing tie curvw of both X and commercial by the method just described, and than tmmferring to the present test sheets by the ratio commercial bears to X.
In plot 3 are plotted the horsepower d.if7erencesbetween X and the two fuels under
observation. In this figure it will be seen that the horsepowers given by the sample of Sumatia
show a practically constant gain over X for each speed throughout the entire range of altitude.
The horsepowers given by the sample of Borneo are k
than the X horsepowers by a tied
amount for each speed tlmoughout the range of the observations.
fi plot 4 are plotted the percentage horsepower differences between X and the two fuels
as compared h X. These curves show practicably the same percentage differences for all altitudes at one speed. In the case of Sumatra the maximum appeam at 1,900 revolutions per
minute, whiIe the percentage of Borneo below X is practically constant at 0.7 per cent for all
speeds and all altitudes.
P1ot 5 shows the horsepower difkmmces betwean the sample of Sumatia and that of
Borneo as compared to commercial
Sumatra gasoIine shows au advantage which increases
as the speed increases, but decre~es as the altitude increases. Borneo gasoIine shows the
same general rdation, but h a much smaller degree. At 1,700 and 1,900 revolutions per
minute the horsepower difference is 1- than 0.5 per cent. The only point at which there is
a marked dit7arencebetween Borneo and cmnmerciaf is at 2,100 revolutions per minute.

Plot 7 shows the distillation curves of
Sumatra, Borneo, X, and commercial. These
determinations were made by the United States
Bureau of Mines. !I%e method employed is
described in this bureau’s Technical Paper No.
166.
The fuel consumption results obtained in the
engine tests at the Bureau of Standards should
be interpreted in the light of tie fact that a tide
variation of fueI consumption is ptible
tithou~ affecting the horsepower output. The gasoline consumption per hour were fist plotted
against revolutions per minute and then against
barometric pressure. FroLu the Consumption
per hour derived from these curves were computed the consumption per horsepower hour
given in Table IV.
The data in Table IV are shown in plots 8 to
13. Plot 8 shows the gadine consumption per
horsepower hour for X and the samples of
Sumatra and Borneo gasolirm plotted against
speed. Plot 9 shows the same data plotted
against altitude.

ANNUAL

REPORT NATIONAL

ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The percentage differences between commercial and the fuels under observation are plotted
in plot 6. Aa in plot 4, the percen~~ea are practically the same at each speed regardless of
altitude. The greatest diffenmce occurs at 2,100 revolutions per minuti.
Relative fuel economies determined by computing the diilerences between fuel consumption per horsepower hour of the Sumatra and X and Borneo and X samplw are plotted as
pwcentagea of the fuel consumption of X in plots 10 to 13. When the fueI consumption is
~ower than that of X, the percentage is shown as positive, while when it is higher than X the
percentage ia shown as negative. Eence pointe above the zero line show a higher fuel economy
than X and pointa below the line indicate lower economy.
The caloriflc value of Borneo gasoline is estimated by Simon to be 1,o99 kilogram calories
per 100 grams, and that of Sumatra is estimated aa 1,130 kilogram calorios per 100 grams
Careful determinations at the Bureau of Standards of the heate of combustion of sampks of
the fuels tested in the engine were made in a Junkera calorimeter, and every precautio~ taken
to guard against possible errors. In the caae of Borneo gszoline a large number of runs were
made to determine the probable error of observation. The variation from the mean of 12
observation (6 pairs) was less thm 0.4 par cent. Three determinations gave the following

The “low” values are those that determine the utility of the fuel in an internal combustion
engine, and the greateat difbrence in heating mduea of all four fuels is but 120 calories in an
average of 10,456 or 1.15 per cent.
CONCLUSIONS.
(1) The sample of Sumatra gasoline tinted develops slightly more horsepower (maximum
1.4 per cent) than the United States staxidard (export) aviation gasoline (Aircraft Production
Specification No. 3512) at the altitudes and engine speeds covered by the experiments.
(2) The sample of Borneo gasoline tasted develops alightiy 10Mhorsepower (maximum 0.6
per cent) than the United States standard (export) aviation gasoline throughout the range of
speeda and altitudes covered.
(3) Both mmplea of Sumatra and Borneo gasolines develop higher horsepower than the
commercial gasoline. The maximum increase for Sumatra gasoline is 4,2 per cent and that for
Borneo gasoline is 2.2 per cent.
(4) Au investigation of the heats of combustion shows th~e valuw ta be practically identical
for both gasolinee.
(5) Fractional distillatiomshowa a lower volatility (temperature of distillation) for the
sample of Borneo gasoline than for the sample of Sumatra, although the latter shows a higher
horsepower.
(6) Bearing in mind the facts in regard to fuel consumption mentioned above, the following conclusions can, nevertheleas, be drawn: The fuel economy when using the sample of
Sumatra is much higher than when using the United Statea standard (export) aviation gasoline,
except at the highest altitudes at which observations were made.
(7) The fuel economy of the sample of Borneo gasoline maybe said to average about the
same as the United States stsndard (export) aviation gasoline.

POTVYIR

CHARACTERISTICS OF 20 PER CENT BENZOL RIIXTURI?.’
By E. ~.

k)BEETS.

R&3UM&

The importance of securing the best possible airplane engine fucil led to tests of a number
of fuels in the altitude labomtoryat the Bureau of Stsndards and atvaricms flying fiekls. Among
the promising fuals was a mixture of benzol snd gasoline, 1,500 gaUons of which were therefore
prepared by the Gomrnmen t for distribution to the various laboratories for further tests.
The resulte of the qmrimenta in the altitude laboratory of the Bureau of Standards are given
in this report.
From the results of these tests the following conclusions have been drawn: Thie mixture
shows very Iittle gain in power as compared with aviation gasoline (~ort)
at the lower akitudw and the lower speeds. There is very little gain in horsepower below 10,000 feet. Above
this altitude, and at high augine speeds, the engine shows considemble gain in power, which at
29,300 feet end 2,100 revolutions per minute is 5.8 per cent.
While the methods of measuring fuel consumption were not entirdy satisfactory, the fueI
consumption of 20 per cent benzol mixture appems to be about 4 per cent greater than X, at
speeds and powers where it gives its best performance.
POWER CHARA(XER19TIOS OF 26 PER CENT BENZOKI BfIXTUIUL

The following report is based upon tests made in the altitude laboratory of the Bureau of
St.mdards. In this laboratory the engine under testis fitdled in a concrete chamber having
insulated walls from which the air may be partially exhauskd by mesna of a blowar, thus
reducing the barometric pressure within the chamber to that corresponding with any desired
altitude, up to about 40,000 feet. As it enters the chamber the air is passed over a series of
refrigerating cds, and by this means the temperature maybe regukted during the tads. The
engine is coupled directly to an electric dynamometer phiced outside the chamber, and by
which the power of the engine maybe absorbed and aud measured. A complete d=ctiption of
this apparatus and the methods of observation maybe found in Technical Report No. 44.
The fuel herein ctdkd “Signal Corps Mixture” @erea-fter referred to as S. C. M.) is a special
blend of gasoIine and bauzol made, up in accordance to specifications prepared by W.E. Perdew,
assistant chemicaI engineer of the Bureau of Mines, snd presented to the Science and Research
Division of the SiguaI Corps, United States Army, w follows:
Dxmription.-l%e blend shaU cudst of 20 per cant by volume of commercial” 90 per cent
benzol” and 80 per cent by volume of a special straight run gasoline. The blending or mixing
shaII be thorough, so that aU the individual containers will contain fuel of exactly the same
composition.

and at four different speeds at each ikitude: 1,5oo, 1,700, 1,900, and 2,100 revolutions, per
minute.
The carburetor was carefulIy adjusted by hand for each test, to secure the maximum horsepower at that psrticukw speed and altitude with the leanest mixture. The method of adjustment employed was as follows: Tho carburetor was first set to secure the maximum possible
brake pull regardless of fuel wmmunptiou. The fuel supply was then cut down until the
power felI off. Then the gasoline flow was graduaUy increased until the maximum brake pull
was again secured.
Iu these tests two sets of runs are made at the various speeds at each barometric pressure,one
on the fuel being tested, the other immediately before or after, with a comparison fueI, known
to th~ laboratory as standard X. This method of observation ensures that the engine is in
practically the same condition during the runs on each fuel.
The fuel designated herewith M standard X, and manufactured by the Atlantic Rdning Co.
ae one of their standard praducts, fultllk the specifications of the Bureau of Aircraft Production
for aviation gasoline (export] Speci13cationNo. 3512.
As a matter of interest the performance ofcomnmrcial gasoline haabeen tabulated and plottcd
with the results obtained from the S. C. M. arid X. The values for commercial have been
tabulated by percentage differancea between this fuel and X secured in another test.
Commercial gasoline is &fair sample of the fuel usually sold at automobile filling stations
and is of a lower grade than X. It was purchased under the United Statea General Supply
Committie Specifktion for 1918.
In” order that a f air comparison of the performance of the engine with the various fuels
could be made, the horsepowers in each case were corrected to 0° C. The method of making
this correction is described in Part I of Report No. 45.
Ii--working up the data secured from these taste, it was found that the homepower diflerencea, particularly at the lower altitudes, were so small as to make the usual method of fairing
curves too uncertain, This can easily be understood by reference to plot 1. It will be readily
seen that sevaral curves could be drawn through the points obtained from the tosia at 5,235
feet, any one of which might be considered as an average of the results. One set of curves

might show S. C. M. higher than X, and another, equally fair, might show S. C. M. lower
than X. It waa obvious, therefore, that some better method should be employed.
By drawing fair curves through the observed points the approximate horsepower at each
speed and pressure was obtained. These, in turn, were plotted against atmospheric pressure.
In this plot, the points lie very nearly on a straight line. It wss found that three out of the
four points did actually lie upon a straight $ne and the other very close to it. Repotting the
horsepower obtained from the straight lines against speed a second time showed the probable
error in plotting, and by carefully repeated trials, the curves of plot 1 were obtained. In
this way, the results obtained at one altitude ware used to check the results obtained at the
other altitudes.
One feature of the lines of horsepower plotted against barometric pressure was particularly helpful in this method of analysis. It was found that the intercepts of these lines on the
axis of zero ptessure were quite evenly spaced. For example, in the equation for the line
y=(zx-il
wherein y= horsepower
z= barometric prwsure in cm. IIg
the values of b increased by even increments, for even dit%rences of speed.
This method was employed for all three fuels involved, and the rauminder of the data for
plots 1 to 7, inclusive, was derived from these average curws
These results are also given
in t.abuhr form, at the end of this report.
Plot 1 shows the horsepowers of S. C. M., X, and commercial at various barometric
pressures, plotted against revohnfions per minute. These curves show a considerable gain in
horsepower of S. C. M. omr both X and commercial at the higher altitudes.
P1ots 2 t.a 5 show the horsepower plotted against altitude at diflerent speeds. Plot
2 shows that S. C. M. and X are praoticslIy the same for 1,500 revohdions per minute for the
entire range of altitudes. Plot 2. exhibits a slight divergence of the S. C. M. curve from that
of X with increase of altitude, while in plot 3 the two curves practically coincide at the
lower altitude, but diverge more than in plot 2 at the higher altitudes. “PIot 4 shows a
stilI wider divergence at 29,300 feet.
In plot 6 the percentage gain in power is plottti. against speed for S. C. M. as compared
with X and with commercial. Plot 7 shows the same results plotted against tdtitude at
various speeds. Both sets of curves simpiy accentuate the characteristics indicated by the
curves in the previous *w.
P1ot 8 is the distillation curve of the fuel obtained by the Uhited States Bureau of Mines
and according to the method described in Bureau of Mines Toehnical Paper No. 166. For the
purpose of comparison, the distillation curves of X and commercial are plotted on the same
plate.
Plots 9 to 11 are from the fuel-consumption determinations made during the teats.
Owing ta the unsatisfactory operation of the fuel-weighing device, thwe results should be
considered as comparative anly.
Plot 9 shows the actual fuel consumption in pounds pm horsepower hour plotted against
revolutions per minute. The curves are drawn through the arithmetic means of the various
points determined.
In plots 10 and 11 the differences in fuel consumption are pIotted as percentages of the
fuel consumption when using X fueL The lines are simply to assist in folIowing through the
various results. These @ures should not be mgsidared as final.
CONCLUSIONS.

Siial Corps mixture shows very little gain in power ss compared to X below 10,000 feet
altitude. Above that altitude thare is no gain of consequence at the lower speeds, but a
marked gain at the higher speeds. It is, therefcwe, to be considered a high-altitude fuel. The
fueI consumption would be about 4 per cent greater than X at the altitude where the fuel
gives ita best performance.
