INTRODUCTION.
Present weather conditions and those immediately in prospect,
especially those relating to air movement, have always been matters
of concern with navigators. In the days of sailing vessels weather
con ditions were of prune importance, and in the present age, when
steam and other engines are used in driving vessels, navigators are
still greatly dependent upon weather conditlOns, and the t ime is far
off, if indeed it eVer comes, when the navigation of the oceans will
be entirely independent of weather conditions, or when a knowledge
of them will not be of advantage to the navigator. In addition to
those weather conditions whicli interest the sailor, the aviator is
dependent upon and benefited by a lmowledge of the detailed structure of the medium which sustams his craft; and while he may to a
degree disregard atmospheric conditions, it is not likely that the time
will ever come when a knowledge of the air can not be used by him
to advantage. Just what information will be most useful to the
aviator is a question that experience and possible development of
aircraft must determine. More data than those now being obtained
will doubtless be required. The purpose of these brief notes is to
show the sort of atmospheric data available and to put the subject
in such shape as may make it bear directly on the problems which
are met in aviation.
The author desires to acknowledge the assistance of Mr. W. R.
Gregg, who has reduced the data on which these conclusions are based
and read the proof; also that of Profs. C. F . Marvin and J . F . Hayford,
who have kindly read and criticized the copy, making helpful suggestions thereon.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND DYNAMICS OF THE
ATMOSPHERE.

•

Atmosphe1'ic constituents.-Approximately 78 per cent, by volume,
of the air near the earth's surface is nitrogen and 21 per cent oxygen.
Another diatomic gas, hydrogen, is found uniformly distributed,
but in very small quantity. The monatomic gases, argon, neon,
helium, krypton, and xenon, are present, their volumes being in
the order given. Other gases and vapors of more complex molecular
structure and less uniformly distributed are water vapor, carbon
dioxide, ammonia, and sulphur dioxide. The last three gases named
are hygroscopic and seem to exi t in the atmosphere in association
with more or less water, depending on the amount of atmospheric
moisture available. Other gases, as well as dust of both terrestrial
and meteoric origin, are present in varying quantities, depending
on the time or location in which observations are made.
Dist1'ibution of constituent gases in the atmosphel'e.-In order of
their atomio weights the first eight of the gases mentioned are hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon.
When molecular weights are considered, neon is third in the list, and
nitrogen and oxygen fourth and fifth, respectively. It is probable
that these gases are sorted by gravity and that, as the distance from
the earth's surface increases, the proportion of the lighter gases increases until at some height, 150 kilometers or more above sea level,
the chief constituent of the air is hydrogen. Convective mixing of
the air interferes with this sorting to some extent, especially in the
lower 10 kilometers of the atmosphere.
Nucleation and condensation.-Recent observations and experiments indicate that the hygroscopic gases, rather than dust or IOns,
furnish the nuclei upon which the water vapor of the air condenses,
forming haze and fog or cloud. Strata of air that are hazy are
found to be rich in these hygroscopic nuclei and usually a disturbance that elevates such strata either in whole or in part results in
cloud formation. It may happen that the temperature of the air
in the haze layer is lowered without accompanying change of level,
with the result that a stratum of cloud replaces the stratum of haze.
When air of the haze layer is forced up in places by a relatively
strong vertical component in its motion, the resulting type of cloud
formation is cumulus; when it is cooled, either by bemg elevated
as a whole or by other means, the type of cloud resulting is stratus.

The formation of cumulus clouds therefore accompanies turbulent
atmospheric conditions, andis in turn an indication of the e conditions.
Pressure and units of measurements.-Atmospherio pressur are
most familiarly measured in inches or millimeters of tlle height of a
column that will just balance the static pressure of the air at a
given place. Thus, the standard pressure commonly designated one
atmosphere is a column of mercury 760 millimeters high having
a temperature of 0° C. under gravity at sea level and latitude
45° . The pressure of the atmosphere and local differences in these
pressures are forces capable of causing flow and motions of the air.
In order to be able readily to compare these forces with other forces
with which we are familiar it is most convenient in all aerological
studies to express the atmospheric pressure in dynes per square
centimeter, which is the unit commonly employed for the measurement of pressure. Meteorologists generally have agreed upon the
distinctive name "bar" for the unit for measurement of air and
similar gaseous pressures when exprossed in absolute units. A pressure of one bar is a force of 1,000,000 dynes per square centimeter
of area. It is exactly equivalent to the pressure of a mercury column
of 750.016 millimeters at 0° C. and reduced to standard gravity at
sea level and latitude 45°. The familiar standard atmosphere of
760 millimeters equals 1.0133 bars.l The millibar (mb.), i. e., 1,000
dynes per square centimeter, is the cu tomary subdivision of the
absolute unit , and in a barometric measurement is about threefour ths as large as the familiar unit "one millimeter of mercury."
Accordingly, pressures will hereafter be expressed in millibars. Sea
level pressure win range roughly between 995 and 1,060 millibars.
Air temperature and vertical motion.-The ratio of their specific

varies for the different constituent ga es of the atmosphere, being
about 1.3 for the group in which the molecules are triatomic or more
complex, 1.41 for the diatomic group and 1.66 for the monatomic

distance betwoen the stations i 100.5 meter. An air mass cool
1 0 C., therefore, in ascending approximately 100 meters, and of
course warms up 1 0 C. in descending the same distance. This statement is true only if no exchange of heat occurs either to or from the
air mass with the outside and if no latent heat of condensation or
evaporation enters into consideration.
Local heating.-In passing through the atmos£:~e to the earth's
surface the sun's radiant energy is considerably . 'nished by reflection from the upper surfaces of clouds and from other boundary surfaces that may exist between strata of dillerent densities or constitution. There is somo diminution of this energy becauso of direct
absorption by the ~ases of the atmosphere, but the amount thus
absorbed is relatively small. In general, the sun's rays are somewhat refracted by the atmosphere, and the amount of heat reaching
the earth by means of them is thus somewhat increased. Locally,
the amount of heat received from the sun by the earth's surface may
be increased considerably by reflection from the sides of clouds, and
it may, of course, be diminished in the cloud's shadow. Insolation,
the heating effect of the sun's rays measured at the earth's surface, i
considerably greater in the spaces between cumulus clouds, for
example, than under" normal" conditions, when there are no clouds
present. The air itself when dry absorbs but little of the sun's
energy, and i therefore but little heated by the direct rays of the sun.
The earth's surface reflects more or less of the solar radiation reaching it,
deJ)ending on the nature of the material forming it. Snow, ice, water,
and white sand, clay, or rock surfaces reflect more of the sun's radiation than do black, brown, or vegetation-covered fields. The color
of the surface is determined by the wave lengths it reflects mosta white surface reflects all wave lengths equally, while a black surface
absorbs all wave lengths and reflects none. Surfaces that are good
absorbers are good radiators, i. e., lose their heat readily by radiation
Surfaces that absorb less readily "hold their h eat," i. e., are not good
radiators. There is, however, less difference in the rapidity with
which these different surfaces communicate their heat to the air by
conduction.
Sources of atmospheric heat.-Altogether, cloudine s and other
factors considered, less than half the radiant heat from the sun
entering the outer portion of the earth's atmosphere succeeds in
penetrating to the lithosphere, where it becomes effective in heating
the earth's surface and the air near it. Notwithstanding this absorption, however, the atmosphere as a whole is but little heated by the
dircct rays of the sun. It is the earth's surface that is the chief
source of atmospheric heat, and, as has been shown, this surface
locally and in point of time receives varying amounts of heat from
the sun. This means that locally and in point of time the temperature of the earth's surface varies. The surface temperature in a
field of black earth is somewhat higher at 4 p. m. of a clear day than
is that of a green pasture adjoining it and deCIdedly higher than that of
a field of white wheat or wheat stubble in the same vicinity. At 4
a. m . these relations of temperature are reversed. Similar but more
marked differences of temperature are found between land and
water smfaces. To these must be added the temperature variations
accompanying elevation and latitude of the surface considered.

12

AERONAUTICS.

Oonduction and convection oj heat.-The earth's surface heats or
cools the air in contact with it largely by conduction. It follows
that air temperatures at lowest levels will vary in the same sense as
do the temperatures of the earth's surface, but not necessarily to the
same extent. Convection processes in the air will then distribute
the heat. During insolation the air lying on the earth's surface is
likely to be receiving some heat from the earth by conduction; at
night it is likely to be giving up heat to the earth. As water is
evaporated from lakes, etc., the heat of evaporation is furnished by
the earth's sUlface; and this heat is supplied to the air at higher
levels as heat of condensation when the moisture condenses; e. g.,
wherever fog or cloud forms or wherever condensation of 'Vapor
yields any form of precipitation.
Radiation and absorption oj heat.-The proportions of the constituent gases in the atmosphere at any pornt exert some influence
on the air temperature at that point. If a given level in the atmosphere is considered, the inflow through it of energy from the sun
and the outflow through it of ener~y from the earth's surface and
from that part of the atmosphere t>elow the level in question are,
in the long run, equal. This energy is either transmitted through
the atmosphere without heating it or is, to a greater or less degree,
passed along by the process of absorption and re-radiation. In the
latter case the air is neated to such a temperature that equilibrium is
established between the rates of absorptIOn and re-radiation. This
temperature is different for the different atmospheric constituents,
being proportional to their abilities to absorb solar and terrestrial
radiation. While the amount of solar radiation absorbed in its
passage down through a clear atmosphere to the earth's surface is
relatively small, about two-thirds of this amount is absorbed by the
water vapor of the air. On the other hand, a large percentage of terrestrial radiation is absorbed as it flows out through the atmosphere
and most of this absorption again is by the water vapor of the air.
The earth's surface is therefore to be thought of as by far the most
important source of atmospheric heat. When temperature distribution in the atmosphere is thought of from this point of view,
the earth's surface temperatul'e, i. e., the earth's potential as a
radiator, must be taken into account.
Air movement.-The density of adjacent portions of stationary
free air in equilibrium under the attraction of gravity varies in a
definite way from one surface or stratum to the next higher or lower
one, but the density tends to be uniform throughout one and the
same surface, which may therefore be called an equigravic surface.
An equigravic surface as applied to atmospheric conditions passes
through portions of the air having the same gravitational potential.
Arrangements of air densities not in conformity with the foregoing
requirements are accompanied by motions. The denser portions or
air, being pulled down by gravity, spread out, pa.rtially mingle and
replace the less dense portions, which are pushed up, but are commonly said to ascend, and may also intermingle and spread out until
equilibrium is established. Both vertical and horizontal components
of motion are necessary in restoring equilibrium. If the composition of the air moistOl'e contents, etc., were exactly the same over a
considerable extent, then equigravic surfaces for a state of equilibrium
would be horizontal surfaces.

The density of air at constant pressure depends largely on its
temperature, but to an extent also on its constitution. In the lower
strata of the atmos1?here moisture is the only constituent whose
quantity varies suffiCIently to affect air density appreciably. It has
been shown above not only that air temperature varies from point
to point in the atmosphere but that the moisture content also varies.
Usually temperature and moisture content affect air density in the
same sense, 1. e., an increase in either makes the density less. Near
the earth's surface, where the moisture content and the temperature of the air are rather directly controlled by the nature of that
surface, maxima and minima of air density may be found within a
few meters, or even a few centimeters, distance. Farther away from
the earth's surface these maxima and minima of density are farther
apart. Whatever the dimensions of the air mass considered, therefore, it is likely to contain one or more complete circulatory systems
in process of adjusting the differences in density of its parts; and
it itself is likely to be movin~) in conformity with the need for similar
adjustment on a larger scale.
Oonvective systems.-In the process of adjusting these differences
in atmospheric density still another factor in the distribution of
temperature is introduced. Air masses, with their heat content, are
earned bodily from place to j)lace without change of level and consequently with comparatively little change in temperature, volume and
pressure. Air masses also change level which entails change of
pressure and volume. Work is done when the volume of a given
mass of air is changed. When its volume increases, the energy for
this work must be furnished either by outside sources or by the gas
itself; when the volume decreases, energy is given to outside objects
or to the gas itself. When the energy is all supplied by or to the air
mass itself, the temperature change ill the air mass is 1 0 C. per 100
meters, as has been shown above (p. 11). It is clear that the total
heat content of the atmosphere can not be changed by these motions
of the air, for under the conditions of our atmosphere as much air
must go up as comes down and, if air moves from the point A to the
point B, air from B, or air displaced by air from B, etc., moves to
the point A. Because quantities of heat are carried about in these
circulatory systems and also because temperature differences are the
prime causes of the differences in density giving rise to them, they
are often called convective systems.
Ascending air.-An ascending air mass may have the energy required for its expansion furnished in part by absorbing radiant heat
and by the heat of condensation of water vapor that may take place
within it. It will lose some heat by conduction to adjacent air
masses, by mixture of air near its boundaries with air of these masses,
and by radiation. The percentage of the required energy which
may be furnished by absorption (conduction and radiation also
included) depends on the rate of expansion or of ascent of the air
mass. It is always small and probably not considerable, except for
rates of ascent well below 1 meter per hour. The percentage of
required energy furnished by heat of condensation of water vapor
may be as high as 60 or more after condensation begins, depending
on the amount of water vapor present. When precipitation occurs,
the net result, so far as air temperature is concerned, is the transfer
to the air, in the condensation level, of energy originally derived from

14

the earth's surface when the water forming the precipitation was
evaporated.
Descending air.-A descending air mass may furnish heat to adjacent air masses by conduction, to objects or air at a distance by
radiation, or it may supply heat of evaporation to water suspended
in it as mist or cloud. Some radiant heat may be absorbed by the
air mass as it descends. The conduction effect is small. The absorption and radiation effects are smaller than in the case of an ascending
air mass, because of the relative dryness of the descending air mass.
The amount of heat of condensatlOn supplied to ascending air is,
of course, far in excess of the heat of evaporation given up by descending air. It follows that the adiabatic rate of decrease in temperature with height, i. e., 1 0 C. per 100 meters, is more nearly realized
ill descending than in ascending air currents.
Extent and rate of air movement.-When any convective system is
considered, the extent of horizontal motion in the air affected is
determined by the horizontal distance apart of the maximum and
minimum air densities of the system and on the direction of the
motion between these two points. The extent of the vertical motion
in any system depends on the condition of equilibrium 1 of the air
mass involved and on the magnitude in any equigravic surface, of
the difference between the maximum and minimum of air density.
The rate of motion either horizontal or vertical depends on the rate
of change of density in any equigravic surface of the system. Compared with the rates of horizontal air movement observed, vertical
motion is very slow. Horizontal movement of 25 meters per second
is frequently recorded, especially at some distance above the earth's
surface, and rates of three times this have been observed. It is
estimated that over the thermal equat~r the air is rising at the rate
of about one meter per hour. Rates of vertical motion as high as
4 or 5 meters per second may occur locally; e. g., in the deeper
cumulus clouds.2
Atmospheric equilibrium.-The condition of equilibrium of the
atmosphere or any part of it depends on the vertical distribution
of its density. Since density depends largely on temperature, the
vertical distribution of temperature is the best direct indication of
the equilibrium. If potential temperature (defined below) rather
than actual temperature is considered, the relation of temperature
to equilibrium becomes more direct and apparent. The potential
temperature at any point in the atmosphere is the temperature,
expressed on the absolute scale, which would be assumed by the air
about that point, if this air were changed adiabatically to standard
pressure. The potential temperature of a gas, like its entropy,
remains constant throughout a reversi"Qle or strictly adiabatic cycle
of changes and increases for an irreversible process. When in any
I The condition of equilibrium of any system under the influence of any force whatever is stable if, when
slightly disturbed from Its position of equlJjbrlum, its 'potential energy is increased, neutral if its potential
energy remains unchanged, and unstable if its potential energy is decreased . An air mass in equlhbrium
undor the action of ll'"avity is in stable equilibrium il, when an}' part of it is slightly disturbed in a vertical
direction, its potential energy is increased, neutral if Its potential energy remains unchanged, and unstable
it its potential energy is decreased, i. e., in addition to overcoming the inertia of the disturbed part of the
air mass, the disturbing force must do work on this part of tho air mass, in order to effect its change of level,
if the air mass be in stable equilibrium, no work is done, either by the disturbing force or by the part of
the air mass changing level if the air mass be in neutral equilibrium, and work is done by the part of the
air mass disturbed if the condition of equilibrium of tbe air mass be unstable. In otber wordS, the atmosphere, in its average condition of equilibrium (see par. 15, following), more or less strongly resists vertical
motion, depending on the degree 0/ its stability.

region of the atmosphere the rate of fall of temperature with altitude
is 1 0 C. per 100 meters, i. e., the adiabatic rate, the potential temperature is constant throughout the region and the state of equilibrium
is neutral. If now, in the upper part of this region, the aIr density
increases by an amount such that the additional pull of gravity on
account of this increase in density is sufficient to overcome friction,
downward motion will result. On the other hand, if air in the lower
part of this region decreases in density by a sufficient amount, upward
motion will result. In either case a state of lIDstable equilibrium is
brought about. Since in the free air density varies quite directly
with temperature, this unstable state is accompanied by a temperature-altitude relation of more than 1 0 C. per 100 meters or by a
decrease of potential temperature with height. When the potential
temperature increases with height, i. e. , when the temperaturealtitude relation- is less than the adiabatic rate for dry air, the state
of equilibrium is stable, and the degree of stability is indicated by
the rate of increase of potential temperature with height. In a region
of neutral equilibrium, air in low levels, which becomes warmer, that
is, less dense than its environment, will, barring friction, ascend
indefinitely to the top of the region in question or until its excess
of heat is lost by radiation or exchange with its surrounding air.
,Similarly, in the higher levels any portion of such air which becomes
caoler or denser than surrounding portions will descend to the bottom
layeIS unless st~ed by loss of its excess density due to heating
from wi,thout. When the equilibrium is stable warm light air can
rise bll :t a limited amount and then come to rest, because it soon
enters strata having the same temperature and density as its own.
SimilarlYr cold heavy air in the higher levels of a stable system can
descend but, a limited distance before it comes to rest in a stratum
of its own temperature and density.1
Variations irc:"atmospheric eg.uilibrium.-As a whole, and on the
average for any particular re~on, the atmosphere is in stable equilibrium. It is only I. for limitea times and regions that neutral or unstable states of equ.ilJ.;.nrium exist. The neutral and unstable states are
found most frequently U!urin~ insolation and near the earth's surface. They may extend to t,ne 2-kilometer level and in some cases
higher. In general, stability i'mcreases with latitude. The air is in
more stable equilibrium in wirl\ter than in summer and at nighttime than during insolation. Tli~s is especially true of the stratum
in which turbulence is most likely 'Ilia occur. On a clear, quiet summer
day it is often possible to observ~ the process of conversion from
st able to neutral and unstable eq ilibrium of the air in the lower
stratum. As insolation heats the arth's surface, the air in contact
with that surface becomes heated 8J.lJ.d to such an extent that its pot ential temperature is higher than tb',t of the air immediately above
it. The result is the descent and sp~ading out of the air of lower
potential temperature and the ascent and spreading out of the air
of higher potential temperature. Th , vertical extent of this circulation is but a meter or two at the S'.t.art and gradually increases
with the increase in the temperature 0\( the earth's surface. It
often happens that the air within the neutial or unstable region is

hazy compared with the air above it. To one on a hill or mountain
top this haze level is distinctly visible by the time it has risen well
above the tree and house tops and its upward progress can be noted.
The term "haze level" is a natural one because, to the observer, the
boundary between the air in stable and that in unstable equilibrium
is clearly defined and appears to be very approximately level. The
rate of rise of the haze level for given conditions of the earth's surface seems to vary inversely with the stability of the air above it,
i. e., inversely with the rate of increase of potential temperature
with height. Consequently, the height to which turbulence of this
sort can attain in a given region, by the time the earth's surface
has reached its maximum temperature for the day, varies inversely
with the stability of air over this region when insolation began.
This height has been found to be about 1 kilometer above the earth's
surface for a clear winter day and 1.5 kilometers for a clear summer
day, at an inland. location and over open farmed land in which are
occasional patches of timber.
Types Of convective systems.-The type of convective system thus
far considered is one which has its origin in a difference of air density
over a given equigravic surface. Illust.rations of this type of convective system are the planetary system of convection, the diurnal
system, and those currents set up because of differences in the nature
or elevation of the earth's surface, such as land and water systemS'>:
mountain and valley systems, also of combinations of these. Th-ese
systems are essentially local, either in point of time or location on
the earth's surface. In addition to these, there are traveling convective systems, such as those attending maxima and mirluna of
pressure as they pass from west to east, hurricanes, thundrarstorms,
and tornadoes, the origin of which can not be so direct\y or completely ascribed to a difference in density over an eqlli:gravic surface.
Degree of reversibility of atmospheric processes.-j!:rreversibility in
atmospheric processes may result largely from chan:ge in the constitution of the air concerned in the processes, but aJ..~0 ill some measure
to the absorption and radiation of heat by thifb air. So far as the
atmosphere has been explored, the constitJaent most concerned in
this change, as well as the one responsiMe for a large percentage of
the absorption and radiation of hefltG by the air, is water vapor.
Great changes in water vapor cont(~nt occur, as a rule, only in the
first 3 or 4 kilometers of the atub.osphere. In this region, therefore, processes are least nearly rJeversible.
Complete reversibility of atmosipheric processes seems to. be more
'
closely approximated, as distan~from the earth's surface illcreases.
If the changes taking place wit lin a convective unit are rev~rsible,
the unit is self-contained and J ' dere~dent ?f adjacent urut~ .. If
these changes are irreversible, tZh~ urut IS not illdependen~ of slIDllar
adjacent units and their airs JilllX .to an extent depending on the
degrees of irreversibility in 1Ihe uruts concerned. If tJ:1e proce.sses
in the convective unit repres4mted by the trade and antItrade WInds
were reversible the air of t we antitrades would all have returned to
the trades by the time it b la.d reached the no~thern limit of the trades
(confining t he illustratio"4 to the. northern SIde of the t~ermal equator). The air of the a-dttItrades IS not able to return directly to t!?-e

earth's surface and either returns to the trades from higher latitudes
or replaces air of another convective unit which in turn must supply
some air to the trades. This condition results in the passing of
more or less oppositely directed air currents on the earth's surface,
the air in these passing CUlTents being as a rule quite differently constituted. There are many ways in which thelassing of
differently constituted airs in nearly oppositely directe currents
is brought about. In the Tropics, for example, where insolation is
high, a local land. and water convective system may create air currents counter to the prevailing trades.
Influence of the earth's rotatwn.-Because of the earth's rotation,
air (or other matter) in horizontal motion over the earth's surface is
acted on by a deflecting force, to the right in the northern hemisphere,
to the left in the southern hemisphere. This force is 2w m V sin }.;
where w is the angular velocity of the earth's rotation (i.e . . 86;~4)'
m is the mass of the body acted on, V is the speed of motion of the
body, and A is the latitude. It is important to note that this force
is zero at the Equator, but increases to 2wm V as the poles are
approached.
If, then, a current of air is flowing along a straight line on the
earth's surface (i.e. along a great circle) in a frictionless manner at a
uniform speed, this deflective influence due to the earth's rotation
must be balanced by an equal and opposite force. This last is due to
the pressure gradient in the atmosphere, which is by definition lerpendicular to the isobars. It follows, then, that the current 0 air
must be along a path exactly at right angles to the gradient, that
is, parallel to the isobars. It is seen without difficulty that this

•

pressure gradient ~p = 2pw V sin A, where p is the density of the air.
Taking A 45°, the pressure gradient across an air current moving
at 11 m.p.s. is Ii millibars, or 1 rom. of mercury, per 100
kilometers, or approximately 0.1 inch of mercury per 158 miles.
Eleven m.p.s. is the mean wind speed for the year, observed about
300 meters above the surface at Mount Weather, Va. Actual speeds
may depart far from this mean in either sense. Summer windS are,
as a rule, slower and winter winds faster than this mean.
If the current of air has a constant speed V in a circle of radius T,
there must be a force acting on each particle of the air in toward the
center of curvature equal to m P/r; the deflective force due to the
earth's rotation acts in this direction in an anticyclonic system
(i. e., a "high") in the northern hemisphere and opposite to this
direction in a cyclonic system (1.. e., a "low"). It follows at once that
the force due to the pressUl'e gradient must be radially out in a high,
and radially in in a low, and that therefore the lines of flow of the current are parallel to the isobars. It is obvious, then, that in order
to have a uniform flow at speed V, friction being assumed negligible,
in a curve of radius T, V must satisfy the following condition:
p v2 = ± (pressure gradient - 2 pw V sin A),
T

where the plus sign applies to a cyclonic and the minus sign to an
anticyclonic system. The V which satisfies this equation IS called
the" gradient velocity."

Frictio n is never absent, however, in the movem ent of air;
conseq uently the force due to this should be taken into accounand
t in
the above equatio ns. The line of flow will never be quite paralle
l
to the isobars ; and the angle of inclina tion will be such that the force
due to the pressu l'e-gra dient-w hich is perpen dicular to the isobar
will have a compo nent along the line of flow sufficient to overco sme
the force of friction.
Pressure distribution.-A nothe r descrip tion of the conditi on existing owing to the earth's rotatio n is to say that there is a region
of
low pressur e on the left sides of two oppo itely directe d passing
curren ts of air, and one of high pressu re on their right
i. e.,
two opposi tely directe d passing curren ts of air will ha'Ve sides,preslow

in
these curren ts are usually differently constit uted, especially in respec
to water 'Vapor, and of different temper ature. The pressu re gradie t
nt
is therefo re in such a directi on as to cause them to mix on

to be sufficient continually to realign the passing air currents of the
lower stratum, which in turn are responsible for the pressure variation. This realignment keeps up with the movement of the air in
the upper of the two strata and results in a moving disturbance in
the lower of these strata. This mechanism, more or less modified
by atmospheric conditions, such as temperature distribution and
humidity, in the lower stratum, seems in general to control the motion
of trave'iillg disturbances in the surface stratum of the atmosphere
and explains the fail-Iy well established fact of observation, viz, that
all traveling disturbances in the surface stratum have, in general,
the speed and direction of the air movement in the stratum immediately above. Tropical hurricanes, for example, seem to move with
the antitrades, the high and low pressure areas of the middle latitudes with the up~er westerlies. The same mechanism is operati'Ve
in the "separation' of lows from a semipermanent low and of highs
from a semipermanent high. The semipermanent high or low is
a surface stratum phenomenon and has Its position fiXed by local
conditions and must itself r6main in place, but it does create the
disturbance or gust in the moving air of the stratum immediately
above, which is carried forward !1Ud in its turn interacts with the
air of the lower stratum. The result is that a traveling high or low,
as the case may be, seems to "separate" from the semipermanent
high or low and continue in the general direction of the upper current. .A traveling disturbance is likely to decrease in intensity when
there is a southward component in Its motion as a whole and to
increase in intensity, when there is a northward componont in its
motion, in accord with the value, 2wp V sin h, which increases with
latitude.

TOPOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATIC FACTORS IN RELATION
TO AERONAUTICS.

Location and use oj base statior!.8.-A knowledge of climatic conditions is of advantage in the selection of locations for aeronautic base
stations and in the placing of the fields and buildings. If the region
in which a station is located is mountainous or forested or in the
vicinity of very high buildings, an exploration of the air to such
heights as will include all the peculiarities of circulation introduced
by these obstructions to the normal flow of the air is also of decided
advantage in this connection. Even when the location of a base
station is completely determined by strategic or other considerations
aside from climate, the climatic and aerological surveys are of
decided value in the plan and use of the station. These meteorological factors have to do with behavior of the engine, with the methods
and material used in the construction of the craft, and especially with
the ease and frequency of accessibility of the station by aerial routes
to aircraft of all kinds.
Disturbances caused by buildings.-From a meteorological point of
view places only a few miles apart may vary greatly in theIr desirability as locatIOns for base stations. Peculiarities of topography,
isolated trees, forests, or tall buildings may produce troublesome and
often dangerous disturbances in winds that otherwise would be
fairly steady. Figure 1 illustrates a disturbance caused in a 22
m. p . s. (50 mi. p. h.) wind by a small round tower. The tower is 5!
meters (18 feet) in diameter at the base, tapers slightly to the eaves,
and has a height to the point of the roof of about 6 meters (20 feet)
above the ground level. The ground was kept bare of snow for a
width of about 3 meters (10 feet) and a distance of 160 meters (525
feet) to the leeward of the building, at which point the surface took
a decided downward sl()pe. As the air current passed the tower two
helices were formed. To one standing in the tower the rotation of
the air in the helix on his right was counterclockwise; in the helix on
his left clockwise, as shown by the suspended snow. The air descending in the middle of the path swept the snow outward and
forward to both sides.
Gustiness caused by topography.-Figure 2 illustrates the changes
in the horizontal rate of movement of the air as they occur in the
average westerly wind near the earth's surface. On the average,
the acceleration in the horizontal component of the wind speed
shown is about 7.5 centimeters per second. Accelerations of three
or four times this amount are frequently observed. It would

require a positive horizontal acceler ation of 17 to 20 times this
amount to sustain a bird or well-constructed airplane in soaring
flight. In other words, 5 per cent of the force required to sustain the
plane is furnished by the average acceleration in the horizontal component of the wind illustrated. An airplane in flight through the
wind would experience now this 5 per cent increase and in a few
seconds or less time a decrease of equal amount, or a total change of
one-tenth the force required to sustain it. Going into the wind the
plane would rise in the increasing and fall in the decreasing wind.
Going with the wind, the OpposIte would be true. The effect on
the airplane of the variations in air pressure accompanying these
changes in the horizontal speed of the aIr movement is comparatively
inconsiderable. Observations of air pressure made near the earth's

surface indicate that a pressure variation of one-half of 1 per cent of
the total air pressure within a horizontal distance of 30 meters (100
feet) would be an extremely large variation, found only in such severe
disturbances as thunderstorms or tornadoes. Air den ity varies
diredly as the air pressure, and the support given an airplane in a
given air mass vanes with the air density. It follows that in this
extreme case the e:£l'ect of density variation would hardly be noticeable to the pilot of an airplane compared with the effects of the
variations in wind speed illustrated.
Vertical rrwtion in gusts. -These changes in the horizontal component of the air movement must necessarily be accompanied b y
similar changes in the vertical component. The vertical changes
are relatively small in amount, being, in a surface wind of this sort,
merely the vertical motion incident to the expansion and contraction
of the air as it adapts itself to the contour of the bottom over which it
flows. Depending of course on the position of the planes this vertical component of motion is much more effective in proportion to its
speed in sustaining an airplane in the air or in forcmg it down. I n
general, however, it is likely that the aviator attaches undue importance to the effects of vertical motion in comparison with the

effects of changes in the horizontal speed of air movement. (See
part 1, p. 14.)
The extent of di turbances caused by topography.-Depending on
the contour of the earth's surface and on the speed of the wind,
gusts of this sort may extend to a hei~ht of 40 or 50 meters (130 to
160 feet) or ~gher . That part of the Blue Ridge Mountains on
which Mount Weather is located rises fully 300 meters (1,000 feet)
above the valley floors on either side of the ridge. The disturbing
effect of this ridge on a wind at or nearly at right angles to the ridge
has been observed to extend from 700 to 900 meters (2,250 to 3,000
feet) above the mountain top. The greater heights were observed
in the winds of higher speeds. It is probable tliat disturbances in
the lower air brought about mechanically by such obstacles in the
path of the wind as trees, buildings, hills, and mountains seldom
extend higher than four times the height of obstacles above the
general level of the earth's surface in the vicinity of the obstacles.
The nature of the disturbance caused depends on the contour of the
obstacle and wind speed. Figure 1 illustrates one type. Another
and a more common type has frequently been observed on a large
scale at Mount Weather. In the cases above mentioned, where the
disturbance extended to a height of 700 to 900 meters (2,250 to 3,000
feet) above the top of the ridge, the effect of the ridge was to deflect
the air upward at all levels above the top of the ridge and for some
distance to the leeward. The air in the lower part of this deflected
current, soon after passing the top of the ridge, had a downward
component of motion which brought it to the valley floor at a distance away from the foot of the mountain, depending on the wind
speed. The horizontal component of the motion of this air decreased so that at a distance of sometimes as much as ten times the
height of the ridge above the valley floor, the air was descending
vertically on the valley floor, part of it returning toward the foot
of the mountain and part of it going on out into the valley. That
part of the air returrung toward the ridge continued up the side of
the mountain to near the top, turning here again 10 join the general
current. In one instance a wind of 27 meters per second (60 miles
per hour) carried away a kite that was flying at a height of less than
1,000 meters (3,300 feet) above the mountain top. The falling
kite was followed by means of a theodolite in order to determine
accurately its landing place. After it 1?assed below the level of the
mountain top it seemed to descend rapIdly into a well-known patch
of woods about 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the station; but before
reaching the woods it was caught in a fairly strong wind blowing
toward the mountain and carried back to within about 2 kilometers
(Ii miles) of the station before it finally settled to the earth's surface.
Disturbances caused by local heating.-The earth's surface varies
considerably with regard to its power to absorb radiation and thus
becomes more or less heated locally. (See part 1, pp. 10 and 11.)
Abrupt and frequent variations of this sort in the vicinity of an
aviation field n eed close attention. They intensify considerably the
condition of "roughness" or "bumpiness" of the air that prevails at
certain times and places, sometimes to the height of It kilometers
(about 1 mile) above the earth's surface. Assume that the air overlying a certain area is in stable equilibrium at the time insolation begins on any clear day. A part of the sun's heat incident on the outer
atmosphere reaches 'the earth's surface but without affecting to any

24

AERONAUTICS.

considerable extent the condition of equilibrium of the air through
which it passes. A large part of the sun's heat incident on the earth's
surface is absorbed and tlie surface thereby heated. The air in contact with the earth's surface is heated by conduction, decreases in density somewhat and changes places with relatively denser air immediately above it. Thus, the process of transformation from a condition
of stable to a condition of neutral or of unstable equilibrium is initiated.
It has been shown (see part 1, p. 14) that the rate at which this transformation proceeds upward depends on the rate of heating of the
earth's surlace and on the initial stability of the atmosphere immediately above it. Over a plowed field, therefore, which absorbs a certain amount of the sun's heat, the transformation will proceed upward
at a given rate. Over a neighborin~ field of, say, wheat stubble, the
surface of which reflects more and absorbs less of the sun's heat than
does the surface of the plowed field, the transformation will proceed
at a slower rate. At some equigravic surface, below the transformation level over the plowed field, but above this level over the stubble
field, the density of the air over the plowed field will be less than that
over the stubble field, and, as indicated in paragraph 9, chapter 1, a
local con'Vective system the dimensions of which depend on the areas
of the fields in question will be set up by way of distributing the heating effects of the two fields. It is clear that small local convective
systems of this sort must occur in such a way as to either increase or
decrease the general air movement over this part of the earth's surface
and that vertical components of air movement will also be added, thus
increasing the" roughness" or "bumpiness" of this air to an airplane
passing through it.
Climatic jactoTs.-When a larger territory is considered, climatic
conditions are found to vary greatly from place to place. These
climatic conditions determine in a general way what aeronautic work
can best be done in any part of the country and the desirability of any
particular place as a location for an aeronautic field and base station.
Data are now in the Weather Bureau files sufficient for the purpose of
comparing different 'places throughout the country with respect to their
accessibility by aerIal routes for different types of aircraft, i. e., the
sort of aerial harbor, ease of entrance and exit, and other things considered which aircraft would find at these places. These data for any
place and the inferences based on them can be made available on short
notice. The climatic factors that most need consideration in this
connection are outlined as follows:
1. Wind:
(a) Direction.
(b) Speed.
2. Temperature:
(a) Normal.
(b) Maximum and minimum.
3. Precipitation :

(b) Excessive.
4. Fog.
5. Relative humidity.
6. Cloudiness.
7. Air pressure.
8. Thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes.

Use of Climatic data.-Some discussion of the separate topics in
the above outline may serve to indicate the reason for theIT consideration, the form in which the data can be found, and the way
in which they can best be used. In general data should be considered
by months and the suitability of any location as an aerial harbor
determined in this way. A place may be an excellent one for aeronautic operations during certain months of the year but less suitable
during other months. This distribution of suitability throughout
the year is of J>rime importance and the study of the data by months
enables it to be determined with sufficient closeness.
Wind speed and direction.-The prevailing direction of the wind
and the mean speed of the wind from each direction at a place selected
for the establishment of an aeronautic station should largely determine the layout of the grounds and the orientation of the buildings.
All aircraft, but specially those of the lighter-than-air types, can leave
or enter a hangar with greater ease and with less likelihood of damage
to the craft when going into the wind than when the wind or a considerable component of it blows across the entrance of the hangar.
For heavier-than-air machines it is specially important that the
field be so laid out as to furnish plenty of clear way for launching
and landing parallel to the prevailing wind directions. Prevailing
wind directIOn by months and also by hours for the 24-hour period,
together with the mean speed of the wind from each direction, can
be furnished by the Weather Bureau for a large number of places
well distributed throughout the country.
GaZes.-Winds of high speed render the launching and landing of
aircraft difficult. The limit of wind speed above which it is inadvisable to attempt launching aircraft varies with the type of machine.
Pertinent information on this point is found in the Weather Bureau
records of the number of days with gales at its different stations.
Wind direction and gustiness.-It is much more difficult to handle aircraft in a gusty than in a smoothly flowing wind. Gustiness is
usually measured and expressed as the rate of change from second
to second in the horizontal speed of the wind'. Change of speed in the
horizontal direction is, as a rule, accompanied by more or less change
of speed in a vertical direction, and may be taken as a fair indication
of the turbulence of the air current from the aviator's point of view.
As a rule west winds are gustier and therefore "bumpier" than
east winds. This difference in the nature of the winds is not based
on the wind direction at all but follows largely from the relative
densities of the air flowing in these currents. The air in a west wind,
because it is moving in the same direction as the surface of the
rotating earth, exerts a very slightly greater downward rressure,
depending on its rate of movement, than does air of equa density
moving from the east. If two such currents met, the tendency
would be for the west wind to keep to the earth's surface, forcing
the east wind to a higher level. It is also true that the air of westerly
winds in this country is usually drier and colder and therefore denser
than the air of easterly winds. As a result of this difference in density
the westerly wind lies close to the bottom over which it is flowing.
If this bottom be a topographically rough part of the earth's surface
much local expansion and contraction, or gustiness, will occur in the
westerly air current as it adapts itself to the topography. Such
gustiness would not occur in a wind that did not lie so close to the
bottom over which it is flowing. A sea breeze, for example, regardless

of its direction, is likely to be much freer from gusts and consequently
smoother than the land breeze over the same point. The air of the
Sea breeze flows over a comparatively smooth, unifdrm surface, while
that of the land breeze flows over a comparatively rough solid surface
the nature of which may also vary greatly from place to place.
Air temperature and "roughness."-The normal air temperature at
a place used as an aeronautic base, also the minimum temperatures
likely to be experienced, is of interest in connection with the operation of the engine and the comfort of the pilot and others handling
the machinery. The maxima of temperature likely to be experienced are of interest from this and also from an entirely different
point of view. It is likely that all days with temperatures 320 C.
(90 0 F.) or above will be days on which the surface air is quite rough
because of considerable convectional action. The depth of the rough
or bumpy air increases during insolation until well into the afternoon.
Depending on the length of the diurnal period of insolation the maximum depth of this condition on a clear day is likely to be 1 to 1!
kilometers (! to 11' miles). It is turbulence of this type that is
specially likely to be increased by sharp variations in the nature of
the earth's surface with respect to its ability to absorb or reflect
solar radiation.
Precipitation.-Precipitation, whatever its form, is not necessarily a hindrance to fl;v..ng, but the added weight on the aircraft, as
well as the poor visibllity, are great handicaps, and excessive precipitation of any form may render flight impossible. The added
weight of rain or snow on the craft may be considerable. A snow
cover, especially when the snow h as freshly fallen, so changes the
appearance of the earth's surface and covers up roads and other
lines that the aviator has difficulty in keeping his course.
Fog.-Fog is a serious hindrance to aerial navigation. It is practically impossible to keep a course in a given horizontal plane or
indeed to know in what plane the craft lies.
Humidity .-Whether the relative humidity is high or low is not
an imyortant consideration unless the air is so extremely dry that
specia care is required in seasoning the wood used in the propellers
and other parts of the craft, as well as in the construction of these
parts and in the glues and varnishes used. The amount of moisture
ill the air affects the operation of the gasoline engine, but this is a
point of secondary consideration.
Oloudiness.- While in military operations the aeronaut may use
a cloud cover to advantage, the average pilot in times of peace prefers a clear sky when he flies. The presence in the sky of certain
types of clouds." viz, clouds which form because there is an upward
component in tne movement of the air below them, indicates a more
or l~ss turbulent condition of the air from the earth's surface up to
the cloud base as well as within the cloud itself. Such clouds may
be scattered cumuli or in the form of a fairly solid cover, In every
case the bases of the seI>aI'ate clouds or of the cover appear sharply
defined and uniform in height. The disturbed condition of the air
within the cloud may well be thought of separately from that below
the cloud base since in the cloud other causes of turbulence are in
operation owing to the presence of the cloud particles. These
causes produce turbulence within clouds of other types as well as
in those which form in air having a vertical component in its motion.
While the pilot may expect "rough" air within any cloud, the pres-

ence of the convectional cloud forms, specially of scattered cumulus
clouds, leads him to expect "rough" air below the cloud level as
well. (See part 1, pp. 9 and 10.)
Frost and ice jormations on aircrajt.-Aircraft remaining for
some time in a fog or cloud layer, when the latter is at low temperatures, are likely to collect a considerable weight of moisture in
one form or another. This is specially true of the lighter-than-air
craft. Cloud and fog particles maintain themselves in liquid form
at temperatures far below freezing. If this be because of the sur.:
face tension of the particle, any influence that breaks down this
tension would permit the freezing in one form or another of the
water of the particle. Assuming that aircraft within a fog or cloud
layer at temperatures well below freezing is electrically charged,
surface tension of fog or cloud particles approaching it will be broken
dO\Vll and, dependirig on the size of the particle and the temperature, freeze on the cold surface of the aircraft in crystalline or
amorphous form. Similar conditions, but with higher temperatures, may result in the collection of liquid moisture on the surface
of the craft.
The air pressure.-The air pressure, or the height above sea level
of an aeronautic base station, affects chiefly the operation of the
gasoline engines.
Traveling disturbances considered.-While this chapter concerns
itself chiefly with the sort of aerial harbor that can be had in any
particular location and not with the laying or pursuit of a course
between two points, it is thought best not to divide the consideration of the next tOllic-thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanesalthough it h~ to do with courses pursued between two stations as
well as with the accessibility of either station by aerial routes .
Thunderstorms, hurricanes, and t01'1wdoes.-These are disturbances in the lower atmos:phere of relatively small area and may
often be seen aJ>proaching ill good time for the pilot, if he be in the
air, either to fly around them or to land until the disturbance has
pa..c;sed. The aeronaut would benefit greatly by some knowledge of
the nature and extent of these disturbances.
Frequency of thunderst01"m8, etc.-The frequency of occurrence
of disturbances of these sorts in a given region may be taken as an
indication of the turbulence of the air in that region. Consequently
data on thunderstorm frequency, for exam:ple, would be of value in
the consideration of a locatIOn for a base statIOn. Such data are in the
Weather Bureau records and are readily available.
A thundersto1"/n described.-During a kite flight of June 21, 1916,
at the Drexel Aerological Station, 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of
Omaha, there occurred a typical thunderstorm. Figure 3 shows the
temperature gradient observed in both ascent and descent. Wind
directions and speeds, cloud base heights, and other notes are made
on the curves showing the temperature-altitude relation. Figures
4, 5, and 6 are the barogram, thermogram, and hygrogram, respectively, recorded during the 'passing of the storm. The observer of
surface meteorological conditions makes the following notes :
Thunder to the west was heard at 12.15 p. m. A threatening, dark, purple-tinted
cloud was observed to the north and west of the station at 12.30 p. m. Lightning
fla.shes were seen in this cloud at about the same time. The wind changed from
ESE . to WNW. at 12.40 p. m . The loudest thunder was heard at 12.46 p. m . Light
rain began at 12.47 p. m. and heavy rain a minute later. Last thunder was heard to
the northeast at 1.05 p. m. Rain ended at 1.54 p. m.

AER.ONAUTICS.

The observer at the kite station makes the additional observations :
Reeling in at high speed th e kites passed directly over the reel house when the
wind changed abruptly from ESE . to WNW., i . e., the wind did not swing in a semicircle but changed by directly reversing its direction. There was evidence of an
upward component in the air's motion when the wind change at the surface took
place. The surface ESE. wind, which gradually turned to S. and SW. as the altitude
mcreased, gained considerably in speed as the storm approached.

FIG. 6.-Surface relative humidity changes (% ) at Drexel AerologlcaJ Station
during thunderstorm on June 21, 1916.

Explanation of the records.-The rise in pressUTe shown by the
barolP'aID. and the fall in temperatUTe shown by the thermo~ram are
simultaneous and occur at the time of the wind change above described, or, in the case of this storm, seven or eight minutes before
the first precipitation. 'l'he rise in humidity begins when the rain
begins. The height of the cloud base indicated in Figure 3 is about
1 kilometer (0.6 mile) above the earth's sUTface, that of the upper
sUlface of the cloud 1.5 to 2 kilometers (0.9 to 1.2 miles) higher.
At the time of the sudden change in pressure and temperature it
appears that the relatively cool and therefore dense WNW. wind
forced the warmer ESE. wind up from the earth's surface. Assuming that the surface air of this latter wind reached the cloud base
level by the time precipitation began, it would have an upward
component of 2 m. p. s. (4.5 mi. p. h.). The horizontal component
of the speed of this CUlTent of air as indicated in FigUTe 3 is about
eight times the supposed vertical component. These are ideal conditions for soaring flight, but a too near approach to the boundary
planes between the different currents in action here would be dangerous because of the great differences in wind speed and direction
that obtain.
Warning of thunderstorm's approach.-The aviator has in the case
of the storm just described a warning of from 20 to 25 minutes. It
would be unwise for him to get into the region of the abrupt wind
change. In this time he should either effect a landing or change his
course so as to go around the storm either to the right or left of it
or above it. The direction and rate of motion of storms of this type
are fairly well indicated by the winds in front of them and by the
appearance of the cloud.
Thunderstorm frequency . -While data on thunderstorm frequency
indicate that these storms occur more freqllently in certain regions of
the country than in others, it may be well to consider variations in
this frequency at a particular location. It has been shown above
that thunderstorms occur when a denser, usually colder, air mass
flows under and forces up a less dense, usually warmer, air mass.
In other words thunderstorms are most likely to occur at the boundary between a warm and a relatively cool air mass or at the breaking
up of a hot spell. In a followin~ chapter, in which the weather map
is discussed, it will be shown that the region of greatest thunderstorm frequency for a given location is to the south of a low-pressure
area. Thunderstorms are occasionally found to occur to the south

of high-pressure areas and less frequently in regions aside from these
two, where the topography or nature of the surface in combination
with local conditions gives rise to them, e. g., where the earth's surface is much broken by hills or mountains. On land, thunderstorms of the type above described have a diurnal maximum of
frequency. This maximum occurs just after the hottest part of the
day, or following 3 or 4 p. m. Thunderstorms are decidedly more
frequent in the summer than in the winter months .
Turbulent conditions indicated by thunderstorms .-Thunderstorms
may be occuning over a considerable area, thouo-h at the same time
no ono storm is of ve~-y great area and may possilJlY be avoided by a

.

pilot who has got well into the air. It is the turbulence of the air,
mdicated by the OCCUl'Tence of thunderstorms in the region, that is of
especial interest when the accessibility of a given field by aerial
routes is being considered.
Oyclonic thunderstorms and tornadoes.-There is another type of
thunderstorm which usually occurs within a heavily clouded or
rain area. In this type it is thought that the origin of the disturbance is in the cloud layer. There is a sharp drop in the surface pressure while this storm passes and an almost unmediate return to
pre-storm conditions. This type of storm is not nearly so cominon
and does not seem to have been so fully investigated as the type
ubove described. The wind action seems to be cyclonic, and the two
kinds of storms may well be designated "line" and "cyclonic."
It is quite concei,able that a thunderstorm of the cyclonic type
could also originate as a result of e..-.::cessive local heating, the area
heated being relatively small when the excess of heat is considered.
This origin is all the more probable when the heated area is near
the boundaries of passing aIr cmrents. Extremely severe cyclonio
thunder torms may develop very hi~h wind velocities and do great
damage specially on the right half 01 the storm's path. When they
have so developed, these storms are called tornadoes.
Tropical cyclones or hU1'ricanes.-These are, as a rule, storms of
larger aI'ea tban either thunderstorms or tornadoes. They seem to
have a similar origin, i. e., they occur on the boundary between air
masses of different densities and moving in opposite, or nearly opposite, directions. These storms are of a more permanent type than
either thunderstorms or tornadoes. They can, therefore, be foretold for a greater len~th of time (sometimes for several days) ahead
of their occurrence than can the shorter lived thunderstorms and
tornadoes.
Direction of tmveZ of distu1,bed condition.-Thundorstorms of the
line type seem to travel approximately at right angles to the line
between the two air masses of different density in which they originate and into the warmer air mass. Those of the cyclone type including tornadoes appear to travel with the general drift of the air
in the upper part of the stratum in which they occm. HUl'Ticanes
originate in the trade wind belt in the summer half of the year and
extend up into the anti trades. The anti trades seem largely to control the direction and rate of travel of these storms. Where the
direction and spoed of travel of storms is largely determined by the
direction and speed of an upper wind cUl'Tent, systematic observations
of this CUlTent by means of kites or free balloons aid greatly in predicting future positions of the storm at given times.

CURRENT METEOROLOGY AND ITS USE.

Ourrent meteorological observations.-While the selection of a site
for an aeronautio base station or training camp, in .0 far as it depends on meteorological conditions, can best bebased on the meteorological records of many stations for a period of 10 year , or longer if
possible, the best current use of the station must depend to a great
extent on the making and proper interpretation of current meteorological observations at and in the vicinity of the station. Free air
as well as surface observations are needed.
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS.

Weather reports andjorecasts.-Surface observations of air pressure,
temperature, humidity, movement, 'precipitation, cloudiness, sunshine, etc., are made by the Weather Bureau twice daily, and oftener
when found necessary, at more than 200 regular stations. These are
collected at the forecast centers by telegraph, mapped, and, together
with weather predictions based on them, are ready for distribution
within about two hours after observation time. It would be to the
advantage of every aeronautio station to receive these weather
reports and to make its own weather maps. The more the aviator
can see and understand of the weather map the better.
The simultaneous synoptic weather map is a convenient arrangement, on an outline map of the country, of the data observed at the
200 or more Weather Bureau stations. Figure 7 shows such a map.
The weather conditions portrayed on this map are sharpll defined,
boundaries of the characteristic weather regions b eing easIly distinO'uished. The most striking feature of the map is the system of solid
fines which become closed curves about the centor of the low-presstu:e
area in lower Michigan and about the center of high-pressure area in
northern Wyoming. These lines are called isobaJ.'S, because the
pressure, reckoned from the indications of mercurial barometers at
the different station , is the same at all points through which any
one line passes. The observing stations reporting are indicated by
small oircles. An arrow head attached to each circle indicates the
direction in which the wind is blowing. After allowing for local
peculiarities in wind direction, owing to topography or to the proximity of land and wat or sUl1accs, it appears that a northerly wind
prevails between the trough of low pressure to the east and the ridge
of high pressure to the west, and that a southerly wind prevails between the ridge of high pressure to the east ancI the trough of low

tions in the nature of the earth's surface, the pressure difference
between them increases with latitude. This map iUustrates well
p~ge~ 16.to 18 of Part 1, which deal with winds and related pressure
distl'1butlOn.
Dist1vibution oj air temperature and density.-The dotted lines on
the map are isotherms. -Note that one of these lines, the one indicating the location of freezing temperatme, as it passes from the
southerly to the northerly cmrent, i. e., through the minimum of air
pressme, tmns sharply to the south. It begins to move toward
higher latitudes as it approaches the maximum of air pressme. The
indications of the temperatme ob ervations are that the air of the
southerly cmrent is warm for the season, while that of the northerly
current IS cold. There is a tendency in these cml'ents to move down
the pressure slopes, i . e., to flow from regions of higher to regions of
lower pre sme, and thus to meet more or less directJy on their left
sides. At this meeting the colder air, being the denser, continues on
the earth's surface and forces the warmer air to rise over it. Another
condition contributing to the rising of tho warm air in the southerly
current i that part of it, in approaching the center of low pressure
on its front, converges somewhat. This convergence tends to force
the asoent of some of the air in that part of the current. In these
larger disturbances the rates of vertical motion are very slow compared with those which occm in thunderstorms. By observation; in
an extreme case, the area of the base of an air column was founa. to
decrease to about three-fomths of itself in about four hours. Assuming this convergence to occur to a depth of 1 mile, the greate t

Rscensional rate that could OCCUl' ill, any part of the air mass on
account of this convergence would be less than 2.25 meters per minute
(7~ feet per minute) .
The rain area of the Zow.-A oareful study of the air circulation in
the vicinity of an area of low press me indicates that the air of the
southerly omrent is deflected most toward the pressme minimum
and converges most in front and to the north of the center of low
pre sme, and that the air of the northerly cmrent is deflected most
and spreads out over the earth's surface to the south of this line.
Since precipitation results cfu'ectly from the ascent of the relatively
warm moist air of the southerly cmrent, these two factors operate
to place the center of the precipitation area in the front, possibly a
little to the south, of the center of low pressme. Almost any weather
map in which a well-formed low is illustrated will show the rain
area centered jn the front half of the low.
Other rain areas.-There i , as a rule, but little mixing of the
northerly and southerly cmrents across the ridge of hi&h pressmo.
Mixing may occm here, because of the deflecting action ot the earth's
rotation and in spite of the opposing pressure gradients. When it
does, small precipitation areas may be found to the northeast or to
the south of the center of high preSSUl'e, where the warmer moister
air of the southerly wind has risen over the colder air of the northerly.
Motion of low and high pressure areas.-Those low and high pressme areas travel from west to east across the country with about the
speed and direction of the wind at a height of 3 to 5 kilometers
(2 to 3 miles). A suggested explanation of the way in which this
movement is brought about is given in Part 1, pp. 18 and 19.
The winds which seem to control the storm movement have a wide
range of speeds, averaging about 11 meters per second (25 miles per
hom). Most 10w-pressUl'e areas enter om country from the northwest, a few come from the southwest, and others enter at some
point along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Practically all lows
leave the country at the northeast. TIus exit is appIOached by many
routes, but ill, general by way of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence,
by way of the Ohio River Valley, or by way of the Gulf and Atlantic
coasts. The motion of the area across the country brings to the
places traversed the different types of weather indicated for each
area. H one had a typical low-pressme area and a typical high:r>reSSUl'e urea charted on transpa.r ent paper, One could, by moving
them over the map from west to ea t, follow the wind and weather
changes ocomri~ at any particular city or place for the path taken
by the low or high. 1 An easterly wind, cirrus clouds followed by
lower clouds, precipitation, and, as the wind ohanges to northwest
by way of north, clearing and cooler weather, are in general the
order of wind and weather change one would experience if the center
of the low-pressme area passed to the south of him. Similarly these
changes may be followed for any position with reference to the
oenter of either a pa ing high or low :r>ressme area. The rules
printed on tho daily weather map are as follows:
When the wind sets in from points between south and southeast and the barometer
falls steadily a storm is approaching from the west or northwest, and i ts center will

pass near or north of the observer within 12 to 24 hours, with wind shifting to northwest by way of southwest and west. When the wind sets in from points between
the east and northeast and the barometer falls steadily a storm is approaching from
the BOuth or southwest, and its center will pass near or to the BOuth or east of the
observer within 12 to 24 hours, with wind shifting to northwest by way of north. The
rapidity of the storm's approach and its intensity will be indicated by the rate and
the amount of the fall in the barometer.

Oharacter and intensity of highs and Zows.-These areas may vary
in character and in intensity during their journey across the country.
It is clear that this must be the case. In the case of a low-pressure
area, for example, the temperature and moistl.U·e content of the
southerly wind entering the low on its front is to a large extent
determined by topography and other characteristics of the surface
over which it blows. The difference in temperature between the
southerly wind in front and the northerly wind ill the rear of the lowpressure area is to some extent a measure of the activity about the
center of low pressure, while the size and position of the precipitation
area, as well as the amount of precipitatIOn in any part of the area.,
depend largely on the moisture content of the southerly wind. One
who would predict the weather conditions for a given place needs to
consider these variations in character and intensity, as well as the
direction and speed of travel of the high or low pressure area.
Seasonal changes in the highs and lows.-The weather conditions
accompanyinO' high and low pressure areas vary with the seasons as
well as with the varying nature and topography of the earth's surface
over which they tmv~l, but all these phenomena are dependent on
the fact that the centers of these areas are located on the boundary
between a warmer and a colder northerly current of air.
The thunderstorm region.-A north and south line through the
center of a low-pressure area lies approximately in the boundary
between the warm air mass to the east and the cooler air mass to the
west of it. It is in such a region that thunderstorms and tornadoes
are most likely to occur in the summer months. Temperature and
other conditions most suitable for the development of these local
storms are found to the south of the center of the low-pressure area.
There is much more likelihood of the cold and warm air mixing, and
therefore of thunderstorms, in the south half of the trough of low
pressure than in the corresponding region of the ridge of high pressure. This is because the air tends to flow in the direction of decreasing pressure. CertainlaJ:ts of the country are seldom traversed
by low-pressl.U·e areas an seldom, therefore, exp~ence thunderstorms or tornadoes while in other regions these more local storms
are quite frequent. Bad flying conditions are likely to be experienced
in tile region of turbulence to the south of a low-pressure area, especially in the summer half of the year.
Intensity of disturbances and direction of motion.-It may be readily
inferred from the foregoing discussion that, independent of the
nature and topography of the surface over which it travels, the intensity of a distmbance, whether about a center of high or of low pressure,
varies with the direction of its travel. When the center of the area
moves south in the Northern Hemisphere the action about it is
likely to decrease in intensity, because 2pw V sin ).. and consequently
2pw V sin).. decreases with latitude and vice versa. (See Part 1,
g
p. 17.)

UPPER. AIR OBSERVATION.

J

The value of upper-air observations.-The aviator is concerned as
well with laying his course between two points as with the location
and current use of his station. This involves a knowled~ of what
is going on above as well as near the earth's surface. While in a
general way it is possible to predict upper-air conditions from the
surface data as shown on the weather map, observations of these
conditions can be so conveniently and so quickly made that every
aeronautic base station should be equipped WIth apparatus and
personnel for making them. Some consideration of the relations
existin~)etween upper and lower atmospheric conditions within the
first 5 .lrilometers will be of value in this connection.
Pressure distribution and height.-Referring again to Figure 7, it
is probable that at a height of about 3 kilometers in the atmosphere
above that map the isobars are no longer closed as they are about
the centers of high and of low pressure at sea level. The transition
with height from the closed isobars to the a'pproximately parallel
and east-west lines is a gradual one, the closed lsobars opening on the
left, usually north, side of the low pressure area and on the right side
of the high. The best indication of this change in the character of
pressure distribution with height is found in the observations of air
movement.
Winds and pressure distribution.-When free to do so, the air moves
approximately at right angles to the direction in which the pressure
gradient acts- that IS, in equilibrium with the force of gravity which
tends to make this flow directly down along the pressure gradient and
the deflective force of the earth's rotation. The friction between the
air and the earth's surface or between two or more strata of air tends
to decrease its rate of movement, V, and to that extent determines
the value of 2pw V sin A. As a result of the decrease in this value the
gravitational flow of the air in the lower part of the larger current
(down the pressure slope established by the influence of the earth's
rotation on this larger current) becomes relatively prominent.
Wind change with height in lows.-With these relations in mind a
study of Figures 8 to 19 will indicate in a general way what wind
direction may be expected at any height above a given configuration
of the sea-level isobars. In each figure the large arrow shows the
sea-level direction of travel of the disturbance; the small arrows show
wind direction. These figures are based on means of five years'
obseI"Vations of the winds at different heights above Mount Weather)
Va. In Figure 8, the mean angle between the small arrows and the
tangents of the circular isobars is 44°. In Figure 9 this mean angle
is 33°. The radial component of wind directIOn outward from the
center of the high pressure is, relative to the component along the
isobars, greater than the radial component of wind inward toward
the center of the low. The sense in which the wind changes direction
with height and the extent of the change may be followed by examining the wind directions at the different levels. As a rule the red
arrows in octants 1, 2, 7, 8 of the low-pressure areas swing about their
points in a clockwise direction as one ascends vertically to higher
levels; i. e., the wind in these octants veers with height. In octants
3,4,5,6 tho arrows of the low-pressure area for the most part swing in
a cOtmtcrclockwise direction with altitude: i. e., the wind in these

octants backs with height. The extent of this veering or backing
with height seems to depend largely on how far the surface wind
differs from a west wind, since this is the prevailing direction at the
5-kilometer level and above. The dividing line, to one side of which
the wind veers with height and to the other side of which the wind
backs with height, is the line from the center of the low out along which
the isobars open with height. Whether or not this line is the exact
boundary between the second and third octants depends on the prevailing wind at the higher levels and also on other conditions which it
has been shown influence to some extent the direction of travel of the
low-pressure area.
Wind change with height in highs.-A similar change in wind direction with height occurs in the high-press me area, except that in the
high the isobars open with height on the right side or on a line roughly
comcident with the boundary between the sixth and seventh octants.
The backing with height occurs in octants 7, 8, 1, and 2, and the veering with height occurs in octants 3, 4, 5, and 6.
General laws of wind change with height.-Considering the turning of
the wind with height independently of the pressme distribution, the
relations shown in Table I are found to obtain. Table II shows that
at 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) above sea level practically all winds are
from directions to the west of north or south. At twice this height
west winds begin to prevail decidedly.

Wind speed and height.-A general idea of how the wind speed increases with hci~ht is given by Table Ill. In
most cases the increase in wind speed is fairly rapid up to the 1 or 1i kilometer (1 Illile) level. Above the 1.5 kilometer (1 mile) level the increase in wind speed is more gradual.

TURBULENCE, ETC.

Effect oj obstructions on wind.-The character of the wind with
respect to gustiness also varies with height. The height to which
~ustiness, arising from variations in level of the earth's surface, trees,
buildings, and such obstructions, occurs, depends on the abruptnes
and extent of the change in level and on the wind speed and direction.
Over a plain where the changes in level are owing largely to buildings
and trees, this kind of gustiness has probably largely disappeared
at a height of 50 to 75 met{'rs. Over rolling country, over more
broken hilly surface, and over mountainous re~ions , the atmospheric
disturbances caused by the irregularities of the earth's surface extend to greater and greater heights. Limited experience in the exploration of these topographic effects in the atmosJ>here indicates
that they may extend above the general ground level to more than
three times the height of the hill or mountain causing them.
TU1'bulence due to insolation.-Turbulence of the lower air resulting
from insolation and the variation from place to place of the nature
of the earth's surface, its ability to absorb or reHect solar radiation
being considered, extends to heights varying with the hour of the
day and with the season. On a clear summer day this turbulence
may reach a height of 2 kilometers (1 t miles); on a clear winter day
1.5 kilometers, or a little less than 1 mile. The temperature distribution in clear weather and at different hei
throughout the
24 hours, Figures 20 and 21, indicates these TI. 'ts ~uite clearly.
The afternoon maximum. of temperature, which owes Its existence
to the heating of the earth's surface and the accompanying atmospheric turbulence in the lower strata at this time, disappears between
the 1.5 and 2 kilometer levels in the summer monthS, and between
the 1 and 1.5 kilometer levels in the winter months. Figures 20
and 21 are based on data obtained in one year's observations at
Mount Weather. These data are more fully discussed in the Bulletin of the MOWlt Weather Ob ervatory volwne 6, part 5.
Flying levels and tU1'bulence.-It is probable that an airplane flying
at the heights indicated above would not encounter turbulence or
"roughness" of air of the types under consideration. It may be
added that many storms, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones of the temperate r egions may be safely passed
o,er at a height of 3 kilometers (2 miles). Most of these storms
occur entirely below the 5 kilometer (3 mile) level.

change with height is more rapid in this region of the atmosphere,
espeCially in the first few hundred meters than in the winter. Inversions of temperature are infrequent and of more or less accidental
types. The condition of equilibrium is therefore less stable in the
summer than in the winter months, and turbulence is more likely to
occur.
