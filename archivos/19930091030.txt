RELATIVE WORTH OF IMPROVEMENTS ON FABRICS.
By

THE GOODYEAR TIRE AND RUBBER CO.

If one seeks to determine the qualities which offer the best chance
for improvement, without knowing as yet the exact means for effecting
such improvement, the procedure is as follows:
Assume that in a theoretically perfect fabric each of the following
qualities would be reduced to zero:
Weight (per unit strength) .
Diffusion.
Rate of depreciation (dollars per year).
Heating coefficient.
In terest and insurance.
Moisture absorption.
It may be admitted that, in practice, certain of the above qualities
can not possibly be reduced below the well-recognized minimum of
terrestrial materials, but this minimum is in every case so near zero,
compared to the figures for ordinary balloon fabnc, that the point is
of no practical importance.
Applying the results to a dirigible and taking the items one at a
time: If tlie weight of fabric is reduced to the assumed minimum it
will save ; of the total running expense of the dirigible; where W is
the total weight of fabric saved and D is the useful load carried.
If diffusion is entirely eliminated it will save the entire cost of gas
(including labor and overhead) except that which escapes through
the valves, the interest on the original inflation, and liability to accidental deflation.
If the fabric is made infinitely durable it will save all the depreciation of the gas bag except that due to accidental injury.
If the heating coefficient is reduced to zero it will save the running
expense of that part of the control system which serves to correct the
effects of heating, plus w' of the total running expense of the diriu
gible; where w' is the weight of app'aratus saved.
If cost is entirely eliminated it WIll save the interest and insurance
on the fabric (exclusive of building up).
If the moisture absorption is reduced to zoro, it will save the cost
wI!

of apparatus to correct it, plus - of the total running expense of the
u
dirigible, where wI! is the weight of apparatus saved.

AERONAUTICS.

Asswne now a modern nonrigid dirigible of 500,000 cubic feet
capacity and speed of 40 miles per hour. Other data could be reason6-bly expected as follows:
W= weight of fabric = 5,000 pounds.
U = aver~ge useful load = 6,000 pounds.
10,000 miles per year.
Gross running expense, $100,000 per year.
Gas leakage, 0.5 per cent per day.
R einflation every three months.
Gas and inflation cost at $0.01 per cubic foot (plus allowance
of $10,000 for idle time), MO,OOO pOl' year.
Depreciation of gas bag (fr om weathering and ordinary wear),
$20,000 per year.
w' = weight of heat-control apparatus (planes, fuel, and ballast), 1,200 pounds.
Interest and insurance (military) on fabric, $15,000 per year.
wI! = weight of apparatus to counteract moisture absorption
(planes and ballast), 500 pounds.
The above data works into th e following figures which show the
gross expen e chargeable to each of th e items named:
Per year.

Weight ______ - __ ______ ______ __ _______ __ __ ___________ ____ ____ $82,000
Diffusion ____ _______ . ________________________________________ 40, 000

Interest and insurance ________________________________________ 15,000
Moisture absorbtion __ ------ - - - _- _- _- _________________________ 8,000

(These figures are of course largely overlapping and can not be
summed up into a total. )
Expre sed on a percentage basis for tho various qualities sought for,
we get roughly the following:
Quality:

For proportional improvement it will be seen that lightness is by
far the most desirable quality, while mere cheapness of fabric 18
almost the last thing to be sought.
The table also furnishes means of determining whether a proposed
change in the design of a fabric is worth while.
In effecting a certain improvement other qualities are generally
affected at the same time, sometimes adversely. To determine the
degree of not improvement multiply the per cen t improvemen t in each
quality by its qu ality gauge number, and add up the products. If
the result is I?osltive a net improvement has b een effeoted proportional
to the magmtude of the figure. For instance a 5 per cent saving in
weight woUld he worth wliile even if accompanied by a 20 per cent
increase in cost, other things remaining the same.
It should be carefully noted that this p articular scale of improvements is strictly applicable only to a ship of approximately the characteristic ahove n amed, and to that only under certain fixed condi-

tions of operation. It is only taken as a rough guide to present day
dirigibles III general. Whenever the fabric, the dirigible or its conditions of use are much changed, the fabric improvement scale must
be changed accordingly.
It h as been argued by some that the economic basis of design can
not be applied at all to military work. With this I decidedly do not
agree. It is true only to the extent that certain items of cost such
as initial investment are often of small, sometimes negligible, importance compared with other items. But if the analysis IS complete,
It may be put squarely on an economic b asis, it being only necessary
to estimate the t1'ue saving for each of the possible improvements
above nam ed, applied to the particular requirem ents and conditions
governing the case in hand.
It is evident from what has been said that for a dirigible of certain
required specifications a definite equation exists connecting all the
major qualities of the fabric, from which the fabric m ay be rigidly designed with respect to maximum ultimate economy.
The same prmciples apply to balloons and aeroplanes. For an
80,000 cubic root spherical balloon (the Goodyear), the following order
prevails if used for p assenger flights (1 d ay trips) .
