This report describes a method developed at-the Bureau of Standards for measuring the
total energy liberated as heat in a spark gap by an ignition system. Since this heat energy
is obtained from the electrcmmgnetic energy “stored in the windings of the magneto or coil,
it is a measure of the effectiveness of the device as an electric generator. It must be borne in
mind, however, that- this total energy is by no means a measure of the igniting power of the
spark.
Use is made of a hollow block of copper and the sparks to be measured are passed between
nickel alloy terminals in a cavity-in the interior of the block. The heat-liberated raises the
temperature of the chamber and this temperature rise is measured by a copper-constantan
thermocouple and a galvanometers. The apparatus is calibrated by sending a known current
through a heating coil inclosed in the cavity. Measurements reliable to 5 per cent -can be
obtained in about 15 minutes as the apparatus is usually operated. The runs can be shortened
to five minutes with some sacriiice of accuracy. A gap length 2.1 mm. (0.082 inch) between
terminals 1.5 mm. (0.06 inch) in diameter is used, as this makes the breakdown voltage and
duration of the spark substantially- the equivalent of that occurring in an aviation engine
cylinder.
INTRODUCI’ION.
The method for the measurement of energy dissipated in ignition sparks which is described
in this report was developed at the Bureau of Standards as a part of the ignition investigation.
It is recognized that this total heat energy is by no means a measure of the igniting power of
a spark, since the “latter is affechd by many other factors. The value of this measure as an
indicator of magneto performance arises from the fact that the energy which is liberated in
the spark gap i: derived from the ele@ro-magnetic energy stored fi” the magneto or coil, and
the amount of this energy is to that extent a measure of the effectiveness of the apparatus
as an electric gaierator.
Calorimetric methods for measuring this energy have the advantages of greater simplicity
and freedom from the many sources of error which are liable to enter into purely electrical
methods of measuring power under the extreme conditions of high voltage and distorted wave
forms which occur in ignition circuits,, The use of a copper block form of calorimeter avoids
the inconvenience of liquid calorimeters and has been found very satisfactory for this as well
as many other lines of work. In common with other calorimeter measurements, the results
can be conveniently expressed in absolute units and may therefore be compared with results
obtained by other obse~vers with different. r.nethods.

DESCRIPTION APPARATUS.
OF
The calorimeter itself consists of a hollow copper block, as shown in figure 1, approximately
3.5 cm. (1.4 inches) in diameter and 5.5 cm. (2.z inches) long, containing a cavity in the
center. The spark to be measured OCCUIIS
between the grounded electrode C and a high
potential electrode B, the latter being insulated from the chambw by a small glass bushing.
These electrodes are fitted with nickel alloy terminals 1.5 mm. (0.06 inch) in diameter, for
most work set to give a spark gap of 2.1 mm. (0.082 inch). This gap may be varied, if
desired, by the micrometi adjustment of the grounded terminal.
The effect of external temperature chtiges is compensated for by the use of a dummy
copper block, E (@re 2), which is similar to the workbgdcmimda
c
butmnt~ins
nosp~r~
gap; and is placed symmetrically with respect to the working chamber inside of a double-vvallcd
wooden box. This box is lined with sheet copper in order to insure uniform temperature
over its entire surface. A copper-constantan thermocouple has one junction im?.wdded in
each of the blocks and by-means of a Leeds & Northrup type 2,400 galvanometers serves to
indicate the dif!%rencein temperature between the two blocks. The absolute temperature of
either block is immaterial and is not measured. The galvanometar which has a sensitivity
of 5 microvolt per division and a resistance of 190 ohms has been found very satisfactory for
this purpose.
METHODSOF USE.
Starting with the two blocka at the same temperature the spark is passed in block A for two
minutes and the magneti is then stopped for one minute to alIow the temperatures to equalize.
At the end of this third minute, the galvanometers is read and the magneto again started for
another period of two minutes continuous run. This process is continued until five or six
readings have been obtained. These galvanometers deflections are then plotted against time,
giving a curve stillar to the ones shown in plot 4. This curve is then superposed on the set
of sirdar curves obtained at the original calibration of the “instrument, and of which plot
3 is an example, and the average watti corresponding to the observed curves are read ofl directly.
The heat energy per spark is then computed from the formula
joules per spark =

watts X60
sparks per rev. x r. p. m.

Before starting a second measurement, it is necessary to COO1
the chamber ~ to the
temperature of the block l?, but this is quite easily done by moistening it with alcohol and
allowing this to evaporate.
The advantage: of this somewhat complex s&wn &e that a n&bar of gaIvanomctcr
readings are obtained so that the results are not vitiaied by a single error in reading, and the
pauses bet ween runs ensure that the temperatures are fairly equalized throughout the block.
The time for the entire run is approximately 15 minutes. k cases where the cibipation of
power is in excess of five watts, it is more convenient to use a cycle consisting of one minute
running and one minute equalization.
It is, of course, possible to make a single continuous run of 5 or 10 minutae’ duration and
take a single galvanometers reading at the end of that time, and accuracy of 10 pcr cent or
better can be obtained with such a procedure, It is a~so probable that apparatus of this
general type might be constructed with mercury thermometers instead of a thermocouple
and thereby avoid the necessity of using a sensitive galvanometers.
CALIBRATION.
The calorimeter is calibrated by the use of a coil of resistance wire, which is shown in
figure 1. A known amount of enery is dissipated in this coil using the same cycle of operation
as is done in measuring the spark energy and the curves of galvanomet.er deflection against
time are plotted as in plots 3 and 4. Since the heat is added at the same rate as in tho actual
operation, this method of calibration eliminates any error due to 10SS of heat from the
calorimeter. The calorimeter has approximately a heat capacity equal to that of 40 grams
of water, so that the temperature rise corresponding to 1,000
joulessabout 6° C!.

SOURCES ERROR.
OF
As mentioned above, the heat losses from the calorimeter are compensated for by the use
of the dummy chamber and the method of calibration. Another possible source of error is
conduction of heat through the high-tension lead which i: thermally insulated from the block
by the glms bushing. ~is has been investigated by making use of the fact that-if “sparks
of the same polarity are repeatedly passed through a gap, one electrode becomes much hotter
than the other. Measurements were made on a system giving this constant polarity, both
with the high-tension electrode as anode and later as a cathode, and no difference in average
energy was detected. This indicates that the heat loss through the high-tension lead, even
when t-hehigh-tension terminal is much hotter than it becomes with alternating sparks, causes
no appreciable’ error.
The passage of the spark through the air causes a formation of oxides of nitrogen and
nitric acid in the chamber which have some tendency to corrode the interior., Computations,
however, show that the energy involved in these chemical reactions is entirely negligible in
comparison with the’ heat, energy dissipated. The change in volume of the gas, due to this
chemical “reaction, does “not enter into the measurements with this apparatus as it does when
an air thermometer is used.
The standard length of gap 2.1 mm, (0.082 inch) was chosen for this work because measurements with a crest voltmeter showed it to have the same breakdown voltage as that of an
average spark plug in a high-compression engine cylinder. What is still more important, the
voltage drop across the terminals while the spark continues to pass is also substantiality the same
as that occurring in an engine. This sustaining voltage is th-e principal factor in determining
the rate of dissipation of energy and, consequently, the duration of the spark. Since the voltagea above,mentioned were ~easured w,ith the gap in continuous operation, they include the
effect of any accumulated ionization in the chamber, and therefore the fact that the gap is not
ventilated is n!ot an objection, but is, indeed, essential to the measurements for only under
these conditions are the initial and sustaining voltages of the calorimeter gap the same as
those obtaining in the average aviation engine.
It is believed that the results obtained with this apparatus and procedur6 may be relied
upon to 5 per cent, and after the apparatus is once calibrated a determination can be made in
about 15 minutes.
TYPICAL
RESULTS.
Plot- 5 gives a typical curve of the results obtained “by this method on a shuttle core
magneto at different speeds. The particular curve shown represents the performance of a
Bosch Type Z-H-6 taken from a captured German airplane, and is quite-similar to other highgrade magnetos. Battery systems usually give less heat, ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 joules
per spark.

are of value both as a general index of the power of_each machine for comparative purposes
and also as a basis for the more oomplete study of the effects of various features in design upon
the delivered energy of &ma=weto.
Regular runs were made on 15 magnetos and one battery system for total anergy output,
the energy being measured on a specially constructed calorimeter described in a later paragraph.
Observations were taken on the magnetos at speeds up to 3,5oo revolutions per minute. Preliminary measuzemente have dso been carried out to determine the effect of spark length and
other variables on the total energy,
METHOD.
The calorimeter used is fullv described in Par&I of this report and consists chiefly of two
hollow copper bombs of appro~mately the same shape and volume, suspended by means of
hard rubber posts im a dead-air space. The spark is made to pass between nickel aUoy spark
points in the interior of one bomb and the rate of rise of temperature of this bomb over tho
other is measured by means of a thermocouple and galvanometers. Previous calibration with
a known heater resistance and direct current provides means for dete mining the constant of
the apparatus.
In the regular rune a standard spark length of 2.1 mm. (0.082 inch) between flat surfacea
1.5 mm. (0.059 inch) in diameter was used. ThiB gap was chosen because it was fotmd by
measurement to ha-re the same breakdown voltage (about- 6,000 volts) as that of a 0.5 mm.
(O.O2O
inch) gap between spark-plug electrodes in a l&h-compression aviation engge. I?nrthermore the voltage required to sustain the arc across these electrodes is approximately the same
as that of an operating_ylug. Consequently the rate of dissipation of energy and the duration
of the spark are sub.%ntidly the same as in act,ual practice. A more detaikd description of
this method is given in J?ari 1’of this report.
REGULAR

RUNS.

The principal features of each of the systems tasted are tabulated in Table 1, and the
observed values of heat energy are plotted again..t maggeto-driving shaft speed in plots 1 to
16, inclusive. Where the magnetos were provided with variable spark position, the messuremente were made at full advance. The data from these plote are summarized in TabIe II.
Column 111 gives the average joules per spark over the range from 500 to 2,500 revolutions
per minute of the ma=~et.os; coiumn IV gives the maximum joules per spark, and column V
the speed at which this maximum occurs; column VI gives the joules per spark at the speed
required for operating at 1,5oOrevolutions per minute a 4-cycle engine of the number of cylindem
for which the magneto is designed; column VII gives the joules per spark at the speed at which
the system is delivering 100 sparks per second.

Itwill be noticed that all the curves, with the exception of the Liberty battery and coil
ignition set, have the the same gener~ Chmactwistic shape) rishg rapidly to a maximum value
at some low speed—generally between 750 and 1,000 revolutions per minute-thm
slowly
decreasing toward higher_speeds. In practically every case a peculiar bend in the curve, which
is shown very markedly in plot 1, is evident.
The energy curve of the Liberty coil (plot 14) starts with its highest value at a very low
speed and remains constant up to about 140 revolutions per minute. At higher speeds the
primary current does not have time b build Up to its maximum value, which causes a decrease
in total energy as the speed is increased, In order h-give a better comparison the coil system
curve is replotted ss a dotted line to-correspond to the speed of rotation of a four-spark magneto.
(The coil as operated gave 12 sparks per revolution.)
SPECIALRUNS.
Several different rum were made on ~ypicsJ yagnetos to determine the effect of (a) type
of distributor; (b) condenser added h primary c~cult; (c) lmge number of secondary turns;
(d) length of spark gap; (e) added secondary capacity.

ANNUAL

REPORT NATIONAL

ADVISORY CKMMITTEE

FOR AERONAUTIC%.

(a) A D-81 Berling magneto with demounfiable distributors was used to determine the
effect of the jump-spark distributor as compared to the brush; plots 7 and 6 show the total
heat curves of this magneto with the two types of distributor, respectively. Although tha
general shape of the two curves is the same, the energy obtained with the jump-spark distributor is aboutr10 per cent less than that obtained with the brush over the whole range.
(h) It is not definitely known whether the depressions occurring in all the curves are of
electrical or mechanical origin, Plot 4 shows a tiery interesting point that was brought
out on the curve for S. E. V. No, 1. A 0~5 microfirad paraffined paper condenser was put
across the primary breker in parallel with the original condenser of about 0.2 microfarad
in the magneto. This additional capacity did not abr the running condition se far as sparking at the breaker points was concerned, but the whole curve of heat energy, together with
tbe position of the depressicm, was moved toward the origin by a definita amount. It should
be noted that none of the maximum or minimum points in the curves was raised or lowered.
(c) Plot 3, which shows the energy curve for a two-spark-per-revolut.ion Bcrksbire
ma=-eto of the inductor type, is also of “hterest. T%ia machine gives four flux reversals pcr
revolution, but the primary breaker cam is so..arranged that only two breaks are made per
revolution, and, therefore, but two of the flux reversals are used. This magmto is wound
with a very large number of secondary turns: and it was found that beyond 2,500 revolutions
per minute, due to the large voltage of rotation generated in the secondary winding, four
sparka occur per revolution. By leaving the primary circuit open, four sparks per revolution
were obtained at all speeds above 2,500 revolutions per minute. This accounts for tho apparently increased heat per spark obtained at- the higher speeds. The Dixie 12-cylinder and the
Heinze 12-cylinder ma=getos also generated sufficient rotation voh.ge to break down a 5-millimeter (0.2 inch) spark gap in air.
(d) Plot 17 shows the eflect of increasing the calorimeter spark gap. Them runs were
made using a type D-6 Dual Bosch ma=gneto, fhing all pointa through the distributor. The
readings were taken at a constant speed of 800 revolutions per minute. The heat per spfirk
increases in value up to a 1.2-millimeter gap, beyond which it stays practically constant. The
slope of the curve toward zero is probably due to the fact that with small gaps the suetainhg
voltage is low, the duration of the spark is correspondingly long, and the cIosing of the breaker
quenches the spark before the full arnounti of available energy has been expended. Thd average
secondary current also is larger with a short gap, and, therefore, the 12R lose is greater and
the spark energy less,
Plote 10 and 13 show the effect of the length of cam (i. e., the angle during which tho
primary breaker is heId open). IrI plot 13 the breaker closes before the spark has had time
to dissipate all the availa.ble energy. This both decreases the fraction of tho total stored
energy which is Iiberated in the gap and also interferes with the building up of current for
the next spark, so that the available energy is also reduced. In plot 10 a simjk magneto
with longer cams, which prevent this interference, shows nearly 50 per cenb greahr spark
energy.
Several runs were made at constant speed on the 130ich D-6 magneto, with a condenser
of 0.0017 and 0.0034 microfa.nd capacity placed across the calorimeter gap. It was found
that this caused no appreciable change in the total energy of the spark, but the discharge was
changed from a more or 1sss flaming arc to a snappy white spark.
