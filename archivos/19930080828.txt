:g'ORMULA. OF THE STEADINESS FACTOR IN ENGINE SETS.

In a paper * liOn t.te Flywheel Eff e cto of Aviatio:"! Engines, If
1!l. Lecor::lu points out tha t tr.e usual method of determin:·u .g the steadiness factor cannot be applied to Gvi~tion engines coupled to & propeller because, in this case, the resisting tor~ue is a function of
the angul&r speed of rotation, ~nd n ot of the angle of r otation of
the cranksha.ft.

For engine sets, the

§ Z. - REDUCED MASS OF PARTS IN .OTION OF AVIATION ENGINES.
(1)

In the equation of motion/ ~ . Lec ornu has n~allowed f or the
mass of the parts in moti on of the engine itself, such as pistons,
conne ct~ng rods and crankshaft, whose mcments of inertia cannot be
ignored. Nor has he t~en i~to acc o~t the variation of the brake
torque as function of ~he variatio~ of the angul~r speed of rotation,
nor of the resisting torque of the engine itself. *
If the reduced mass of the engine parts in motion (that is, the
mass of the parts reduced t c a peint distant fran t h e axis of t he engine by the ~it of length) were c onstant, the equation of moti on
would be:
