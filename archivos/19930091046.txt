Mathematical theory has not, as yet, been applied to the discontinuous motion past a cambered surface, using the term cambered
as g~nerully und~rstood in aeronautics. For this rea on, we are
able'to desJgn aOl'ofoils only by consideration of those forms which
have hern succcssful, by applying general rules lenrned hy experience,
and by then wsting the aerofoils III a reliable wind tunnel. A great
milny Ilerofoils have from time to time been tested and from them
wo know gencrul rules which must be observed concerning camber
~md tho variations of camber on the upper and lower surfaces, if we
are to expect i.o attain even fair results. Results. better than the
ordinary are only attained when these general rules are observed,
and patience aud good for tunc are combllled. There are equations
of curves which aro very much like some aerofoils but they are not
deduced from mathematical knowledge of the flow past an aerofoil
but rather from the knowledge of the shape of these curves, and a
good idoa of the shape of a satisfactory nerofoil. It seems possible
that eventually "we shall know mathematicalll the best form for
speed and climb, but the practicalapplieation 0 this knowledge may
be more difficult than the present method of designing.

OBJEC T OF THE TEST.

Althou gh a great many aerofoi]s have been tested, many
less from a practic al point of view. It seems safe to assert are usethat
this countr y nearly every aorofoil used is eithor one of tho best in
fivo
or six tested by M. Eiftel near Paris or by the Nation al Physic
al
Labora tory at Teddin gton, En~]ftnd, or based upon them, with
some slight modifications. As ,nIl be seen from the results of theso
tests appare ntly slight variati ons may make considerable differen
ces.
We are thus limited to a few aerofoils, and some of these lack
certain desirable charac teristi cs as to the depth of wing
bined with a.erodynamical efficiency. It woUld seem of spars comadvant age
to have the following results of the tests made upon the
turally excelle nt and h retofor e aerody namica lly unkno wnSL,{ strucaerofoils
designed by the Aviati on Section, Signal Corps, United States Army.
This constIt utes the largest singlo group of aorofoils, except ing those
of the N. P. L . and M. Riffel, which. has been tested and publish ed.

U . S. A . 1 is a modification of tho Clark aerofoil to receive a deeper
rear spar. It was designed to be a good high-sp eed wing, with a good
~, having at the same time sufficient rear spar depth.
Depth of front spar = 0.0584 chord.
Depth of rear spar = 0.0497 chord.
U. S. A. 2 is a combin ation of the good charac teristic s
R. A. F . 3 and R. A. F . 6. It is an aorofoil desicyned for use of both

DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS.

The results in no way contradict any of the known general principles
regarclinO' the effects of changing variations in the camber of aerofoils. There are rules for determining the relative value of differen.t
wing sections. The lift-drift ratio, which is a measure of the efficiency of an aerofoil, gives information flS to the value of the wing.
The qualities desired in a good aerofoil n.re high speed, or low resistance, great climbing ability, and excellent weIght carrying capacity.
lllY one of these characteristics may be secured, but only at the
expense of the other two to a certain extent. In a pursuit machine,
where compromises are made to secure both hi~h speed and excellent
climbing ability, weight carrying is sacrificed. In a bombing machine
weight carrying ability is desired to the partial sacrifice of speed and
climb. In a training machine all three characteristics are desired,
but in moderation. A machine designed for high speed alone has
only n.limited practical application.
It is generally conceded that there is no "best" aerofoil, for all
have different characteristics and perform different functions. The
selection of a desirable section depends on the performance required
of the airplane desired.
AU of the U. S. A. aerofoils have the fundamental quality of being
structurally sound, permitting the use of sufficiently deep wing spars.
As su~gested in Mr. Alexander Klemin's "Course in AeronautIcs,"
the U . b . A. aerofoils are considered under the following headings:
(a) The maximum value of ~, the angle at which it occurs, and
the corresponding K;,.-The reason for this comparison is that an airplane in normal horizontal flight win generally be navigated at the
angle giving the best ~ ratio, which is therefore important. from an
efficiency point of view. The value of the lift coefficient at the best
~ ratio is important because the greater the lift at this ratio the
smaller the area of the wing surface required for the load. With
a heavy machine a big lift coefficient is desirable. With a pursuit
or racing machine a good ~ at small angles is desirable, so that with
a sufficiently powerful motor a grel1t speed may be obtained.
(b) The maximum 14, the angle at which it occurs, and the

corresponding ~ ratio. -The maximum I4 is a very important
charn.cteristic. The greater the maximum K;, the slower is the
speed at which a machine may fly and land. If large values of K1I
are accompanied by good ~ ratios, then the machine will be efficient
in climbing, though the best angle of climb is by no means at that
of the maximum K 1I • If the maximum K;, occurs at a high angle,
then there are possibilities of good speed range.
(c) The shape of the burble point.-If the lift past the burble
point falls off very rapidly, t he airplane can be quickly stalled. On
the other hand, a wing WIth a flat lift curve at the burble point will
avoid quick stalling. I n all the U. S. A. aerofoils the shape of the
curves at th e burble points is sufficiently flat t o be satisfactory.

Cd) The ~ ratio at small angles of incidence and small values of
Kv determine whether or not the aerofoil is reany suitable for high
speeds. We conform to Mr. Klemin's comparison value of lIy =
0.00086.
(Il) Movement of enter of prossure n.t low Rngl s.-Tho importn.nce
of this fact is readily apparent from consideration of stability. In
all the U . S. A. aerofoils the movement of the center of pressure is
not prohibitive or unsatisfactory.
(b) Structural considerations are satisfactory in such aerofoils.
(g) Subheads Ca), (b), and (d) are tabulated herewith for convenience of reference.

U. S. A. I, its maximum of 17.8, the highest of any U . S. A.. aerofoils, occurs at 3.0°, at which point its center of pressure motion is
fairly rapid but not so rapid as to make the am'ofoil undesirable.
This aerofoil would be undesirable as the wings of a very heavy machino, but it is very desirable as the wings of a fast pUl'Suit machine.
Its maximum Xy is sufficiently large to warrant a reasonable landing
L
speed. Its D at small values of lIy is excellent and usually better
than any of the other U . S. A. aerofoils. Because .of its slow-landing
speed and its great high speed and its burble point occurring at 15°,
U. S. A. 1 would make the most satisfactory pursuit machine wing of
all U. S. A. aorofoil with the gTeatest speed range of any U. S. A. aerofoils. Structurally it is excellent.
U. S. A. 4, with its large lIy of 0.00364, would be suitable and very
desirable for heavy machines and for machines in which the designer
is attempting to obtain a very slow landing speed. It is unsuitable

that of U . S. A. 6, so pursuit machines u ing U. S. A. 1 could be designed to have a slower bnding speed than those using U. S. A. 6.

many points, it is found that U. S. A. 1 has usually better values for
small values of Kv than has U . S. A. 6. Thus it seems that U. S. A. 1
is better than U. S . A. 6 for 11 pursuit machine. However, U. S. A. 6
could be used on a hi~h-speed machine that is only a trifle slowcr than
the machines using u . S. A. 1, but the machine using U . S. A. 6 would
land much faster than the one using U. S. A. 1. At 3°, the I1ngle of
mn.ximum ~ fo r both U . S. A. 1 and U. S. A. 6, the center of pressure
movcment of U. S. A. 6 is better than that of U . S. A. 1. U. S. A. 6 is
undesirable for use on a heavy airplane. Structurally it is satisfac~~.

.

U. S. A. 2 is next best to U . S. A. 4 for heavy machines or machines
designed for slow speeds . It is unsatisfactory for a pursuit airplane.
Structurally it is satisfactory.
U. S. A. 3 and U . S. A. 5 are above the average of aerofoils.

The general rules we have do not permit us to choose between
two aerofoils of nearly the same characteristics, so a designer should
actually go through the necessary computations, using each of the
several possible aerofoils in order to ascertain which aerofoil is the
best for the purposes of his design. As a matter of interest rough
calculations are here given for a pursuit machine, and designers can
follow the general method used herein for any type of airplane they
may happen to be designing.
Among the U. S. A. aerofoils, it seems apparent that U. S. A. 1
or U . S. A. 6 is best for a pursuit machine. For reasonable comparisons, the weight, horsepower available, and the parasite resistance
should be the same for both machines. The weigIit will be assumed
as 1,200 pounds, the parasite resistance as bemg represented by
0.025 P in pounds per square foot per mile per hour units, and the
propeller efficiency as given by the following table, though such a
propeller might be difficult t o obtain in practice:

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Thus we see that actual calculations demonstrate that U. S. A. 1
is better than U. S. A. 6 for a pursuit machine, considering speed
above, for it has a greater high speed.
The best climb of U. S. A. 1 is 1,450 feet per minute at 70 miles per
hour and for U. S. A. 6 it is 1,480 feet per minute at 60 miles per
hour. Although U. S. A. 6 can climb 30 feet per minute faster than
U. S. A. 1, yet the speed of U. S. A. 6 at which best climb occurs is
10 miles per hour less than the speed for the best climb of U. S. A 1.
We believe that the climbing ability of U. S. A. 1 is better for a
pursuit machine than is that of U. S. A. 6. Hence U. S. A. 1 excels
U. S. A. 6 in both speed and climb characteristics.
The above process should be pursued whenever there is any doubt
between the relative desirability of two or more wing sectIOns for
specmc purposes.
It would seem that Dr. Hunsaker is a trifle low in his estimate
wherein he states that an increase in camber above 0.08 for the upper
surface is disadvantageous, since four good U. S. A. aerofoils are
cambered as follows:
U. S. A. 2 has a camber of 0.088 per cent of the chord.
U. S. A. 3 has .a camber of 0.0868 per cent of the chord.
U. S. A. 4 has a camber of 0.089 per cent of the chord.
U. S. A. 5 has a camber of 0.085 per cent of the chord.
It is generally conceded that the angle of no lift has no connection
with the characteristics of an aerofoil. As a matter of interest the
angle of no lift occurs in the U. S. A. aerofoil as follows :

From the above table it appears that perhaps at some future date
it might be desirable to investigate whether or not the aerofoil with
the greatest negative angle of no lift is also the best aerofoil for heavy
aeroplanes or aeroplanes designed for slow speeds.

Since the iowest value of Kx in the U. S. A. aerofoils occurs in U. S.
A. 6, a designer designing for high speed only with no thought of

other considerations, could probably obtain a hi~her speed Wlth U.
S. A. 6 than with any of the other U . S: A. aerofoils.
In order to chock the vo.lves that wo ho.vo obto.ined in the tests of
the U. S. A. aerofoils, as R . A . F. 6 section made of wood was tested
and found to conform to former tests which are known to be satisfactory.
An examination of all the published

t curves of the R. A. F. sec-

tions tested at the M. 1. T . tunnel show the maximum ~ obtained
varied between a little less than 16 to a trifle above 17. Our maxi-

mum ~ is equal to 16.78. On page 41 of "Reports on Wind Tunnel
Experiments in Aerodynamics," Dr. Hunsaker says "It appears
tho.t undeteoted differences in workmanship and finish between two
models may cause a change in coefficients of not more than 3 ~r cent."
Let us assume for all R. A. F. sections tested at the M. 1. T. tunnel
Land D are correct within 3 per cent.

It is thus seen that all published results of the M. 1. T . on tests
of R . A. F. 6 are correct WIthin the limits of workmanship and finish
and that our test gives a result about the mean of all such tests.
It is suggested that it might be well if the United States Government owned standard brass aerofoils of the R. A. F . and Eiffel types
constructed with absolute accuracy and which could be available for
use on wind tunnels like the one at the M. 1. T . for checking the
accuracy of the tunnel whenever desirable. The Government has
standard weights and measurements. Why not apply this same idea
to aeronautics ~
In British Reports, 1912- 13, No. 72, :figure 14, the National Advisory Committee for aeronautics in England has suggested a method
of corrections for LV. U . S. A. aerofoils were tested at an LV
of 11 while R. A. F . 3, 4, 5, and 6 were tested at an L V of 6.3.
Making the proper LV correction for the English tests of the R. A. F.
6, we find the N. P . L . results and our results for tests on the R. A. F. 6

give the same maximum{ thus checking the accuracy of our series

. of tests. Reducing the R. A. F. and the U. S. A. aerofoils to the same
LV and tabulating the results we obtain the following:
