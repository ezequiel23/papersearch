The -work on cotton fabrics s 8 pfied to airphme wing coverings
~ b no means been cempleted, Eut certain prel.imiuq investigw
tions x aweshown usefil results, and in the belief that the eonolusions
already drawn VZUbe of value, the follow@ pr&ninmy report is
presented. Time hss not been available to put this matarial into
consecutive aud striotiy logiml form
It should be considered ss a
series of notss containing the salient features of the invdgwiion
developed up to this time.
The a pfication of cotton fabrios to airplane wings h= long been
desired, i ut the many unsumemful attempts ta substitute this fabrio
for the Mghlysatisfaotorylineu have givaurise to a gened belief that
cotton is out of the uestion.
The ob”@ionable 1 eat-ureaof the attempted cotton fabrics as compared to Len were :
1. Low Axing resistance.
Z. Poor penetration of the dope.
3. Little shrinkage upon the application of dope.
4. Poor restitution ~roperties.
5. Cracking or peehng of the dope during the application of stress
to iihefabric.
The Bureau of Standards undertook the investigation of a“ hue
L
fabrics with the tiew of tiding suitable substitutes for the
fabrics, and it w= decided that the *
to be considered were
cottq
rsmie silk, and hemp. Of t&sej the cotton ~er wss the
1 “cal one to b given rimary consideration.
% e long fibers, sU# as linen, ramie, and hemp, oan be grown in
this countr , but there are no faoiliti
for their spinning. The
fah.re to J evelop the manufacture of thEM products has probably
been due to the n60essarily high labor cost for cmreful owing of the

Fabric CP 25 when stretched on a frame in the same manner as linen
does not possess the necessary shrinkage, and has oor restitution
roperties. The dope will break when stress is app%
“cd to a doped
! abric of this nature. These undesirable features can be overcome by
stretching the fabric more tightly on a frame. This has many objections considering the practicabihty of such a procedure. The curves
show large stretch at the low loads.
Fabric CT 7 has practically a balanced stretch condition, and if
ut on a frame pro erly will show ood resuks. The thread count is

ww noted that one of the Italian pkums vvaacovered with a ramie
fabric of a more open structure.
Fabric CP 51 has manymof the characteristics of CT 7, but has a
better shrinkage upon doping due to the lower stretch in the filling
direction. we surface is somwhat smoother and the fabric is more

3. Cotton fabrics areas a rule more even in texture than linen.
4. Fabrim made of yarns mercerized under tension and with proper

toward &e solution of this probhn the Bureau of Standards has
undertaken to cordate with the actual usefulness of the fabric in
service the results of various laboratory wts tufterexposure to conditions intended to accelerate the ageing of the materiaI. The fol10

were mmmted on wooden frames. & e frames were placed running
east and west, so that the fabric had a southern exposure, with a
slope of about 10 degrees, which allowed rain to dram off quickly.
A good idea of the weathar conditions existing during the period of
exposure can be obtained from the weather records taken at the
American Univemity WaAington, D. C., and which the U. S.
Weather Bureau has kdly furnished. These data are summarized
in Table 2, and the number for each period will be used later in

L e wss opened a very

feasible method of controlling the time element, since, es has been
shown, if a fabric is stressed at very slow rates it makee little d&rence whether the fabric is stressed sinequal incremen~ of }oad or in
equal increments of stretch. In tlus method of applying mr pressure
there is Iittie flow and consequently the pressure maybe considered
as being
uaUy distributed. The ti pressure under the deflected
fabric was mm autographically against the deflection of the center

point of the fabrio by means of an ordinary steam indicator.
The co?@r of the inflated fabric at seved sections perpen-dculti~

Vertical e placement of small rods held at known and oonstant

fabric.
The results obtained with this improvised ap aratus were such as
to warrant the construction of a similar 8 ough more refined

above the point A has no value exoept for oheoking the stre

A will be dieoussed.

The shape of seotion 1 ISmfhmnoed dnmst entirely by the fabric

oommonl termed “crimp,” may be expressed as the iucmascd
h o?the yarns due to interlacing .
1
Y t the end of seotion 1, the crimp % as been taken out to such an
amount that the characteristic of the yarn has begun to redoroinate,
and there is at the end of section 2 an adjustment of t%e fabric.
The sha e of section 3 ia influenced by ti e ysrn characteristic in ita
oonstraine$ position. If the orimp is very small in one direction,
this portion of the ourve will be parallel to the load+tretch diagram
of an equalnumber of unwoven y-l
and there is a ihvergenco
from the diagram of the yarns se the crnnp of the fabric is increasad.
Hence it is ossible to as9ign reasons for the ohange in the sections
as cumpare1 with the diagram of the fabric before exposure.
If, as cited below, there is a radical
e or reversal in the curvature of section 1, and a slight change 9iR t e other sectio~{ or more
particnhmlyin seotion 3, the cause must lie in oertrunconstraining forces
which are not existent in the raw fabric. This condition is shown
in the 60 days’ exposure curve of fabric 10651. In this caee the
rubbw film wss found to be oracked at the reversal of the curvature
of the lower portion of the curve, and it is logical to assume that the
constraint was due to stiih+ing of the rubber.
Sometimes there is a m
of the three sections, as in the “ . a%
of the 30days exposure T%fa ric 1065L It is probable that

caused b constnuning forcaa of the same nature as those just referred
to, whi d persist throughout the entire low% portion of the curve,
unaccompanied by any noticeable deterioration of the raw fabric.
A comlderation of the load@retch diagrams of the w
parallel
of fabric 22151 and 22162 and the warp and filling of 221 0 and of
7
fabrio 22795 before and after exposure, would appear tu demonstrate
that the deteriorations of the raw fabric were made evident-only by
the deorease in the tensile strength, aims no change is evident in
sha e of the curves.
? here me four
of deterioration which might exist in the
balloon fabric and T “ch may appear ig the load@retch diagram:
w
1. One pl deteriorating.
2. Two p{ ea deteriorating.
3. The rubber*
deteriorating to such an extent that iti stretch
fails to follow that of the fabric.
4. Combinations of three with either one or two.
Deterioration of one ply is shown in the curves of fabric 22160,
30 da exposqre, where the bias ply h- lost considerable strength
and z e arallel fabric has remained constant. In every case an unproteote $ ply which has been e. osed to the weather aud directly
to the sun has deteriorated ra i 3 .
The condition of the two {ies eteriorsting without an apparent
deterioration of the rubber L
was not observed in these experimental fabrics.
An instance of two plies deteriora “ acoompauied by a discernible
deterioration of the rubber film is
3 own in the curves of fabrim
22151 end of 22152. k the bias curve of these fabrics, it is difficult
to determine the breaking point of the s@wn of yarns heiug tested,
since there a pears to be an incipient brdown of this s@an

determination of the contour surface of the
fabric at the time of. the bursting leads to the conclusion that any
vertical section taken through the center point conforms v
nedy
to an arc of a circle, or that the curvature of the surface is% e same
throughout.. @ some instances slight deviations *m this, condition were noted.
The tension m the fabric ma be approximate calculated by the
use of the simple formula for t%e tension in a ho J ow sphere of thin ~

Y
there ore look upon an or all of these task as reliable indicati~;%%
the changes which wo J d take place under service conditions.
The results after exposure to dry heat fail to show any great differenow between the various fabrica although as stated above, we know
that in actual service these differences exist. The curves plotted
from these radta do not correspond to the tests obtained on samples
exposed to the weathar. From this it is obvious that the dry heat
test is of littIe or no value as a means of predicting the life of balloon
fabrica It is posaib~ethat the introduction of mo~ture in these tests
