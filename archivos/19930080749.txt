FLEXIBLE PETROL PIPE.

Though no doubt .permanently fixed steel,-p+ping
for petrol
and oil systems in aircxaft is preferable to’copper piping~nevertheless rigid piping of any kind is liable to fracture by vibration or to dam~~e by careless workiiien, by accident, when
or
work is being done on other parts of the machine.

Obviously,

flexible piping is preferable to any kind of rigid piping if a
satisfactory flexible pipe which is petro13 oil, and waterproof
can be had.

Hitherto the right kind of pipe has been lacking - at any
rate since the Bowden flexible pipe was abandoned somewhere about
l“a5 - or else> where a satisfactory pipe has been found it has
been impossible to discover a trustworthy joint for-it. All
these difficulties seem to have been entirely overcome by the
Blaisdell Petro-Flex Tubing Co., Ltd., of Cassiobury Works, St.
Albans Road> Watford$ Herts.
“Mr. C. 1?.Abell, late R.N.A.S., who has been.introducing
this valuable invention to the Aircx-=t Zndust&, iells one that
the piping anC.the new joint has been more than favourab~y received. Which is only what one would expect. Tinereforeas soon

:.
,,.

as the final tests have been made by= and official approval has
been reeeived from the Air Ministry we may expect to see this
form of conveyor used very largely for all pipe-work on aircraft.

-2The form of joint used is shown very clearly in the attached’drawing. The pl~e itseif is composed of an internal
layer of gut.- either pig, ox, or horse - strengthened by canvas and protected from external pressure by mire winding’. himl gut is found to be proof against petrol, oil and water,
which is natural when one considers the nasty thi~s

animals

eat and drink and what water doss for one!s boots.

Canvas is

the very best strergtheni%~ mateial., and wire is certairily
r
the test anti-crush materi&l.
Altogether theze seem to be partic~arly bright prospects
for the piping$ which undoubtedly fi11s a long-felt want.
