PURPOSE OF THE ST DY.

This report makes available data which will aid the designer in determinlllg the plywood
that is best adapted to various all'craft part. It gives the results of investlgations made by
the Forest Product Labor tory of the United States Forest Service at Madison, Wis., for the
Army and Navy D epartment, and is one of a series of reports on the use of wood in aircraft
prepared by the Forest Products Laboratory for publication by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.
The object of the tudy was to determine, through compr ehensive tests, the mechanical
and physical properties of plywood and how these properties vary with the density, number,
thicknes , arrangement of the plies and direction of grain of the plies. While the data were
sought primarily and immediately with a view to obtaining llllormation needed by aircraft
designers, the results have a broader field of application.
USE OF PLYWOOD IN AIRPLANES.

Plywood i being used extensively in all'planes for fuselage sides, bulkheads, engine bearers, wing rib webs, gus et and thru t plates, flooring, diaphragms, and at times for partially
covering wings, in partic-qlar at the leading edges. In some machines stabilizer, elevator, and
rudder smfaces are covered with thin plywood. Its u e as a substitute for linen in covering
wings has, however, not yet found favor, chiefly on account of the excess weight over linen.
From the standpoint of general engineering design the selection of Veneer species and
thickness introduces elements quite distinct from those involved in the design of an ordinary
structmal member of wood. More variables are invo.lved, for in addition to the properties of
the various species there are added unique properties due to number of plies and thickness and
direction of the grain of the various plies. For the designer of aircraft certain further and
special considerations enter into the problem. In the first place, strength with a minilnum
weight is requll'ed, while in the design of most stationary structmal members weight is a minor
consideration. Again, the forces acting on the different parts of an all'plane are usually very
complex, and both their magnitude and direction can in many cases only be approxilnated.
The position and magnitude of the loads for which stationary structural :r,nembers must be
designed are, on the other hand, usually known with greater precision.
The complexity of the forces acting on airplane parts usually makes the designer's problem
one of determining relatively superior constructions rather than of exact computation of
requll'ed dimensions. Nevertheless, the actual size of some plywood parts of an airplane may
b e worked out with a reasonable degree of accuracy by using the strength data included in
this bulletin. An example of comparatively exact design is afforded in the construction of
large trussed wlllg ribs in which it is desll'ed to know the dimensions of the tension members
of wood. The table of tensile strength of veneer will serve for this pmpose, although the details
of fastening also require consideration.

DEFINITION OF PLYWOOD.

Much confusion has been caused by the indiscriminate use of the terms "veneer" and
"plywood." The formcr term should be restricted to the relatively thin sheets of wood cut
with special veneer machinery from the urface of a log revolving in a massive lathe or by slicing
or sawing from the face of a log, known, respectively, as rotary, liced, and sawed veneer. "Plywood," on the other hand, refers to the combination of several plies or sheets of veneer glued
together, usually so that the grain of anyone ply is at right angles to the grain of the adjacent
ply or plies.
PROPERTIES OF ORDINARY WOOD COMPARED WITH PLYWOOD.

I

Wood, as is well known, is a nonhomogeneous material, with widely different properties
in the various direction relative to the grain. This difference must be recognized in all wood
construction, and the size and form of parts and placement of wood should be such as to u'tilize
to the best advantage the difJ'erence in properties along and across the grain. It is the strength
of the fibers in the direction of the grain that gives wood its relatively high modulus of rupture
and tensile and compressive strength parallel to the grain. Were ita homogeneous material
such as cast iron, having the same strength properties in all directions that it has parallel to
the grain, it would be unexcelled for all structural parts where strength with small weight is
desired. As it is, the tensile strength of wood may be 20 times as high parallel to the grain as
perpendicular to the grain, and its modulus of elasticity from 15 to 20 times as high. In the
case of shear the strength is reversed, the shearing strength perpendicular to the grain .being
much greater than p'arallel to the grain. The low parallel-to-the-grain shearing strength
makes the utilization of the tensile strength of wood along the grain difEicult, since failure
will usually occur through shear at the fastening before the maximum tensile strength of the
member is reached .
The large shrinkage of wood across the grain with changing moisture content may introduce distortions in a board that decrease its uses where a broad, flat surface is desired. The
shrinkage from the green to the oven-dry condition across the grain for a flat-sawed board is
about 8 per cent and for quarter-sawed board about 4} per cent, while the shrinkage parallel
to the grain is practically negligible for most species.
It is not always possible to proportion a solid plank so as to develop the necessary strength
in every direction and at the same time utilize the full strength of the wood in all directions
of the grain. In such cases it is the purpose of plyw·ooa. to meet this deficiency by cross banding,
which results in a redistribution of the material.
In building up plywood a step is made in obtaining equality of properties in two directions,
parallel and perpendicular to the edge of a board. The greater the number of plies used for
a given panel thickness, the more nearly homogeneous in properties is thefini hed panel. Thus,
in an airplane engine mounting made of IS-ply veneer, the mechanical properties of the panel
parallel and perpendicular to the grain of the faces are almost the same. Broadly speaking,
what is gained in one direction is lost in the other. For a very large number of plies we may
assume that the tensile strength in the two dil'ections is the same and that it is equal to the
average of the parallel-to-the-grain and perpendicular-to-the-grain values of an ordinary board.
This is not always exactly true, since the maximum stress of the plies in both dil'ections may
not be reached at the same time. Internal stresses due to change of moisture content may
also tend to unbalance the strength ratio.

.

SCOPE AND METHOD OF TESTS.

Q

The results and conclusions which follow are based on tests of about 34 species. In
general, 8 thicknesses of plywood were tested, as follows: 3/30, 3/24, 3/20, 3/16, 3/12, 3/10,
3/8, and 3/6 inch.
Most of the tests were on panels composed of three plies of equal thickness of the same
species, with the grain of successive plies at right angles. In addition tests were made on plywood of various numbers of plies; having various ratios between the core and the total panel

thicknes ; having the plie glued at angles other than 0° with each other; and on plywood
in which the core and the face were not of the arne species.
B ending tests.- As a rule bending tests were made on specimens measuring 5 by 12 inches,
although some of the thinner pecimens were cu t to a length of 6 inche. In half of the tests
the grain of the face was parallel to the dir ction of application of the load, and in half perpendicular.
Figure 1 shows the method of conducting the column-bending test. The ends of the test piece
weI' rounded to approximately a emicircle. Deflections were mea ur d at the center of the
specimen as shown in the photograph. The product of the load and the corresponding deflection
was recorded as the bending moment. For orne of the thicker pecimens it wa not satisfactory
to test in column bending on account of eparation of the plie. These specimens were tested
as a beam in ordinary cross bending.
The formula for computing the column-bending modulus is given at end of report. The
re ults of the tests are in cluded in Table l.
In most case in column bending the direct compr ssive stress at the maximum moment
i only a small fraction of the bending or flexural stress, 0 that the column-bending modulus
may be used with little error in all computations in a capacity similar to the bending strength
or modulus of rupture of plain timber to ted in cro s bending. Like the modulu of rupture,
it i not an actual stre but a measure of the strength in bending.
Tension tests.- T est were made to determine the tensile trength of plywood both parallel
and perpendicular to the grain of the face. Specimen 3 by 12 inch~s in size were used, the
center por tion being trilluned down to approximatel. an inch wide. They were held by
ordi.nary flat grips, and tested in direct tension to rupture.
PlyviTOod tension member, while not very common, are in use and the data may be applied
111 computations.
The tensile strength is the average stress over the secti.on at failure.
The results of the tensile tests are included in Table 1 and 4 .
Splitting test.-For splitting tests quare pieces 31 by 3i inches were used. Upon the
center of the test piece a conical spear ( hown in fig. 2) was :fir t dropped from a height of
one-half inch. The spear was inche long and 2 inches in diameter at the upper end and
with the rod weighed 11 .22 pounds. Carrying the test piece upon its point it was then dropped
from increasing heights with an increment of one-half inch until failUl'e due to plitting occUl'red.
The resi tance of the material to splitting i represented by its "splitting energy;" the formula
for its computation is given near end of repor t.
The plitting energy is a measUl'e of resistance to splitting at the screw or bolt fastenings
a numerical
of veneer panels. It is merely a factor for comparino- different panels, and
quantity can not be used in de ign.
A comparison of the relative re istance to splitting of various three-ply panels will be
found in Table l.
Warping tests.- W arping may con i t of cupping or twisting, or a combination of these
two actions. Piece of plywood 12 inches square were used for warping tests.
To determine cupping, a straightedge was placed over a median line drawn on the specimen
perpendicular to the grain of the faces (see fig . 3), and the recession of the point deflected
farthest from the straightedge was measUl'ed. This rece sion was recorded as the cupping
of the panel.
To determine twisting, the panel was placed upon a flat sUl'face so that three corners
Ul'th corner was measUl'ed
were resting upon the surface. The distance from the sUl'face to the fO
as shown in figure 4 and recorded as the " twist in 12 inches."
Information of the kind obtained in this t est is of value in selecting a panel for structural
parts where flat, undistorted Ul'faces are important. The results indicate roughly the comparative resistance to external conditions that tend to warp or distort a panel. The smaller
the cupping and twisting under test, the more desirable the panel for flat work.

Thickness facto?' Kw.- Thi factor serves to obtain the thi.clmess of a ply of any 'pecies
equal in weight to a ply of yellow birch of unit thickness. It i obtained by dividing the density!
of birch by the density of the pecies for wh ich the thickness is desired. For yellow poplar,
for example, lhe thi kne s of a ply equal in weight to a 1/1 6-inch ply of birch i 1.54 X 1/ 16 =
0.096 inches .
Uses and properties of va?'ious species.- On the ba is of their mechanical properties, the
veneer specie commonly u ed for the face tock of plywood for airplane may be grouped as
follows :
Group I.-Beech, birch (sweet or yellow), hard maple, black walnut.
Group 2.- White elm,2 red gum, soft maple, mahogany (African or true), sycamore.
Group 3.- Ba wood , Spanish cedar , fir (grand , noble, or sih'er), cotton "'um, western hemlock, sugar pine,
white pine, yellow poplar, redwood , spruce (red, white, or Sitka).

Where a fl at panel, high bending trength, or high column strength with minimum weight
are desired, species of gr oup 3 should be u ed as face tock.
ome of these pecie , uch a spruce,
can not be fini hed properly wi thou t a con iderable amoun t of sand ing, and all but light sanding
is undesirable b.ecause it may unbalance the con truction. In fuselage bulkheads or other
hidden part where finish is secondary, any of the spe cie~ of OTOUP 3 hould be satisfactory for
face veneer as well as for core stock.
Hardne s, resi tance , to abrasion, and 'trength of fastening increase con iderably with
inerea ing density of wood, so that where anyone or all of these factor are of importance the
h eavier woods beginning with group 1 hould be used.
Where fmish i desired specie of group 1 or group 2 should be u ed.
Where the plywood must be steamed, or soaked and bent into a form in which it i to remain,
species of group 1 or group 2 hould be used.
Where failme of an airplane part i likely to occm from buckling, a in plywood fu elaae
in which the hell carrie considerable tress, it is recommended that the plywood be made
entirely of low-den ity pecies, uch as those in group 3. N umerou te t on plywood columns
have hown that three-ply column of low-density specie ', such as are illcluded in group 3,
carry from 2 to 2.5 time the load of three-ply columns of the same weight of species included
in group 1. Buckling is a form of column failure, and for that reason greater reoi tance to
buckling per unit weight would be expected from the use of low-den ity veneer.
SIZE, WEIGHT, AND TlllCKNESS OF COMMERCIAL VE EER.

The aver age length of sawed veneer heets is about 14 feet, and the maximum 24 feet;
the average length of sliced v neer is about 10 feet, and the maximum 1 feet; rotary-cut veneer
averages about 6 feet, with a maximum of 16 feet.
awed vene I' is seldom cut Ie s than 1/2
inch thiclc Sliced veneer of some specie may be cut as thin a 1/ 100 inch, but is eldom cut
thicker than 1/ 16 inch. Rotary-cut veneer of some species may be cut from 1/ 100 inch to almost
1/2 inch in thickness .
awed and liced veneer heets are limited in width by the diameter of
the log, whereas rotary cut yeneer may be any width con istent with easy handling.
Except for the 1/100 inch veneer, all the thicknesse Ii ted in Table 3 are commercial.
Table 3 may b used in computing the weight of veneer heet of any size and thicknes , and of
plywood made of any compination of the specie~ list d. A sfl.mple computation i gIven

JOI TS IN PLYWOOD P ANELS.

There are three type of joints commonly u ed for joining plywood panels: (a) Riveted
joints, (b) glued joints in individual plie , and (c) glued joint extending through the entire
thickness of plywood. These \-vill be con ider ed in detail.
Riveted joints .- The most ati factory joints of the ri veted typ are made with tubular
rivets . Tension te ts have shown quite conclusively that it is ery difficult to obtain more than

50 per cent efficiency with a ingle row of rivet. Efficiencies omewhat higher than 50 per cent
may probably be obtained if two or more rows of rivet are u ed. In such cases the rivets
hould bc staggered . The size of the rivet eems to have little effect upon the trength of the
joint, providing the proper pacing i used. The distance betwe n center of rivets should be
about equal to twice the out ide diameter of the rivets. It is obviou that for such spacing
very many rivet are required, and that the labor in making the joint i very great.
Joints in individual plies.-Two pieces of plywood may be fastened together by means
of glued joints in individual plies. Joints in individual plies take a variety of forms. (See fig.
7.) Strength,' ease of manufacture, and efficiency con idered, the simple scarf joint appears
to be the most desirable of the group. The simple butt joint should not be u ed where strength
is important. The edge joint is sati factory if carefully made. The slope of the scarf in the
simple carf joint hould be within the range of from 1 in 20 to 1 in 30.
The use of joints in individual plies has an advantage over the other type, in that the joints
in the plies may be staggered, so that a single defective joint only partially weakBns the entire
panel. The preparation of a joint of this type requires less time and labor than a riveted joint,
bu t more than a scarf j oint extending tlu:ough the entire thickne s of the panel.
Joints extending through the entire thiclcness oj plywood.- Two types of scarf joints extending
through the entire plyw'ood thiclme are shown in figure . The e are known as the straight
scarf joint and the Albatross scarf joint. It will be seen that in the Albatross joint the face
ply of the one panel does not meet the face ply of the second panel, or only partially meets it.

In place of being glued to wood that has the grain running in the same dire tion, the face ply
of one panel i glued to the core of the other panel, the grain of the core being at ·right angles
to the grain in the face. Joints in which the grain of the two piece joined i at right angles
are not so trong as joint in which the direction of grain in the two pieces is the same.

efficiency of over 90 per cent may be obtained with thi type of joint for a slope of scarf as low
as 1 in 10. On account of the variations in the eff ctivene of the gluing by different manufacturers it i recommended that a slope of scarf greater than this be used. A slope between
1 in 20 and 1 in 30 is recommended.

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTIOO.

Severe weakening of scarf joints is often cau ed by sanding the face plies at the joint
Observations on joints thus sanded showed that in some cases more than half of the face ply
was ground away. Inasmuch as the strength of a three-ply panel when bent parallel to the
direction of the grain of the faces lies almost entirely in the face plie , it is obvious that a reduction
in the thiclmess of the face plies will materially affect the strength of a panel. Consequently,
it is recommended that the scarf joint be lightly sanded by hand if at all, so as not to decrease
the thickness of the face veneer.

DATA ON THE DESIGN OF PLYWOOD FOR AIRCRAFT.
EXPLANATIO N OF TABLE

2.

When substituting one species for another in airplane plywood it is desirable to know the
thickness of veneer which will give either the same bending strength ~)l' the same weight as the
original material. The thickness factors Ks and Kw given in Table 2 will be found useful for
this purpose. For instance, the thickness of basswood veneer required to afford approximately the same bending strength as one-tenth inch yellow poplar, may be obtained by multiplying the thickness of the yellow poplar by the ratio of the thickness factor (K s) of basswood
to that of yellow poplar. The factor Kw may be used in a similar computation to obtain the
thickness of one species required to equ al the weight of another.

EXPLAN ATI ON OF T AB LE

3.

This t able gives th e approxim ate weigh t of individual sheets of veneer in ounces p er square
fo ot, making possible the compu tation of the weight of plywood built up of any combination
of thicknesse and ven eer species listed and of any numb er of plies. The approxima te weights
of two common water-resist ant plywoo d glues in ounces per squ ar e foot of glued surface are
also given.
It should b e r emember ed th at th e weight of wood is quite variable, and th at large differences from the figures are t o b e expected, particularly with small quantities of ma terial.
E xample : T o ge t the weigh t of a squ ar e foot of 5-ply wood consisting of I -ply of 1/12 inch basswood, 2 plies of 1/ 16-inch b asswood, and 2 plies of 1/20-inch yellow birch for faces,
at 12 per cent m ois ture, glued with casein glue.
W eight = [(1 X 2. 64) + (2 X L 98) + (2 0 2.62)] 1.12 + (4 X 0.4) = 14.9 ounces.
The example above is slightly in error through n eglecting the ch ange in volume b etween
th e m oisture content at 12 per cent and the moisture list ed in the t able.

DATA ON T HE DESIGN OF PLYWOOD F OR AIRCRAFT .
EXPLANATION OF TABLE

4.

This table lists th e tensile trength of three-ply woo d of varIO common veneer specIes
US
and the approximate trength of single-ply wood. The strength figure, given in pounds per
square inch, corresp ond to the moisture contents listed.
Sample compu tation: T o obtain the ten ile strength of three-ply wood consisting of two
1/20-inch bir ch faces and a 1/16-inch ba wood core.
T ensile trength parallel to face grain =2x 1/20 X 19, 20=1,9 2 pounds pel' inch of ·width.
Tensile strength perpendicular to face grain = 1 X 1/16 X 10,320 = 645 pounds pel' inch of
width .
This computation neglects the tensile trength of th ply or plies perpendicul ar to the
grain, which is comparatively small, and th e results are therefore slightly in error.
The mechanical pr oper ties of wood are quite variable, and the strength of individual
pieces may b e expected to differ consider ably from the aver age values given .
