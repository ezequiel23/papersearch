Fan brakes are widely used as absorptiun

dYl~ometers

in te sting

internal combustion engines because they are c omparatively simple, inexpensive, w1d flex ible.

They have, hmTever, the disadvantage t hat a

given fan will run at only one speed when t he engine is delivering
full power, tbat speed. being determined by the size, proportions, and
environment of tbe fa.n, and t):].e density of the air.

In order to be

able t o vary the speed at which a given power will be ab sorbed, English
manufacturers have for some time been u s i ng a cylinlrical housing around
the fan with one or t wo variable openings in the periphery.

The te s ts

here reported were undertaken by t he Automotive Power Plant Section of
the Bureau of Standards to determine how grea t a range of speed

Since the power

the speed raUo (uefined similarly to pmver ratio) obtainable with such
3
a fan is
{5 or 1.7. The J.ata show that improvements in the design
of the fan brake can make the speed ratio approach but not exceed a value
of 2 to 1.

The meaning of the terms power ratio and speed ratio is more

clearly seen frore t he dia.graos.

Data of the B. F. Sturtevant Com2any snow that the power ratio of a
•

centrifugal blower, which i s essentially the same as a fan brake, is indeFenient of the speed and size of the blower, depending only upon its
shape and pr.oportions,

an~

it is supposed t hat this is also true of fan

brak.es.

It has often been shown

exper~enta11y

that for a given fan brake,

the relation of power (hp) to speed (N) is expressed by an equatien of
the form
hp

= kN 3 . O

The constant k in this equation depend.s upon the size, proportion, and.
environment of the fan and toe density of t he air.

In order to obtain

another desired relation of speed to hcrsepower, one or
quanti ties c ontrolling tne constant k must be varied.

Although English manufacturers have long been using the method of
altering the environment. they are not

knov~

to have published any in-

formation showing the range of speed c ontrol available.

Hence, these

experiments were undertaken wi th a view t o a.nswering the following two
questi ons:
(1) .
(2).

What range of speed control is obtainable with a fan brake?
Given the rated horsepower an~ speed of an engine, what is
the diruueter of fan b~ake necessary in order to obtain
complete tests of pewer va. spee ~ ?

The general procedure of the experimental wor k was to mount a twobladecl pa,ddJ.e-wheel fan on a small electric dynamometer, bu:tId. a cyl-

This gave sufficient data to

de'i.,ermine the speed ani power ratios obtaiI"l..a.bJ.e by opening and closing
the ou.tlet, and the size of inlet for maximum speed control.
The fan consisted of two square pieces of 3 mm

(1/8 11 )

sheet alum-

inum abou.t 28 em (11") on each side, bolted to a steel arm 10

(3/8" x 3") by means of steel angles.

The diameter of the fan meas-

ured from tip to tip of the blades (the nominal diameter) was 1.1 me tars
(4411).

The proportions of the fan brake are shown in Fig. 1, which is

a section tru.'ough the fan blades lo oking toward the inJe I:; end of the
br~e.

The two ends of thd housing were sawed out of slabs of cleated

tongu.e and g!'oove pin

and a 45 em (18") strip of galvan;. ."ed iron nailed

around the per5.phery of the ends completed. the fan brake except for the
sli~ing

shutter.

The estimated

maxL~um

cost of

suc~

a fan brake in

January, 1920, labor included, is $25. 00.
The fan brake was mounted on a 50 horsepower Sprague electric dynamometer.

Data for horsepower-speed curves were taken wi th inlet diame-

ters of ~6 em, 50 am and 40 em (26, 20 and 16 inches) respect~vely, and
wi th inlet closed, the circumferential outlet open1.ng being changdd by

steps of 2 inches up to 30 inches (76 em) open for each setttng of tho
inlet.

The outlet uncovered ab out 75° of the periphery of the hou&ing

when the circumferential opening was 76 em (30 inches).

Readings of

static air pressure in the hOV$ing and air velocity through the outlet

The fact that the J.ines for St'\U'tevant blow-

er.s open and closed. are parallel, shows that the speed and. power rati os
are independent of size of fan, and it is assumed for the purposees of
this work that tIllS is als o true for fan brakes.

constant until the inlet diameter becomes greater than the inside diameter ox the blades, when it increases.

In the empirical equation for skin friction in rectilinear

where F

of skin friction

and the other symbols are the same as before, the constant
k was calcula.ted from the runs with the fan outl e t closed
on the assumption that the entire resistance to the motion
of the fan was due t o the skin friction of the cylinUdr of
air on tbe housing.

This constant was of the same order of

magnitude as that given by Zahm for rectilinear air flow
