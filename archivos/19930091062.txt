Light, weight is an essential factor in the design of modern airplanes, especially those for
military purposes, for which speed and maneuvering ability are of great importance. With the
best grade of materials and careful designing the light weight desired can be obtained, but only
by not using an excessive factor of safety. Under sueh conditions accidental or careless overloading of the airplane member must be avoided .
Certain part of an airplane are subjected not only to the stresses imposed by the aerodynamic or flying load, but also to the initial stresses, caused by the tension in the stay and drift
wires. An appreciable initial stress in these wires is nec essary to maintain th e alignment of th e
machine. In many cases the initial stresses have been found to form too large a proportion of
the total load. Failure of th e structure in service has resul ted from an improper adjustment of
the turnbuckles in the stay and drift wires and cables .
It has been customary to depend upon the judgment of the mechanic assembling an airplane for securing the correct initial tension through adjustment of the turnbucldes . They
secured what they consid ered the proper uniform tension by the" feel " of the wire or by listening
to its vibrant sound when plucked with the finger. Either of these methods is obviously erude
and inaccurate, owing, among other things, to the widely varying diameter and length of the
wires . Some experiment have shown that wires thus adjusted for equal tension have really
varied by several hundred per cent. A dangerous condition may thus b e developed by causing
overloading of airplane members through adjustment of initial tension. This emphasizes th e
need of an apparatus to determine accurately the load in a flexible t ensile member .
Several instruments for this purpose have been devised, but most of them are inaccurate,
cumbersome, or require the services of an experienced person for their successful use. The
Tensiometer, on the other hand, is simple in construction, accurate, and easily and quickly
operated even by inexperienced persons .

ANNUAL REPORT NATIO :rAL ADVl ORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS .

The instrument consists essentially of a frame with supports spaced 10 inches apart,
between which a section of the wire or cable is adjusted. Midway between these supports, and
operated by hand grips, is a plunger which deflects the wire 0.1 inch from it normal position.
The operation of deflecting the wire compresses a calibrated spring. A dial indicator measure
the deformation of the spring and thu the load on the wire. One revolution of the indicator
pointer corresponds to a load of 1,000 pounds, and tbe , malle~t dial division , to a 10-pounrlload.
The Tensiometer is marle direct reading by graduating the indicator dial upon the loading
spring so as to read tension in the wire instead of load upon the spring. A second dial indicator
allows the simultaneous determination of the deflection to the neare t 0.001 inch. The use of
these two sensitive indicators for accurately determining the position and load upon the wire is,
in a great measure, the reason why accurate result are obtained with the Ten iometer.
The theory upon which the instrument is based is very simple. If a wire, under tensile
stress, is supported at two points and loaded at the middle of the span thus formed a system
of three forces in equilibrium is e tablished. If the span and deflection are kept con tant, as in
this instrument, the deflecting force is a constant fraction of tbe tension in the wire.
In use it is never desirable' to attach the Tensiometer to the wire. It is simply put into
place as shown in figure 2 and the grips brought together until the proper deflection is obtained.
The tension in the wire is then read from the other dial, which give the value directly in pound, .

In any instrument of this type there are two po sible sources of error. On account of the
inherent stiffne of the larger wires a force is necessary to deflect them even if they are under
no tensile load. If the wire is short and held in a rigid frame\: ork the ten, ion in it i increased,
in the development of the required deflection. This is evident when one con iders that there
is a slight increase of length of the deflected cable over its original length.

The correction for both of these errors may be found by calculation or preferably by
calibration of the in trument. Fortunately,' the corrections for both are of uch a nature
thfl,t they are easily made when a constant deflection of the wire is used.
The error caused by the actual lengthening of the wire i usually mall. The resulting
increase in t,be total load depend upon the sectional area of the wire and its total length. It
60000A
may be cxpre sed by the formula p = '-y;- ill which P is the increase in the total load

in pounds due to the deflection of the wire: A, the sectional area of the wire in square inches;
ftnd L, the total length of the wire in inche. If the error is computed by means of this formula
for the conditions met in practice, it will be found to be man. It hould also be remembered
that the formula assumes that the wire are held rigidly at their ends wben the insLrument
is applied. Any yielding of the trueture to which the wire is attached ,,;ill furthe.r reduce the
error, so that it appears reasonable to neglect this error for airplane work.
The error due to the tiffness or beam action of the wire i more seriou ' . Although it is
negligible for wire of mall diameter, a correction i required for large cables and wires. Any
theoretical di cu sion of the magnitude of this error involve the section modulu ' of Lhe wire
and tbe amount of end constraint acting at the supports.
•
Aside from the unknown ection modulus of the cables it is evident that, the amount of end
1'e train t varie' with the amount of tensile load on tbe cable. With no load tbe cable probably
acts as a simple beam and approaches a fixed ended condition with the increase in tensile loading .
.\. calculation of the beam action i therefore impracticable and the only satisfaetory method
of finding the ('ol'l'cetion to be applied i ~o 'alibrate the instrument for the various sizes of
'wires and cabJes upon which it is to be used. Calibration Clli'ves have been obtained for InO t
of the size oj 'o lid airplane wires of both r.ircular and streamline section.
imilar curves are
available for all ~izes of cable in use on airplanes.

T o obtain the e curves the cable or wire wa suspended from a beam and the desired
amount of load applied by the use of dead weights, thus insuring a constant load on the wire
and the elimination of all sounes of error except that of the beam action of the wire or cable.
Various incroments of load were used depending upon the ultimate strength of the wire, hut in
all ca es a sufficient numher of reading were taken to determine the curve. The calibration
curves fol' all the wires and cable te ted are ·hoWIl on the accompanying curve ~heets. 'rho
actualloclds tlre plotted as ordinates and the indicated loads or the dial reading::; as ahscissae.
Since the same scale have been u ed for ordinates and abscissae, the curves should be ::ltraighi
line having a slope of 45 degrees to the vertical if tbe indicated load equals the actual load.
An examination of the curves shows that the beam action causes less error for the low tensile
loads than for the higher loads. Also the curves for the small cables practically coincide with
a 45-degree line, but those for the larger cables and for all solid wires show thaL the indicated

load exceeds the actual load. However, in most ca 'es the slope of the curves is approximately
45 degrees for loads of over 200 pounds. It i thus possible to make a constant correction equal
to the horizontal distance from the curve to a 45-degree line passing through the origin. On
a curve which does not have a 45-degree slope, a conatant may still be used without serious error
provided it i taken from the curve at the working load of the cable. In case this working load
exceeds 1,000 pounds, the maximum load applied, the constant should be the correction for
1,000 pounds.
This instrument can therefore be adju ·ted to road correctly for a perfectly flexible wire of
great length or for any particular wire of given length and diameter.
1 The correction conatants obtained experimentally vary for nonflexible cables from
20
pounds for h inch to about 550 pound for t inch cables; from 20 pounds for J o. 12 (0.08081
inch ) to 130 pounds for o. 8 (0. 1285 inch solid wire ot circular section, and from 40 pounds for
ft inch streamline wire to 575 pounds for i inch streamline wire.
Experimental work upon the larger cable show that a considerable variation in the
indicated reading at any load may be expected on cables over t inch in diameter. In tho case
of i inch nonflexible cables this variation may be as much as 100 pounds, but when it i considered that such a cable has a breaking strength of 15,000 pound the error is seen to be le ·s
than 1 per cent.
