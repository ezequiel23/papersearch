SLIP-STREAM CORRECTIONS IN PERFORMANCE COMPUTATION.
By EDWARD P. WmmR.
.

In computing the performance of an airplane, the ‘values taken for the slip-stream correction
have a very marked eflect on the results, both as regards the speed required for flight at a given
angle of attack and as regards the horsepower required, and a mistake in edi.rnating the magnitude of the correction factor may cause considerable errors in the prehninmy estimate of performance attainable. Notwithstanding the @portance of the slip-stream effect relatively
little study has been devoted to it and the proper way of treating it still remains largely uncertain. This lack of knowledge as to the magnitude of the correction and its eflects is amply
attested by the wide variation among the methods employed by designers engaged in the
making of performance computations. Some have ignored the correction entirely. Others,
seeking a slightly greater accuracy but not d=iring to embark on too laborious a set of computations, have made an over-all allowance, increasing the total resktance of the machine
(imluding
both
paraeiti r=ktmce and fig
drag) by 10 per cent or 15 per cent. Such a
device is frequently employed when performmce is to be computed directly from a windtnnnel test on a modeI of the complete machin& and when only the total resistance is Imown,
no data on the redktwme contributed by difl’er@ parts of the structure %eing available. As the
proportion of the tatal rwistance which Iiea in the slip stream varies @dely between dif?erent
typ= of machin=, this method can manifestly lead to. nothing more than a very rough approximation. The next step, to further increase tie exactness of the performance computations, is
to consider the reastance broken up into two parts; that due to members inside and thiit due to
membem outside the slip stream, and to treat these two parts as having different relative air
speeds. The speed used in computing the r-istance of the parts outside the dip stream area
is equal to the air speed of the machine; that Wd for the parts inside the slip-stream is eomewhat higher. The amount of the Merence between the two has been much in dispute, but the
corrections generally applied range from 10 P@ mt to 20 per cent. That is to say, the velocity
is considered to be from 10 per cent tO 20 per c@ntgreater inside than outside the slip stream,
and the resistance of an object k that area iS ther~ore tak~ m from ZI per cent to 44 per cent
greater than the ra+stsnce of the sue object would be if it were removed from the zone ~f
.
influence of the propelIer draft.
Whatever the value that may be taken @ the correction factor, it is almost invariably
considered to remti comt~t at a! speeds of f%ht, ~d it is ~ h assumption that the greate@
eource of error lies. When the mgme is kept ra: full throttle, and aIl the reserve power
is used in csxsi.ng the mactie ~ climb) tie w speed bem relatively low, the ratio of slipstream velocity to vdmity of adv~ce ~ q~te e~d~tly be c-o~iderably @her than when the
flight path is horizontal, with a higher speed of adv~ce or with a throttled engine. The exact
manner of the variation of slip-stream effect d be taken up a little Iater.
We may attack. the problem of tie sliptream @mection ~ either of two ways, both of
which we shall discuss. In the fit place, we WY base ou corrections on wind-tunnel tests
of propeller models. Unfortunately, there k very little data available on the ,velocity of the
flow of the air behind a propeller under test. Secondly, we may depend on pure theory, determining the mean slip-stream velocity from @wgy considerations. While this is not strictly
valid, it. affords an bwwt~
mea~ of obt*g
data for compation, and of extending the
experimental results.

EXPERIMENTALESULTS.
R

q

Measuramenta of slip-stream effect for model propellers have been made by Eiffel, at his
laboratory near Paris, and by Ria%ouchimky at KouKchino. IIMM”s results are the more
valuable, ae the propeller used during the t@s was mom nearly like those used on aircrnft tit
the preeent time than were the mndele employed at Kciutchino.
It should be noted that-all these @6FWts
deal with propellers tested with no other
objects in their neighborhood, and that the results might .be materially modified by the mutual
/ interference-of the prope~er and the ot~ parta of-the-machine. “ This ti particularly trui o!
! the body, inasmuch as it is very close to the propeller and is immediately behind the lmst
~ eflio.ientportion of that member, so that .it has somew@_t the same tiect of streardining tho
~ hub and guiding the air acmes the mow e%ctive portic+of the blade .m has a sp~ner ~ front.
: The effect of the body on the propeller would then be such as to neutralize, at least in part, the
inorease of body resistance caused by the slip-stream. This effect wotid apply primarily to the
body, the resistance Qf.svhich,if itis well designed, is a relatively small pm-t of the total parasite
i
resistance in the slip-stream, The effect of the struts, tail surfaces, and other members on the
r
action of the propeller would probably be so small as to be neg~lble, thanks to-their distance
!
behind the propeller ~d to the fact that they lie behhyl the c@e@ive portion of the blades
~
rather than directly behind the hub.
The ratio of slip-stream velooity to velooity of advance, like every other factor or propeller
performance, is, for geometrically similar propellers, a function of the nondimensional ratio
V/ND. Sinca itisnecessary to apply@ widely di.ilerentpropellers the data obtained by tests
of two or three special cases we must seek some meaus of comparison, and this means is provi~ed
by the provisional assumption that the ratio of slip-stream velocity to flight velocity at the
speed of maximum propeller e.fliciency is the same for all propellers. We may then conder
the slip-stream eflect to depend on the ratio of V/i’Vl? h ( V/i’VD)’, or, for a given propeller
whre V is
“the act~al speed-of flight and” V’ the speed for
diameter and engine speed, on V/V’,maximum propeller eflloiency at “the same number of revolutions per minute. This is the only
method open to us if we rely solely on experimental data, but we shall see latar”that the use of the
momentum theory makes it possible to actually computa the slip-stream effect for a given
propeller, and that the magnitude of this effect varies somewhat with.blade form, blade width,
number of blades, pitch-diameter ratio, etc.
EXffel’sexperiments 1were performed on his propeller No. 9, which has quite a normal blade
form, with straight trailing edge md leading edge so Cmyed as to give a maximum blade w~dth
approximately three-quarters of the way out from hub totip. The pitch at all pointe w~ 0.7 of
the diameter, and the mx&mm efficiency (75 per cent) was secured when V/ND wse equal to
0.6, corresponding to a speed of flight of roughly 105miles per hour with a Liberty engine turning
1,700 revolutions per minute and & two-bladed propeller 9 feet in diameter. ThG ratio of
effective pitch to diameter for best efficiency therefore wae not very far from-current practice.
The air velocity in the slipstream was determined by pitot tube measurements at fivo
points, placed at 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.96, arid 1.1 times the radi~ from hub to tip. That is, the last
point was actually slightly outside of the propeller disk area. To determine the extent to which _
the air spreads out and the added velotity disappears as the distance from the propeller is
increased, three such sets of pointa were tried, the tit being only 0,04 of the propeller diameter
of
behind the plane of the trailing edges of the propeller blades, the second beiug located 0.2 the
diameter behind that plane, and the third being sepWa@ from the propeller by a distance equal
to its diameter.
The conclusions to be drawn directly from the results of these tesk maybe tabulated briefly
as follows:
(a) The slip-stream velocity ~ a maxim~ at a radius of about ().6 of the Warms from
hub to tip.

OOWUTATION.

(t) At low speeds of advance and large slip percnritages the slip-stream velocity drops off
very rapidly near the edges of the propeller disk. In the case under examination, @ moderate
transitional speeds (V/ V’= 0.4 k V/V’= 0.6), the added slip-stream velocity (i. e., the.diil’erence
between 17s
and V) at the radius 0.96was from 40 per cent to 70 per cent less than that at ia “us0.8.
\
At h~her speeds of advance, a decresee in slip-stream in going out from one of these poin to
the other is still noticeable, but it is much less abrupt and 1sssmarked.
(c) At points which are neither very near to the center nor to the edge of the propeller disk,
the velocity varies very little with distance from the propelIer, at least within the limits of these
experiments. At the higher
speeds of translation, there is
a slight tendency for the
velocity to incresae as the distance from the propeller increases.
(d) Near the center of
the propeller the velocity
drops off somewhat, but not
nearly so much or so abruptly
as it does near the tip.

FOR AERO~AUTIOS.

Although the above assumption as to slip-strew diarneter_may be aocepted as mgiataring
sufficiently cloiely with experimental results, it can bo shown theoretically that thg diameter
of the stream should vary with slip I%atio,or, for a given &@ne speed and propeller diametm,
with the speed of flight. R. E. ~oude has shown that the increase in velocity of the fluid
before it reaches the. propeller should be ~xactly equal to the ad~ed velocity imparted after
passing through the propeller, or, using algebraic symbols, thati~V- ~-~(V’, V), where V
–
is the speed of flight, VI the indraught velocity, and JI the slip-stream velocity. Since the
same mass of fluid passes eve~ point along the stream in a unit of time, the product of
velocity and stream area must be the same at all points .if compressibility of the fluid be neglected. We shall then have, assuming the cross-section area of the inflowing—
current to be
_.—equal to the area swe~t by the prope~er:

This ratio would vary from a minimum value of 0.71, under static conditions, to a maximum
conditions is ever
of 1.0 at the speecl where Vs= V and there is no thrust. As neither of these—
approached in normal flight, we can safely say that the theoretical value of-#

will not wander

far from the one (0.9) to which we have already been led by empirical data.
The most striking thing about the curves of figure 1 is the remarkable degree of constancy
of 7J v’. It appeati-iliat, so long as the engine speed “iikeptzonst.ant, the slipstream velocity
is almost independent of the speed of flight, except at speeds well above that of maximum

eflicicncy.
Since V, is so nearly constant, it is evident that V,/ V will immeaserapidly as V decreases,
becoming infinite when the macl@e is being held stationary on the ground with the engine
running, prior to the starting of a flighti The method, which I have ahyady mentioned, of
computing performance by assuming V’1V to have a comtant value of 1.15 or 1.2 h ticreforo
manifestly quite incorrect except for a single speed somewhere in the neighborhood of the
speed of maximum propeller efficiency. To de@nine the correction factor for any other speed
we must-have recourse to slipstream velocity ”curves similar to those of figure 1. The error
introduced by the assumption of a wmstant oorreotion factor will obviously be most important
at me low and moderate speeds which correspond to most efficient climb, and undoubtedly
accounte for the difficulty which has usually been experienced in computing rate of cJ.imbi
It is well known that, although the maximum horizontal speed of a new machine can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy from performance computations of the ordinary type
or from a wind-tunnel test of a model, an attempt to predict c~imbing speed in a similar fashion
very commonly giv~ a value @tinctly higher than that found in a fredight
test of the
completed m&chine.

EFFECTOF SLIP-WI’REAMN PERFORMANCE.
O
The method of applying the slipstream correction to the parasite rwistance of the parta
inside the slip-stre”iunarea b secure the corrected total resistance and the horsepower required
for flight is simple and obvious, differing in no essential particular from that employed when
the correction factor is assumed to-remain constant.
We have been considering so far a ease in which the engine speed @ a~umed to remain
constant at all speeds of ffight,”a case which is never exactly realized. If the throttle bc+
kept
open, the load on the engine will be greatest, and the revolutions per minute will consequently

be lowest, when the slip percentage is gretit@; or, in other words, when the speed of “flight is
lowest, and the en@e speed with open tbmttle may be 5 per cent or more lower when the
plane is olimbing at ag angle of attack of nl;out 8° than when it is flying level at an aggle of
attack in the neighborhood of – 1°. The vm%tion of revolutions per minute is small, however, and we shall not go far astray if we stick to our original assumption that the engine speed
remains constant so long as the throttle is wide open. We have now ta consider the effects of
partially throttling the engine, and the modifications of slip-stream effect which are involved.
When the throttle is partially closed the en&e speed is reduced and the value of I“/ND, the
propeller slip function, is therefore increased. It is evident from F%. 1 that an increase in
V/ND causes a decrease in the ratio of V8 to V. If the engine be throttled to half its original
number of revolutions, for example, maintaining the same speed of flight and varying the slope
of the flighkpath, the value of ( V)ND )/(V/h?D)’ will be doubled and the ratio of V, to 17will
be reduced, for a machine flying at 40 per cent of the speed for which the propsUer was designed,
from about 2.6 to 1.4. The parasite resistance of park in the slip-stream would then be
reduced by 71 per cent by throttling the engine, although the speed of @ht would remain
the same. This, of course, is an extreme case; as the engine speed in level flight -would seldom
drop to less than 75 per cent of the rabd spc%d. If the plane is gliding with the en$ne cut
off, the slip-stream eftect will of coume disappear entirely.
It is of interest now to examine the variation of the slip function and of the slip-stream
correction when the machine flies at different speeds in the neighborhood of the maximum
attainable, the engine always being throttled just sticiently to keep the flight-path horizontal.
When the plane is flying at high speed the angle of attack is small and the coefikient of wing
drag is near its minimum value. This coefficient .DOwiIl therefore remain almost constant if
the angle is varjed sIightly, and the total wing drag will be very nearly proportional to the
square of the speed for small changes in speed in the neighborhood “of the maximum attainable.
The parasite resistance is always proportional to the square of the speed, neglecting the small
effect of inclination of the body, struts, etc., and the total resistance will therefore be proportional to the square, and the horsepower required to the cube, of the speed of flight, provided that the slip-stream correction factor remains constant. This relation, it must be remembered, holds only in the neighborhood of the maximum speed of flight (say for angka of attack
between – 2° and + 3°). It can be shown that, if we assume the validity of the blade element
theory of propeller design, the power absorbed by a given propeller is proportional to V if
the slip function be kept constant. Since the ‘horsepower absorbed must vary as 1’ in order
that it may be equal to the horsepower required for Ievel tlight, it is evident thit the slip
function will be approximately constant so long as the m@ine flies in a horizontal path at w
angle close to that of minimum drag. To take a concrete-illustration, if the speed of flight be
decreased 10 per cent the mkximum power required for flight will decrease h (.9)’, or 73 per
cent of the original value. In order that the slip function may remain constant the engine speed
must be decreased by 10 per cent. Since the value of ~’/Nll is unchanged, the ratio of slipstream velocity to speed of flight wilI also remain unchsuged, so long as the flighhpath is
horizontal and the speed is fairly high. At very low speeds the slip-stream correction factor
in horizontal flight is larger than at those in the neighborhood of the maximum, as the revolutions per minute decrease 1sss rapidly than the flight speed, and the-slip function co~equently
decreases at low speeds.
DEDUCI’IONS
FR03i THE X1OMENTU~I
THEORYOF PROPULSION.
Our deductions to date have all been based, owing to an unfortunate paucity of cuxperimental data, on a single set of tests b which only one propelIer was used. It is now of interest
to examine the question from another point of view, and see what we can learn by the applica-

tion of pure theory.
The Rankine-l?roude theory of fluid propfiion is based on the assumption that the thrust
given by a ptopeller is equal to the skrnward momentum imparted to the fluid in unit time.

‘l’ho figures obttiined above led to certain genmd conclusion as to the dependrmw cd {ho

on pitch, being high for those propellers in wbic.h the pitch-diameter rutio is least. Eiiel’s
No. 1, for examplq which shows a very high VJ 1~,had a pitch of only about one-half the ditimeter, whereas No. 20, for which V,/ F’ was only 1.065, had a pitch of 1.4 times the diameter. .It
appwys, furthermore, and rather mrprisingly, that the.slip-stream effectis substantiallyindependent of blade %idth and blado form, the propelhm with blades of comt.ant width showing,
on the whole, a slightly higher VJ T’ than those witdl more rounded blade tips.

using the Ihewiecki,

blades are exactly the same as one wide ono, but nnalyais of experiments makes it appear that
that assumption is far from the. truth, and that a given blade area will absorb more power
wheu it is subdivided among several blades than” when it. is concentrated in two.
