This report is intended to cover the progress that has been
made in both the manufacture and util~tyof light alloys in the
United States stncg the first part of 1919. Much of this progress
is the result of investigations either started during the war period and cmnpl.eted
since the declaration

of tho a..mi$tioe
or of work

that has been a natmral consequence from experience gained during
the

W$il?.

Of those light aluminum alloys

whioh can be worked, duralunin

or material of similar composition, because of its inherent possibilities is probably the most widely used and naturally has reoelvod
the most attention at the hands of investigators, Dr. Merioa and his
associates at &he Bureau of Standarda have greatly inoreased our
knowledge of the manufacture and he8t treatment of dur81unin. It has
shown* that it was advisable to prehebt the ingots previous to roll}

ing somewhat higher than was customary, nsmely to preheat to 500°C
and then roll at 450%,

The best.quenching temperature was found to

lie between 510 and 515°C and quenching should be in hot water.

Gibson*** has also investigated the f~tigue resistwmwe of various
duralunins and corvsludes
that weight for weight forged and heat-treated
duralumin is equal to, if not superior to forged steel in its fatigue
resisting properties, He also states that under certain limitations

As an exsmple of the increasing U1313 of duralunin there might be
oited the all-metal planes such as the Larsen or othrs
German Junker models.

effect of various additional elements

such as copper, zinc, manganese, magnesium and n~~el were studied
and these investigators showed that certain of the casting

alloys

were also subject to beneficial results from heat treatment. This
practice was commended to the manufacturers of castings for realization of its comercial possibilities.
Jeffries and Gibson”*

also

investigated the effect of heat treat-

ment.upon cast aluminum alloys and suggested that more uniform results could be obtai-aed heating the castings in a bath of fused

niter followed by quenching in oil, thus reducing to a mirlimunthe teadency for the atmosphere to permeate and oxidize the intarior of porous
castings.
