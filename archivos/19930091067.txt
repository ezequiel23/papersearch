The study of aeronautical fabrics has naturally M to a consideration of the bwt metihoch
of attaching and fastening together such materials. The following group of expsrimants does
not completely cover this subject, but it is believed that the results are of praotical value and
that they may serve to indicate further lines of research into the stress distribution in built-up
fabrics.

METHODS OF FASTENING WING FABRICS.

The supposed failure of the fabrics on the Bristol and De Haviland plamesnecessitated an
investigation of stresses in the fabric during flight. The rcmdt proved concbidy
that the
failurea were not what might properly be called fabric failures, but were caused by the Iacing
cords pulling through the upper fabric and by the failure of the lacing cords due to chafing.
The method of attaching the upper fabric to the wing employed at that time would appear
to be very poor engineering. The total load on m area of fabric defined by the @stance between
lacings and the width of a bay concentrated on a very small area of fabric defined by the bearing
surfam of the ktcirg cord. The fabric, considering it to be supported along the rib, has a factor
of safety of from 9 to 10. ObviousIy, the factur of safety at the king points is admmely
low and conditions of abnornd flight might readily tear the fabric at these places of support.
This condition was =aggerated by high vibrahy
streses. TM specimens from the wing
fabric of the planas that failed showed that the fabric itself had not weakened nor did it show
any measurable indications of change in properties.
The Bureau of Standards suggested that a corded tape be put on the surface of the fabric
along the rib and that it be so doped that a good bond would exist between the fabric and the
tape. The Iacingmshould then be placed over the cord tape at intervals of not more than 4
inches. The wind friction tape shouId then be placed on. This method of reinforcing has since
been tried out in service tests and found to eliminate the trouble.
The structure of the reinforcing tape fumlly decided upon was:

additional ooata of dope were then applied.

oords.
The speoimens were plaoed in the jaws of the testing maohine and tension neoessary to

It will be noted that there is very little difference between the resietanoe of the ;abric to
the pulling out of the oorda whether they are placed on the bias or not. The warp of these
fabrim has practically twice the stretch of the Ming, and there is very little difference between
the strength of the warp and tilling yarne. &3 a result, it iOlogicsl to expect that the warp
yarns were carrying very Iittle of the load at the time the fig
yarn ruptured when the curd
is placed on the bias. Considering this, there can be no object in plaoing the present fabric
on the bk, from the consideration of either the laoinge or the fabric between the wings.

LACING CORDS.

Experiments were made to determine the strength of laoing oords and whether or not
ootton cards could be substituted for the linen cords. Henoe, the properties of a king oord
which are of interest are:
L Tensile strength
2. Resistance to abrasion.
3. Resistance to repeated stresses.
An examinationof the streasss causing rupture of a laoing curd under flight oonditiona
will lead to the cmolusion that a cord fails because it is weakened by rubbing against the rib
and beoause it is subjected to rapid vibratory stresses.

Rceulte givan in Table A were obtained from tests to determine the reIative resistance of
the cords to stresses owurring during flight conditions.
?’ende ~trength.-’l%e tie
strength of the l&m and cotton lacing cords are given in
the table. Owing to the fact that the quantity of linen cord was ~ery much limited, it was
impossible to make as large a number of teata with each cord as was desirable.
The teasile strength was determined by breaking a single strand.
The effect of waxing is practically negligible so far as these tensile strength teds indicate,
for no consistent diibrence in the strength of waxed and unwaxed cords was observable. This;
however, is about what we wotdd expect.
The strength of a cord impregnated with paraffi is somewhat less. Ordinary beeswax
was used in the testi.
Almwion (fhzy).-ll%ie fraying twt was made by allowing the cord under test to rub upon
a spruce wood surface, the line of the thread being perpendicular to the grain of the wood.
A spool of spruce was mounted on an axis (parallel to grain). The cord was fastened
at one end and brought over the spool, carrying a 5-pound weight@ the other end. The spool
oscillates through approximately 90° at 200 revolutions per minute. Tnis means that the
string is rubbed 200 times per minute in each direction of its length or 400 rubs in all. The
operation was continued in each case untd the cord broke. The number of rubs before breaking
is recorded in data.
Waxing greatly improvm resistance to abrasion in both linen and cotton cords. The
waxing effect is greater in the linen than in the cotton cords.
q

Source

of error,—

Uneven wearing of the spruce surface.
Heat produced, due to friction.
Di&rence in twist in the linen cords.
Z%n#ion(@y).-An
apparatus was improvised to apply a force to the cord (longitudinally)
at regularly repeated intervals. The force used was approximately 25 pounds and gave the
cord a jerk 200 per minute. This causes the fibers to suddenly draw close togethar, as the load
is applied, then to spring apart as the load is removed. The friction thus produmd results in a
weaxing of the individual fibers until finally a break occurs.
If this alternate separation and drawing together is prevented or dimhished, as is the case
when the cord is waxed, the wearing due to friction is much reduced and the cord doea not break
so soon. The data gives the total number of jerks before the break occurs.
Hare waxing seems to add to the life of the cord, the effect being more marked with the
linen than with the cotton cords.
All these experiments and accompanying data serve merely as comparative tests.
SUMMARY.

From these tests it maybe concluded that1. The unwaxed cotton cords are materially better resistors of abrasion fray than the
unwaxed linen.
2. The waxen linen and cotton have practically the same resistance to abrasion fray.
3. The w=ed or unwaxed cotton cords are materially better than the waxed or unwaxed
linen as a resistor of tension fray.
FASTENING OF TRAILING EDGE.

The sewing together of the fabric at the trailing edge of a wing appeared to be a laborious
and expensive operation, and from preliminary tests made at the factories under flight conditioIIEit appeared that lapped and pasted faatening was satisfactory. The following teeta
were made to detarrnine the efficiency of the pasted lap and the sewed trailing edge seam.

,

403

I?A.BBIC L?ASTENINQS.

A sample of fabric doped and painted taken from trailing edge of plane was tested by
passing the fabric around a &inch rod and clamping the two ends in the pulling clamps of the
testing machine. The middle of the pasted joint was directly over the rod. The speed of
tedng was 6 inches per minute. The specimens ware + inch wide.
The tensile strength of the doped fabric was 247 pounds per 1+ inches.
The pasted joint of the pasted seam gave way.
Further tasta in the same manner were conducted on grade A cotton and grade A linen.
Samples were prepared in the following manner for both grades.
i
1. Samples were folded back} butted against each other, and sewed with a “baseball”
stitch of linen thread approxirnatdy 30 lea. The stitches w~e ~ inch apart. These were made
over a false trailing edge and doped with two coats of dope. The frayed surface tape was put
on with the third coat and later a fourth coat added. The warp of the fabric was perpendicular
to trailing edge.
Z. Samplw were prepared by lapping the fabric over a false trailing edge with 1 inch +
overlap. This was pasted with the &ah chat of dope. The surface tape was put on with the
third coat and a fourth added. The warp of the fabric was perpendicular to trailing edge.
3. The surface tape was prepared by cutting the material 2* inches wide and raveling
~ inch on each tide. Tape with the warp parallel to its length and with filling parallel to its
length was prepared. The usual method with the warp parallel to its length is put on the
trailing edge such that the Ming of the tape is parallel to the warp of the wing fabric. The
filIing tape has the warp parahl to the warp of the wing fabric.

k view of the fact that the strength of the pasted joint is much lower than the strength
of the sewed joint, it is concluded that this method of fastening is not good. This difhrence
would probably be emphasized if the dope deteriorated. k the case of the pasted seam the
number of tacks left in would proportionatcdy increase its resistance to approximately equal
the strength of the sewed seam with a numbar of tacks equal to the number of stitchM.
For training planes, which are painted with light protecting medium aud in which the
stress= of flight are low, the pasted method would be satisfactory.
The effect of the properties of the surface tape as i.nfhmncing the strength of the joint is
interwting. JR the case of the ps9ted joint, a tape the warp of which is parallel to the warp of
the wing fabric materially reduces the shearing action on the dope paste between the tape and
the fabric and consequently increas- the strength of the joint.
In the c=e of the sewed seam, a tape the warp of which is p=allel to the warp of the wing
covering reduce9 the strength of the joint. This is probably due to the fact that more of the
load is carried by the stitchings, due ta the excessive stretch of the warp of the tape at any
load as compared to the stretch of the filling.

SUMMARY.

For a sewed joint, at the trailing edge, of straightaway fabrics, the warp of the tapa should
be parallel to trailing edge.
For a pastsd joint, of similar use, the ~ng of the tape should be parallel to trailing edge
-to obtain the best r&ndts.
The above awum& that
the warp of the tape has
much more stretch thw the
filling.
From this it might. IJOassumed that a bias joinL should
be covered with a bias surface

AIRPLANE FABRIC SEAMS.

In covering the wings of
a phme, it is necessary to sew
several widths of the fabric
together to obtain therequired
width. The seams havinglcss
stretch than the fabric will
under certain conditions of
strew carry the major portion of the load and consequently must be proportionately stronger.
The three important factors to be considered in determining the strongest typo of
seam applicable for this purpose are, first, the method of
&erlapping the edges of the
cloth; second, the strength of
the sewing thread; and third,
the number of stitches per
inch.
With the availab~esowing
machines there are six ways
in which the cloth may be cndapped, which are shown in figure 1.
The tensile strength of the sea-mwas determined by means of an inclination balance type
of testing machine. The seam was approximately midway between the clamps and perpendicular to the line of strws. Clamps were I inch wide and the distance between clamps was 1 inch
The rate of sepmation of the clamps was 12 inches per minute.

bother method whid has met with some success has been to sew reinforcing tape on the
surface of the fabric pamlkd to the warp aud tilling so that squares of about 8 inches were
formed.
To determine the sixongest type of reinforcing tape the following tests were made:
This method may be cofidered as an attempt-to approximate a shock tear. The cloth
was stretched on a light, wooden, rectangular frame under enough tension to take out the
wrinkles and was suspended from a spring baknca. A square 2 inches on a side was marked
near the top of the frame. Threa sides of the square were cut and the piece allowed to hang
down. A 60-pound weight was attached to the hanging strip and the fabric caused to tear
by reason of the weight dropping. The force transmitted by the tearing fabric, as shown by
the deflection of the spring balance, was plotted autographically against the motion of the
fabg
weight.
The warp wee in the perpendicular or horizontal position, depending upon which system
of threads was being torn. The cutmtrip was allowed to hang down on the seam side of the
fabric and over the side of the fabric having no seam.
The second method was a modification of the first, in that the same procedure was followed
with the exception that the tearing was induced by placing the material between the cIamps
of the conventional type for tensile strength testing. The lower clamp moved at the rate of 5
inchas per minute.
This method is believed to be more nearly indicative of the actual performanw of the
fabric.
The fabric was clamped in the circular container 30 centimeters in diameter with t-he
fabric free to deflect by reason of applied air pressure.
The material was strwsed to very nearIy its bursting pressure and a cut made at the center
point, which started a tear. The directions and lengths of the tsars were noted.
Kinds of reinforcing tested were:
Sample A.+%raight seam (tape), parallel to warp and-filling.
Sample B.—Bias tape, parallel to warp and fig.
Sample C.--straight tape, bias to warp and i311ing.
Sample D.—Bias tape, bias to warp and M@;
Resultsof tewk-When
the cut stripwas allowed to hang cwer the side of the fabrichaving
no’ tape (seam) and the fabric term according to methods one and two, the tiect of the tape
or seam was not noticeable.
Tn the case of allowing the cut strip to hang down over the seam and tearing according to
the first method, the fabric tire to the tape and then followed the stitching of the tape until
the strip tore off.
Sample A.—The tear started in the direction of filhg and across the warp ends, tore down
to the reinforcing tape, broke the sthhes holding the tape and continued. The tear acr~
the fiIling ends acted in the same manner.
Sample B.—The tear across the warp ends tore to reinforcing tape and then followed the
tape until the strip tore off. The tear across the HIing ends tore to the tape reinforcing, broke
the stitches and then continued.
Sample C.—The tear across both warp and filling ends tow tu the tape, broke the stitches
and continued.
Sample D.—The tear across both warp and falling ends tore to the reinforcing tape Lhcn
followed the stitches until the strip tore off.
The sample B..with bi~ reinforcing tape sewed parallel ta warp and filling gave the best
resuhe se the load required to tear the strip off at the reinforcing was slightly greater than in
any of the other methods of reirdorcing.
The results of tearing by these methods are as follows:
Sample A.—Tear ran through seam.
Sample B.—Tear stopped at tape (seam).
Sample C.—Tear ran under seam when intersection of two sean~ \vereat center of clamped
fabric.

BALLOON FABRIC SEAMS.

The Bureau of Standards, in cooperation with the joint Army and Navy Aircraft Board,
have been experimenting with varioue methods of making seams in the envelopes of balloons,
the desired object being a seam having the necessary strength and gas tightness and having
the minimum w~~ht. This report deals with the stren=ti of the seams.
The sampks tested were made by the B. F. Goodrich Co., and the Goodyear Tire& Rubber
Co., each company furnishing—
Samples of ihished fabric without seams.
SampIee of seams stitched and cemented, but not taped.
Samples of seams cemented and taped but not stitched.
Samples of seams cemented, taped, and stitched.
The samples submitted were two-ply fabric, one ply biased at approximately 45° to the
other.
The fabrics were overlapped $ inch in all cases, and when sewed had two paraliel lines of
stitches approximately ~ inch apart.
The Goodrich seams were sewed with silk sewing thread, five stitches to the inch, on a
hck-stitch machine. The tape used to cover one side of. the seam was straight. and 2 inches
wide. The tape used to cover the reverse side of the seam was straight and Ii inches wide.
The Goodyear seams were sewed ~ith cotton sewing thread, seven stitches ta the inch,
un a chain-stitch machine. The tape used to, cover both sides of the seam were bias and 1#
inches wide.
%&hod of ted—
L Samples of each fabric and the several different seams were tested and determinations
of the bursting properties were made.
2. Strips of the plain fabric 2 by 6 inches were cut paralIel to the warp and filling of each
ply of cloth and the tensiIe strength determined.
3. Strips with the seam in the center were cut 3 by 6 inches, the long side of the strip parallel
to the seam and the tensile strength determined.
4. Samples of the sewing thread were $ested and determination of the tensile strength
were made.
Bursting tek-The
fabric wcs placed under the annular ring of the bursting apparatus
with the center of the seam coinciding with a diameter of the ring and the fabric subjected to a
uniforndy increasing air pressure. The deflection at the central point of the fabric m seam
was plotted autographicaliy @nst
the pressure necessary to produce the deflection. A rubber
diaphram was used under the fabric to prevent leakage of air.
TenAle strength tests.—The strips cut in methods 2 and 3 were piaced ih the clamps of a
wnventionai inclination balance type of testing machine with 3 inches between clamps and
the strips were caused to rupture by separat~w the clamps at a rate of 12 inches per minute.
The sewing thread was broken on a conventional inclination bahince type of testing machine
with 6 inches between jaws.
resuhs of the determination of bursting tests.are shown in Table I.
Reauh of tesk—The
The results of the determination of tensile strength tests ORthe strips are shown in Table II.
The reeults of the determination of tensile strength tests on the sewing thread are shown
in Table III.
Value of ttw%.—The burnt@ tests show the behavior of “the material when it is subjected
to a uniformly distributed pressure and can, therefore, be taken w a laboratory method of
determining the behavior of the fabric w seam when the material is used in m inflated spherical

FOR AERONAUTICS.

The deflection at any pressure shows the degree of tautness of the fabric or seam and tho
pressure necessary to rupture the fabric or scam may bc used as a valuable index to the factor
of safety.
The tcmsilestrength teets on the fabric show the strength of individual cloths which make
up the finished fabric.
The tensile strength teats on the seams show the amount of strwis necessary to rupturo
the seam.
—Table I shows tho average results of the bumting tests on tlm fabrk
Di.acwsion of rewdt.s.
and seams.
The d
size of the Goodyear plain fabric samplw precluded a satisfactory bursting test
and the result shown is not believed to be a fair measur~ of their ability to resist pressure. Thc
results of the bursting test would indicate that the Goodrich seam is stronger than the Goodyear.
This may be due to the slightly higher tensile strength of the Goodrich fabric and to the wider
tape used in covering the Goodrich, seams.
The dMerence between the surface tension in the seams which were cemented and stitched
and the surface tension in the plain fabric would indicate that stitching had weakened the fabric.
The slight difference between the surface tion
of the cemented and taped seam and tho
cemented, taped, and stitched seam of the Goodyear fabric would indicate that the stitching
added very little strength to the seam. A comparison of the corresponding data on the Goodrich
seam would indioate that the stitohing added strength.
Table II givee the average results of the determinations of the tensile strength of the plain
fabric per inch width, the average tensile strength of the seams, the weight in ounces per square
yard of plain fabric, and the weight in ounces per linear yard of the seams.
A comparison of the tensile strengths of the fabri~ shows the Goodrich fabric to be sfight.ly
stronger than the Goodyear fabric.
In strwsing the Goodyear cemented and taped seam, also the cemented, taped, and stitched
seam, the seams gave way at 127 pounds and 175 pounds, xwpectively, after which the fabric
on either side of the seam carried the load. The fial rupture point is shown in Table II.
It is not Lhought that the final rupture point should be considered in comparing tho rmulta
of the two makw of seams, as the mam itself had ruptured previous to tlus point.
