TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.

Readers of the translation herewith presented, possessmg some
acquaintance with the construction of dirigibles, will probably find
that some of the technical German terms have not been rendered
by their technical English equivalents. It is hoped that the result
is in no case misleading; a few instances, however, are here cited:
Prallballon, signifying a balloon in which the excess pressure
is always high enough to keep the fabric tense, is translated
Fadenschiebung, Fadendehnung, Fadenstreckung, which are defined on
paa-e 156 and seem to have been devised by the authors, are translated
as literally as possible; paraZlel-doubliett, diagonal-doubliert, are carried over without change into the English, definition for these also
being given. Innere R eibung is given as "viscosity." A few explanatory notes have been added in the first 30 pages, at points where
the development seemed difficult to follow, and might have become
more so in the translation.
The distinction between the modes of suspension of the cars known
as Se'iltakelung (the common scheme) and as Stoffbahnaufhiingung
(the scheme employed by the Siemens-Schuckert company) is
explained in articles by Krell in the Z eitschrift fur Flugtechnik und
Motor-Luftschiffahrt, volume 2, 1911, the readmg of which might
be recommended as a preface to the work here presented. The Stoffbahnaufhdngung, as there described, consists of two Iona- strips of
fabric, each sewed to the h ull along one of the long edges; the two are
parallel throughout the greater part of their lengths, but are brought
together in front and behind, like the sides of a ship at the bow;
the cars are suspended from these strips.
The Amme (p. 268) is, according to Vorreiter's Jahrbuch uber die
Fortschritte der Luftsch~fffahrt, 1911, page 258, a bag which, when
the balloon is in the 'hall, is connected with it by a rubb er tube; the
two contain hydrogen, and when the pressure in the system goes
down, it is raised again by piling sand-bags on the nurse balloons.
In one place the translator has failed to grasp the meaning of a
phrase (p. 198, bottom) and there are some places, in the descriptions of the experimental set-ups, where the proper words or names
for the auxiliary apparatus (clamps, screws, etc.) h ave not, perha.ps,
been found. It is believed that none of the phrases involved is of the
first importance. In all such cases, and wherever there seemed to
be any possibility of doubt, the original word has been inserted.
Two places where misprints seem to have been made in the original
(pp. 167 and 206) are mdicated in footnotes.

PREFACE.
The technical requirements imposed upon the envelope of a free
balloon are simply that it be gas-tight, strong, light in weight, and
that it be able to resist mechanical stresses and atmospherIc influences. The shape of the envelope, however, is not of importance,
and in gene!'}.l it makes no difference if the shape changes under the
influence of the tensions in the fabric. The same is true of the gasbags of rigid airships, which similarly serve only to receive and to
preserve the gas. On the other hand, the envelopes of semirigid and
nonrigid airships are required, not merely to contain the gas, but also
to maintain their initial form, which is necessary for the operation
of the airship, in opposition to bending and shearing forces.
Every applied force causes a deformation. So long as the deformation does not impede the operation of the ship, it may be ignored.
This is usually possible when the ratio of length to breadth (of the
envelope) is small. As this ratio increases, the bending and shearing
forces, partly resulting from the load, partly appearing only when
the ship is in motion, increase; the shearinK forces appearing especially when the airship is moving rapidly. The limit beyond which
the deformation is no longer tolerable is then easily r eached and
passed. This was the case with the trial airship of the SiemensSchuckert Works. It became apparent in the early weeks after the
filling, and later on during the voyages, how advantageous, and indeed
how necessary, it would be to have an exact knowledge of the properties of the fabric, in order to plan the shape of the envelope. The
followino- study attempts to repair this omi sion.
The ad;inistration of the Siemens-Schuckert works merits special
thanks for the readiness with which they made possible the very
interesting investigations, here to be described, for the sake of airsbip
construction in general, inasmuch as the results obtained could no
longer be of use for their own t rial airship. In particular, the authors are especially indebted to Director Otto Krell, of the division
of war and naval construction of the Siemens-Schuckert Works,
for the keen interest and the extensive support which he afforded the
present work.
The results, which have turned out to be indispensable in the construction of such long and slender balloons, can also be of use wherever
balloon fabric is employed, whether subjected to forces or used for
transmitting forces. The constructor, to whom the importance of
a knowledge of the deformation of iron and steel under force is sel£evident, will wish to acquire the same knowledge about balloon fabric.
Systematic investigations in this direction are the concern of the firms
making fabric. If their descriptions contain, together with information about price, weight, strength, and gas-tightness, information
about the deformation properties, the task of the constructor will be
lightened, the danger of failures diminished, and the demand for
fabric increased.

THE ENVELOPE.

INTRODUCTION: BENDING OF THE ENVELOPE, CORRECTION, PREVEN·
TION.

The envelopes of nonrigid and semirigid airships as designed are, as a
rule, surfaces of revolution. The strips of fabric are cut out in such
a manner, that the axis of this surface of r evolution is a straight line.
Very slight deviations from straightness, su ch as are caused by irregularities m marking out, cutting out, and gluing together the stnps
of fabric, are of no practical importance.
When the envelope is filled with gas and equipped, it enters into a
state of load, due partly to the internal pressure, partly to its own
weight, and to the attached weights. The pressure and the weights
produce bending and shearing stresses; under the influence of these
stresses, the axis of the envelope, previously straight, begins to curve;
the back sinks in, while h ead and tail are bent upward.
This process is of the nature of a gradual flow. It continu es for
days, making an asymptotic approach to a limit, which, taking into
account the length of life of the envelope, m ay be regarded as perman ent.
As the deformation of balloon fabrics is very considerable in comparison with that of the materials employed in machinery, the bendmg of the envelope as a rule requires correction.
The nature of this correction depends upon the construction of the
ship. When there is a rope suspension (Seiltakelung)-i. e., when
the suspended weights are attached to a girdle, sewed to the envelope,
by means of a number of ropes, applied at a number of different
points on the girdle-the envelope after being filled can be pulled back
mto its original form (at least in the vicinity of the girdle) bylengthening or shortening individual ropes. The availability of this method
is, however, limited, less because the load is then no longer distributed
uniformly along the girdle, than b ecause of the d anger that the
tension on the underside of the envelope may be completely annulled
so that folds will appear. When the suspended weights are attached
to a strip of fabric (Sto.f!bahnaufhiingung) the shape of the envelope can
not be altered after the filling. Consequently, if allowance was not

made beforehand for the deformation, it is necessary to insert wedgeshaped pieces of fabric into the envelope, thus losing the gas of the
firs t fillill g .
It seems desirable to form a conception of the deformation to be
expected while the envelope is being constructed, and to give a negatIve curvature to the axi of the envelope, so that it becomes straight
(asisneces aryin order to reach the maximum speed and to steer upward) only after the load is applied. To do this, it is necessary first
to be acquainted with the properties of the fabric.
A. THE STRETCHING OF BALLOON FABRIC.
THE SINGLE LAYER.

The fabric at present employed in making balloons consists of two
or three layers of cotton cloth, gummed together either so that threads
of adjacent layers are parallel (parallel doublin~,. Paralleldoublirung)
or so that they are not :parallel (diagonal doubting, DiagonaldoubLirung) . The single layer IS woven from two sy tems of threads, warp
and woof, which intersect at a definite ang1e, usually 90 0 • When
subjected to force::>, this network undergoes three kinds of deform a-

tion, which arc due to different and independent causes, but in certain
cases affect one another.
In figure 1 a force P is applied to a tensed piece of fabric. The
action IS as follows:
Since the rectangular meshes contain no diagonals, the fabric first
goes over into the configuration of figure 2. This we call thread shear
(Fadenschiebung) .
Since the thread is bent into a wavy curve (because it passes alternately over and under threads of the other system) it tends to
straighten out. This we call thread straightening (Fadenstreckung ).
Since the straightened thread is itself elongated, the fabric undergoes a lenghtenin~of a third kind parallel to the force. This we call
thread extension (Jladendehnung).
THREAD SHEAR.

Thread shear is the change in the angles of a four-cornered mesh.
The most general case of load is shown ill figure 4. Imagine a small
rectangular piece of the fabric, of length a and breadth b, in which
act the tensions 0"1 and 0"2' The rectangle includes a certain number,
nu of threads parallel to one direction, and a certain number, n 2 ,
equal to or different from nil of threads parallel to another direction ;

in the figure, n l = n z = 4. Let the force along each thread of the first
system, due to CJ l1 be represented by P l1 that due to CJ z bY' P z, the
resultant of P l1 and P z by R I ; similarly, the forces on each thread
of the second system, due to CJ1 and CJ z, are represented by X P s and
p., their resultant by Hz. HI and Hz will not, in gener al, be parallel
to the initial directions of the threads. (In the diagram, these
forces are shown only for one thread of each system, and only in one
sense. At the other end of each thread equal and oppositely directed
forces are obviously to be applied. )
Since the mesh opposes no r esistance to chan~.e of angle, equilibrium will be attamed only when the threads lie p arallel to the
forces acting upon them.. The r ectangle of fabric depicted in figure
4 is thus converted into the p arallelogram of figure 5.

Let a. and {3 represent the angles between the directions of the

According to this equation :
1. The number of threads per unit breadth is immaterial; the
thread shear is the same whether or not the warp and woof are
equally dense.
2. The strength of the threads is immaterial; the thread shear is
not affected by differences in quality between warp and woof.
3. The absolute magnitudes of the tensions are immaterial; the
thread shear is determrned exclusively by their ratio.
Equation (1) is satisfied by infinitely many parallelograms. To
every' angle a corresponds an angle {3, for which equilibrium exists.
A second condition IS required to determine the equilibrium shape
uniCJ.uely. This is given by the mode of insertion of the element of
fabrIc (Einspannung des Stoffelementes in seiner Umgebung).
In figures 6 and 7 we see the mesh, in its initial rectangular form and
after deformation, as it lies upon the surface of a cylindrical envelope.
The second condition is that two points, A and B, lying originally on
one and the same normal cross section of the envelope, lie after the
deformation on one and the same cross section (not necessarily the

Now, equations (1) and (2) determine a and {3 in terms of the ratio
of the tensions and the initial angle "/. The computation of values
may here be omitted. Figures 8 and 9 represent a and {3, graphed
in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates as functions of "/ and
u2 /ul' The following points are to be noted:
1. The surfaces are mirror images of one another, for to each value
of"/ between 0° and 45° corresponds another between 45° and 90°,
for which the load case is symmetrical (i. e., if we replace "/ by 90°
-"/ the angles a and (3 interchange vaiues.-Transl.).
2. If one of the tensions is zero, both a and {3 become 90°-i. e.,
the other tension draws the rectangle out into a straight line.

3. There is no thread shear when the fabric (i. e., warp or woof)
is parallel to the axis of the enV'elope. For, for "I = 0 we have a = 0, {3 =

EXTENSION OF DIAMETER, SHORTENTNG OF LENGTH, AND TWISTll~G
OF THE ENVELOPE RESULTING FROM THREAD SHEAR.

In thread shear the constructor is concerned not with the angles

of the envelope.

The :first consequence is an extension of the diameter. It is expressed by a factor d/do, representing the ratio of the final to the
mitial diameter. (Figs. 6 and 7.) It is computed as follows:

The second consequence of thread shear is a diminution in length.
It is measured by a factor 1/10, representing the ratio o~ the final to
the initial length of the envelope rmg (Hiillenring) . It IS computed
as follows:

The percentage decrease in length is

The third consequence of thread shear is a twisting of the envelope.
It is measured by the angle of shear cp (fig. 7), of which the tangent
is computed as follows:

making these substitutions,
tancp = _l_(sina - sin{3'sin'Y'cos'Y - sina ·sinz'Y).
COSa

These equations give l1d, l1Z, and cp in terms of a, {3, '1, whence by
means of figures 8 and 9 we may express them in terms of '1 and rJZ/rJ 1 ;
the corresponding graphs are shown in figures 10-12.
They show first, t h at for '1=0° or ,),=90°, thread shear J?roduces
neither increase in diameter, diminution in length, nor tWIsting of
the hull. The same is the case when the two tensions are equal.
When the fabric lies diagonally ('1 = 45 0) there is no twisting, but the
increase in diameter and dimunition in length reach their largest
values. For all values of '1 between 45° and either 0° or 90° we have
change in diameter and in length, and in addition a twisting, which
is positive or negative according as 'Y is greater or less than 45°.
The surfaces graphed give quantitatively correct results only for
an ideal n etwork which can be deformed at will. In reality the
thread shear is limited by the narrowness of the meshes. The point
where this limit enters in is to be found by experiment. For the
theory of thread shear, it is sufficient to understand its nature and
its order of magnitude.
THREAD STRAIGHTENING! (FADENSTRECKUNG) .

Thread straightening results from the interactions between the
interwound threads of warp and woof. The circumstances are more
complicated than in thread shear. We therefore consider only t he
case which is simplest and, at the same time, most important-that
in which the tensions are parallel to the threads (of warp and woof,
respectively), i . e., '1=0°; and we further assume that the threads
have an invariable cu:cular cross section, a central axis of invariable
length, and an indefinitely high flexibility without resistallce to
bending.
'The German word means literally "thread stretching," but the idea is that of Ii crooked thread drawn
out into a straight line.

This equation corresponds in form to equation (1) page 159, for
thread shenr. It states fust1. That the thread straightening depends on the number of threads
per unit breadth.
2. That it do es not depend upon the diameter of the threads.
3. That it docs not depend upon the absolute magnitudes of the
tensions, but only upon their ratio.
Like equation (1), equation (3) is satisfied by infini tely many pairs
of angles e and t; a further equation is required in order to make the
solution unique. This is given in terms of the diameter I of thread,
0, and the distances Sl and S2' designated as" till-ead lengths," between
pairs of crossing points KIK~) or ~K~, measured along the invariable
central axis.
We have

Between the two" wave heights" U 1 and U 2 we h a,e the relationship
+ U 2 = 20. This is most easily seen, if we first imagine one of the
threads to be perfectly straight; in this case the wave height is
obviously the sum of the diameter (double the diameter of either).
If now we impart to the straight thread a wave height of any amount
Ut> the wave height of the other thread diminishes by the same
amount, so that the sum remains constant.
Therefore, 20' cose + sine(2o'e - Sl) + 20'cost + sint(2o vi t - S2) = 20

There is no upper limit to the possible values of Sl and S2; the greater
the thread lengths, the broader the meshes of the fabric. But a
lower limit is imposed by the volume of the threads; this is found by
a special consideration. Two cases are to be distinguished:

the waves are low (i. e., if the perpendicular distance from crest to
trough is small, in which case the meshes are wide and the quantity
8/0 large) changes in the ratio of tensions U2/U 1 have only a slight effect
on the angles. If the meshes are narrower (s/o smaller) the waves
are higher and the change produced by a given change in tension
ratio is greater (so stdgen die WelZenhOhen und damit auch ihr Veranderungsbereich). Finally, if the meshes are so narrow that consecutive threads of either system, warp or woof, come into contact with
one another (this begins to happen at 8 = 71"0) the effect produced by
any change in tension ratio diminishes again, and finally vanishes
completely at 8 = ~7l'0 where the fabric is perfectly continuous (consecutive threads of either system lie in contact without any interspace); the necessity that the threads shall have room in which to
lie abolishes all freedom of motion.

INCREASE IN DIAMETER AND DECREASE IN LENGTH OF ENVELOPE DUE

As in the case of thread shear, the builder is interested not in the
values of the angles E and r for themselves, but in the influence of
thread straightening for the shape of the envelope. We retain the
assumption that the fabric lies parallel to the axis (hence the tensions
parallel to the threads); then thread straightening reveals itself only
in two effects as against the three in which thread shear appearsin an increase in the diameter and a decrease in the lengtli of the

of thread straightening, as previously explained, is here clearly to
be seen; the deformation is very slight for wide meshes, increases
gradually with decreasing breadth of mesh and, after passing through
a maximum, diminishes rapidly to zero.

166

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
THREAD EXTENSION.

Under the term thread extension we include all changes in the
shape and size of the thread itself. Under the influence of the
forces acting on the thread, its length increases; simultaneously its
diameter decreases, partly because the individual filaments of which
it is made contract, but also because they draw more closely together
within the thread. Finally, the cross-section of the thread, which
we regard as approximately circular, becomes more or less flattened
out at the points of intersection (with the threads of the other
system).
Thread extension is inaccessible to theoretical treatment. It
inevitably accompanies thread shear and thread straightening when..:
ever the fabric is subjected to stresses.
THE RESULTANT DEFORMATIONS.

By resultant deformation we mean the combination of the three
individual deformations just described.
If the fabric (warp or woof) is parallel to the axis of the envelope,
and if the tension ratio happens to correspond to the ratio of the relative thread lengths sJo and S2/0 so that equations (3) and (4) (p.
162) are initially satisfied, there is neither thread shear nor thread
straightening, and the resultant deformation is due entirely to
thread extension. If the fabric is not parallel to the axis, thread
shear appears, and if the ratio of tension is not as just stated, thread
straightening appears. In the general case, all three are present.
The following consideration will show that, when these deformations exist together, they are not entirely independent of one another
(i. e., the change in form due to two working together is not necessarily the sum of those due to the two separately).
The two equations for thread shear are
tana ·tan{3=o)IT2
(1)
and
COSa

cos{3 = cot-y
(2)
The :first states that the threads must set theInselves in the direction of the resultant of the applied forces. Obviously it continues
to hold good when thread straightening appears. Equation (2)
expresses a relation between a and fJ which depends on the initial
values m and b, hence also on 11 and 12 (Cf. fig . 6 and fig. 14). Now
the quantities il and 12 are altered by thread straightening, so that
equation (2) should be replaced by an equation of the form
COSa

where x is a function of the thread straightening. This is especially
important for -y=45°, where

so that thread straightening may indirectly produce a twisting of
the envelope which was not to be expected from the study of thread
shear. We shall frequently recur to this phenomenon, which is
disagreeable in the construction of envelopes.

DEFORMATION.

According to equations (1) and (3) (pp . 159 and 162) the thread
shear and thread straightening are determined by the ratio of the
tensions, not by their absolute magnitude. This fact leads to the
following consequences :
1. Any ten ions, no matter how small, produce the unique corresponding deformation in its full amount.
2. The deformation takes place without the performance of any
work, and is not reversed by any internal forces in the fabric when
the load is removed.
3. There is no particular shape (length, breadth) of the fabric
corresponding to absence of tension.
We see that the equations are to be limited in their application.
They are based upon the unfulfilled hypothesis that the fabric is entirely devoid of elasticity. As a matter of fact, the thread possesses a distinct, though small, elasticity, which opposes a resistance
to the lengthening, compression, or bending of the thread, this resistance increasing with the amount of the deformation.
To this must be added the effect of the rubberization (Gummierung).
The rubber which is squeezed in among the threads, and the layer of
rubber which is spread out over the fabric acts with regard to thread
shear as would a spring parallel to the diagonal of the m esh (als
fede:rnde Diagonale) and with regard to thread-straightening and
thread-extension as would springs parallel to the threads themselves
(als federnde V e:rstarkung) .tal~ng a definit~ though small par.t of
the load off the threads (dM d~e Faden zu ~nem wenn auch kle'm em
Teil entlastet).
It is therefore to be expected that the fabric will undergo considerable deformation even when the load is small, since it is restrained only by the elasticity of the threads and by the rubber.
The greater the load the more slo~1Y will the deformation approach
its tlieoretical maximum value. When the load is removed the elasticity of the threads and the rubber will strive to reverse the deformation.

This is possibly a misprint for a and /'I.-Trans!.

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
VISCOSITY (INTERNAL FRIOTION) .

The thread substance (Fasermaterial) of the fabric possesses a
high viscosity. The consequence of this is that the deformation
does not attain the amount depicted in curve I (fig. 20), but falls
short of it by a certain amount, positive during the loading, negative during the unloading (curves II, III). Thelermanent alteration in form observe after the unload1h~l'ttica~ IimiliDg va~._ ing is complete corresponds to equilibrium between the elastic forces and the
viscosity. The process is the same as
in the materials used in machinery, but
in this case it apt:;s practically only
after the elastic . .t is passed, while
in the case of balloon fabrics it appears no matter how small the load.
Balloon fabric is always in the state of
plasticity.
Viscosity is due to the combined action of a great number of resistances,
FlO. 20.
which are individually inaccessible to
measurement. We can imagine it as
due to a kind of felting. This conception would explain why the
vicosity changes, within certain limits, during the process of deformation, and why the state of equilibrium is not immediately and
permanently reached, so that every deformation requires a certain
amount of time to become complete.
EXPERIMENTS.

The experiments described in this pamphlet were carried out in
the revolving balloon hall of the Siemens-Schuckert factory, and were
distributed according to opportunity over the first half of 1912.
The experimental arrangements were simple. It was possible to
dispense with special machinery and apparatus for making measurements of high accuracy, because of the magnitude of the deformations to be measured. For example, measurements of length were
ordinarily made with a narrow, flexible celluloid rule divided into
millimeters, tenths of millimeters being estimated. The loads were
standard weights and, principally, sandbags which had been weighed.
The choice of fabncs subjected to experiment was princi})ally
determined by the stock of the repair shop ill the balloon hall. Only
a few samples were specially ordered for the tests from the firm of
Riedinger ill Augsburg.
The description of the experiments is confined to a short exposition of the experimentnl set-up and a graphic presentation of the
results; all intermediate computations are omitted.
To facilitate the inspection of the results, the tests are numbered
in Roman numerals. FUl'thermore, a t able of materials is added at
the end of this paper in which all the materials subjected to tests are
briefly described and designated with letters.

FIGs. 21-22.-Test I, slowncss of deformation. (Fig. 21 (top), fabric F, parallel doubling; fig. 22 (bottom),

Two similar strips were lo aded with loads of 400 kg. per meter,
not all at once, but in four steps (100, 200, 300, 400) at intervals of 24
hours.
The readings were continued over four weeks, after which the
unlo ading began, with the first two strips all at once, with the last
two in four steps (300, 200, 100, 0).
The percentage elongations observed are shown as functions of
time in figures 21-22. The first point upon each curve or each arc
opposite which the amount of lo ad is written is the point obtained
one minute after the load was applied (or removed) ; the second point

is the point observed two hours later; the third point is the one observed 24 hours later. From that point on the elongation increases
only at a slow rate. It reaches its final value some 14 days after the
load is applied, but the contraction after unloading requires at lea t
four weeks. Small undulations in the curves (such as those marked
with a) are to be ascribed to considerable variations in temperature
and dampness of the air. The exact relationship between deformation and these influences is neglected here, as in aU the other tests.
Subsequently to the unloading it becomes clear how small the
elastic forces are in comparison to the viscosity. The contraction of
the strips, especially in the step-by-step unloading, is sometimes too
small to measure. For the same cause, the permanent set (elongation) is very large, some 5! per cent.
TEST n .-RELATION BETWEEN TENSION" AND DEFORMATION.

(Materials A, B, C, D of the table.)

Three normal strips of each material were extended to the point of
rupture by uniform increase of load: one parallel to the warp one
parallel to the woof, one diagonally at an angle of 45° (with either
warp or woof) . The additions to the load were made at short intervals (about one minute) and were of 20 to 50 kg. per meter, according
to the need for accuracy. The readings were taken about one-half
minute after each augmentation of load, the elongation by measuring over a length of 200 rom. (Messlange) and the breadth diminution by measuring over a breadth equal to the breadth of the strip,
50mm.
The observations are graphed as functions of the specific load
(kg. per meter) in figures 23-26. The individual points are plotted
only in the first diagram, so as to give an idea of the accuracy of the
curve.
The tension is here defined as the quotient of the applied load by
the initial breadth (50 mn1.), not by the actual (lesser) breadth at
the time the load is completely applied. This is the procedure in the
investi~ations of strain in the construction of machinery. SUlce, however, the deformations of these fabrics are immensely greater, it is
desirable to make a correction in more exact computations (see
below, p . 208).
The experimental curves are of the kind predicted in fiQUl'e 20, and
thus depart considerably from Hooke's law of proportion;)'ity between
stress and strain. The stresses arisin~ in practice do not ordinarily
exceed those corresponding to the irntial rapidly rising part of the
curve.
The direction of the applied foree is of decisive importance; all the
tests show the following phenomenon : the elongation of the warp is
different from that of the woof, and both are considerably exceeded
by that along the diagonals. In figUl'e 27 this difference is shown by
the different lengths of the three sample strips under the same load.
The difference between warp and woof is a consequence of tbre d
straightening, and can result only from inequality of the wave heights
of warp and woof, so that the assumption made in fiO"ures 17-19
(pp. 164-166)-i. e., that the initial wave heigbts are equcl (Sl =S2 and

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

171

.I)-can not be true. In the process of preparing the fabric there
are two stages at which such inequalities might be introduced:
1. In the loom, the motions and the forces undergone by the warp
and the woof are entirely different.
2. In the process of rubberization, the fabric is unrolled from one
roll and rolled over another under a certain tension, and is thus extended parallel to the warp and contracted parallel to the woof. A
part of this deformation is permanent. Hence one and the same
fabric will possess a different initial value of the thread straightening
after the rubberization from what it did before.
To what extent this phenomenon, which is entirely disadvantageous in the construction of balloons, is taken into account by the
firms making fabrics could not be ascertained. Inquiries about this
matter were made, but information was withheld by the firms .
Figures 23-24, relating to one and the same fabric, show the influence of rubberization; the elongation parallel to the woof (Schuss),
which is the lesser of the two in the uurubberized state, is nearly
double that parallel to the warp in the rubberi.zed state. Similarly,
in the rubberized fabrics of figures 25-26 the woof elongation is the
greater (note especially fabric C); to it corresponds invariably
greater contraction parallel to the warp .
In this connection, reference should be made to the following observation: A series of strips was not submitted to investigation till a
few weeks, in some cases even some months, after they were prepared
Ci. e., cut out and marked), since the operation of the SiemensSchuckert balloons often consUIDed all the available time. Dming
this time the len~ths which had been marked out with fine India-ink
lines upon the fabric parallel to the warp diminished by about t to 1
per cent. This is most easily explained by a previous tension of
the warp threads dming the manufactme.
The great differences between the extensibilities of warp and woof
indicate that the values of the relative thread length s/o should in
practice be chosen between hand 71, where the surfaces of fiames 18
and] 9 (p. 166) have sharp slopes. Quantitative comparisons tetween
experiment and the theory of figmes 18 and 19 are rendered impossible by the uncertainty in the initial values and by the simplifications introduced into the hypotheses of the theory.
The large deformations produced by diagonally applied load reveal
the action of thread shear. Since the normal strips are loaded only
in a direction parallel to the length, not perpendicularly thereto,
the tension ratio (J2/(Jl is zero, and as theoretical limiting values we
should expect 41.4 per cent for the elongation and 100 per cent for
the contraction in breadth. As to the elongation, the observed
maxima are i..n, good agreement with theory. In some cases it goes
somewhat above 41.4 per cent because of thread extension. For
lesser tensions, the restriction of figme 20 is operative. As to the
lateral contraction, there is a difference of about 45 per cent between
theory and experiment. This is due to the space reqwi.rement of the
threads, which brings about that a+f3, the angle between warp and
woof, can not become zero. This angle is the sharp angle seen III the
three rhombs discerned one above the other in the right-hand strip
in figme 27. It may be computed from the elongation and the
lateral contraction, and is plotted in figmes 23-26.

The contribution of thread extension to the total deformation in
the diagonal clirection is to be ascertained as follows: If we apply the
measured extension m and lateral contraction n to the equal sides,
drawn of unit length, of a right-angled isosceles triangle, the hypotenuse DE of the new triangle (see fig . 24) represents the thread
length, into which the original thread length B Ohas been transformed.
The difference between the two is pure thread extension. Its magnitude is .J (1 +m)2 + (1 - n)2 - -/2. It is represented in figure 24, in
which it reaches the maximum value 5.8 per cent.
It should be noted that, in general, the values for the deformation
graphed in figures 23-26, being obtained after the load had been
applied for a short time, are smaller than those that would be found
in the case of a balloon envelope permanently under stress.
~e values of the ultimate strength (~tr~ss ca~sing rupture) are of
less nnportance for the purposes of thIS InVestIgatIOn. (To determine them accurately, numerous tearing tests would have been requU°ed, because of the difficulty of applying exactly planned stresses.)
Warp and woof display approximately the same ultimate strength,
corresponding to the approximately equ al number of threads per
meter (d. fabrics C, D ). In fabrics A, B the warp seems to have
been made of stronger threads. In the diagonal stresses the point
of rupture lies higher up than for warp or woof, since the two thread
systems share the burden. It is just here that exact determinations
are difficult, for at the place where the tension is applied the lateral
contraction is strongly opposed, and hence the load on the individual
thread is increased (d. fig. 27); rupture therefore appears in general
too soon.
The observed ultimate strengths differ from those occurring in
practical work in being too large; the stress under which the envelope
bursts is lower than would be expected from these experiments. This
phenomenon was brought out clearly in tests of long duration made
with three-layer fabrics with diagonal layer between of less interest
in this place; it is due to viscosity. The constructor must keep this
in mind in applying empirical values of the ultimate strength, as
determined by tearing or bursting tests of short duration.
TEST III-THREAD EXTENSION .

.A. cotton thread taken from a spool was looped 10 times over 2
eyelets (fig. 28), thus making a bundle of 20 threads bound together
at two pomts (Knoten, fig. 28), between which two marks were made
upon tlie bundle, and the distance between the marks (Messlange)
measured; this distance was originally 500 IIlID. .A. balance pan of
weight 55 g. was suspended from the lower eyelet, and weights of
200 g. added successively; one minute after each addition to the load
the distance between the marks was again measured. When rupture
took ra1ce, it began with the breaking of a single thread, after which
the others broke after intervals of a few seconds-an indication that
the load was distributed with sufficient uniformity among the 20
individual threads.
The observed values of the extension obt ained in two such tests,
r epresenting, therefore, the mean values for 40 threads, are graphed
in figure 29. The curve is of the same general character as those of
the previous test, but approximates more closely to that of Hooke's

law. The extension causing rupture lies between 5 and 6 per cent,
of the same magnitude, therefore, as that in figure 24 (cf. p. 172) .
By subtractin~ the effect due to thread extenslOn from the values
obtained for the elongation in figures 23-26 we get the part due
purely to thread straightening. It may reach 10 per cent (woof of
fabric D), but may also be very small (warp of C) .

to the axis of the cylinder (fig. 6, p. 158) was successively equal to
0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, 90°. The bases were made of grooved
disks of wood 30 mm. thick. The tension was produced by water
pressure, the water inside the cylinder being in communication by
means of a rubber tube with a water reservoir which could be raised
at will, so that any desired pressure could be produced.
The ratio of tensions was regulated by means of weights acting
either positively (so as to increase the longitudinal tension) or negatively (so as to decrease it). The cylinder was attached to an iron
bar CD-Eisen) by screwin~ at one end; in the :first case, i t was suspended from the bottom of the bar and weights hung on (figs. 30-31);
ill the second case it stood upright on the top of the bar and the
weight was applied by means of a double lever balanced over its top
(fig. 32) . In. the latter case, the longitudinal tension could not be
qUlte brought to zero, since then the cylinder would have opposed
no resistance to bending. The minimum ratio of longitudinal to

176

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

transverse tension actually employed was one-fifth; even in this case
it was necessary to prevent the cylinder from bending over by slight
lateral supports.
The following tension ratios were investigated:
O2 /0 1 =0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, infinity.
For the tension ratio 0.5 the cylinder stood upright without any
applied weight, on the known principle that in a cylinder with internal
hydrostatic pressure the longitudinal tension is half the lateral. The
weight of the upper wooden disk, being very slight in comparison to
the water pressures (7,500 ffiffi . of water) was neglected. For the
r atios 1, 2, and infinity, the cylinder was suspended with directly
attached additional weights. For the tension ratio infinity (fig. 31)
the longitudinal tension O2 was produced solely by this weight, while
the lateral tension was made zero by emptying the cylinder of water.

portion s (those in which all the lateral tension, is greate r than or
at
least equal to O2 , the longitu dinal tension).
In the surfaces, the charac ter of thread shear as predic ted in figures
10-12 comes clearly to light. The observ ed values differ, howev
er,
in absolute magni tude from the theoret ical ones; the higher values
are less than what was predic ted because of elasticity, viscosity,
the space require ment of the thread s, while the lower values and
are
altered by the simulta neous thread straigh tening and thread extension.
The theoret ical surfaces are symme trical about the plane -y=45°
the observed ones are not. This is due to inequa lities betwee n warp,
and woof. The extens ion of the woof is always greater than that
the warp in the same position, and its contra ction less than that of
the warp; thus, in figure 33, the increas e in diamet er is greate r of
-y=90° than for -y=0°, because in the former case the thread for
s of
the woof lie in the plane of the cross section. Except ional extensi
bility of the woof corresponds always to except ional contra ctibilit y
of the warp, and vice versa.
In figures 35 and 38 we find in every case a positiv e twist at -y =
This is the phenom enon described on page 12, a twist at 45° 45°.
solely to thread straigh tening . The sense of twist is the same due
for
all cases, since both longitu dinal and transve rse tensions stretch the
woof more tnan they do the warp.
Figure s 35 and 38, however, show a slight twist not only at 45°,
but also at 0° and 90°, in one case positive, in the other negativ
e.
The cause is as follows: In the fabric employed, in the state of zero
load, when the fabric was remove d from the roll and cut out
Rolle entnommen und rw,ch der Kettenrichtung orientiert ausgesc(von der
hnitten)
the an~le betwee n warp and woof was not exactly 90°, but about
1° or 2 less than 90°. In the cylinde r for which -y=0 the thread
s
of the woof were inclined by this much to the axis; when the load
was applied, they set themselves parallel to the axis, and thus twisted
the cylinder throug h this angle of 1° or 2°. In the cylinde r
for
which -y=900 , the warp was paralle l to the axis, so that no twist
could arise when ~ = 00. With increasing lateral tension, howev
er,
0"1
twist made its appear ance; for the thread s of the woof, not lying
exactly in the plane norma l to the axis, did not form closed
but rather arcs of spirals, which drew apart from one anothecircles,
r until
opposed by the momen t due to the increas ing obliqu ity of the warp
thread s. The figures show clearly the increase of twist with
increasing lateral tension .
The values for the tensions laid out along the axes of the diagra ms
- correspond to the initial value of the diamet er of the miniat ure
cylinder. The actual tensions (load divided by actual diamet er) show
in
places, however, quite considerable depart ures from these values because of the large chano-es in diamet er. 'fhe graphs are thus
torted. Were this not the case, then, e. g., the negativ e surface disfor
the diminu tion in length would be congru ent with the positiv e surface for the increase in diamet er, and vice versa. It would be possible to compu te the actual tensions from the measu rement s of the
diamet er, and thus to improv e the curves. This correction must
be
made by means of a long process of interpo lation, and is superfluous, since the surfaces are em~loyed not for purposes of compu
tation but simply to give genera l Ideas.

FABRICS WITH MORE THAN ONE LAYER.
DEDUCTION OF THE

DEFOR.J.~ATION

CURVES FROM THOSE OF SINGLE
LAYERS.

The deformations of the fabrics with more than one layer, which
are exclusively used in the construction of envelopes, are deduced
from those of the single layer.
Consider the following fabrics made from material D: A paralleldoubled (see p. 158) fabric; a diagonal-doubled fabric, corresponding
thread systems of the two layers making an angle of 45°; a threelayer fabric, two layers being parallel to each other and the third
diagonal. The total tension corresponding to any given deformation is found by adding the tensions corresponding to this deformation for the individual layers. Thus, with diagonal-doubled fabric
the value of the tension, m, in figure 26, is the sum of the values a
and b, giving the tensions producing the same deformation in the
individual layers; with a three-layer fabric it would be n=2a+h.
For the three-layer fabric there are four principal directions.
The terms" warp" and" woof" relate to these directions in the continuous (durchgehende) 1 layers; the terms "diagonal warp" and
"dia.$onal woof" relate to these directions in the diagonal layer,
whicn in the manufacture of the fabric is laid down in single oblique
strips upon the continuous strips of the other layer (in einzeZmen
schragen Streifen auf die durchgehende Bahnen aufqeZegt). When,
as in fi{0ITe 39, we have diagonal-doubled fabric, with both layers
made 01 the same material, the four principal directions reduce to
two.
The curves show that the manner of doubling is of decisive influence upon the strength and upon the magnitude of the deformations.
P ar allel-doubled fabric has twice the strength of the single layer.
Diagonal-doubled fabric is stronger than the single layer .only by an
insignificant amount, for the diagonal layer, because of its high
extensibility, takes only a small part of the load. Only when the
paraUel layer (parallel to the stress) has reached the point of rupture
does the tension go over to the other layer, with a sudden increase
in the extension. Diagonal-doubled fabric therefore offers no
worth-while advantage over the single layer as regards strength.
Th e ratio of extension under diagonal stress to extension under
stress parallel to warp or woof is as great for parallel-doubled as for
single fabric. On the contrary, diagonal-doubled fabric displays
no gr'eater deformation with diagonal or "shearing" forces than
under forces parallel to either thread system; it is "rigid against
shear." Thus thread shear, which is res:ponsible for the largest
part of all deformations, has no effect on It. Only thread stretch
and thread extension need be considered. This property is almost
as important as is high ultimate strength.
Three-layer fabric combines the high Ultimate strength of parallel
doubled with the "rigidity against shear" of diagonal-doubled fabric.
The representation of the behavior of diagonal-doubled fabric is
completed by the graph of its lateral contraction, at the bottom of
I P robably means as also on page 14 that tbe strips ol this layer run through Crom one end ol the envel·
opes to the other.-Trans!.

figure 39. Note here, that by reason of the multiplicity of contributing causes, different lateral contractions correspond to one and the
same extension for different directions of applied stress, even in the
case of the single layer; these must be found by experiment. Thus,
for material D, the magnitude of the lateral contraction r elatively
to the elongation is found from figure 26, for loads applied parallel
to the warp, to the woof, and along the diagonal, respectively.
In the case of fabrics of more than one layer, without diagonal
stress, the contraction is sometimes equal to the highest contraction
that would be undergone by any of the layers separately. If this
were not the case-e. g., if the actual contraction were a mean of the
two or three individual values-the layer which would by itself contract the most would undergo a tension in the diagonal direction,
the others would undergo a pressure. This is impossible. Now,
since the curves of relative l ateral contraction intersect each other
(fig. 39, bottom), we:find corners in the contraction curves of multiple
fabrics, which, however, are in general so flattened out that in
practice they are not perceived as such.
TEST V.-ELONGATION CURVES FOR MULTIPLE FABRICS.

(Fabrics E, F, G of the table.)

A repetition of Test II with parallel-doubled, diagonal-doubled,
and three-layer fabrics gave the diagrams of figure 40. The three
fabrics subjected to test were thus different from the previously
described fabric D, as well as from one another. Nevertheless, the
character of the theoretical curves predicted in figure 39 from the
curves for single layers is clearly to be discerned.
The sudden increase in elongation in the case of three-layer fabric
was especially clear. In less than a minute the diagonal central
layer, although tightly cemented between the two principal layers,
was torn throughout its whole length into a number of small pieces,
so that the fabric by transmitted light appeared uniformly speckled
(gesprenkelt).
IIi. the case of the diagonal-doubled fabric this observation was
made only once, for the point of rupture of the surviving layer lies
closer to the point at which the tenSIOn changes over (to that layer),
and is reached too soon because of the destruction of the first layer.
The observed points are plotted for one curve in the case of diagonaldoubled and one curve in the case of threefold fabric.
THE SHEARING STRESSES.

In the preceding treatment, all deformations were deduced from
the two mutually perpendicular normal tensions <T1 (transverse) and
c? (longitudinal) ; the concept of shearing stresses was not introduced. There is a certain justification for this procedure in the case
of simple (single layer) fabrics, for these do not oppose resistance to
shearing stresses, but set themselves so as to annul them; this tendency is what we designated as "thread shear." In considering the
bending of envelopes, it is desirable to introduce the conception of
shearing stress, in order to make the procedure conform with the customary bending computations in the construction of machinery.

Three miniature cylinders of the fabric like those of T est IV, of

weight, this producing, as stated, a tension ratio 1: 2 (longitudinal

of a single layer of material D, the thread (presumably the woof.Translator) being in one case parallel to the axis, and in the other
inclined to the axis at 45° . The third cylinder was diagonal-doubled,
i. e., made of two such layers glued together, one layer parallel to
the axis and one at 45° .
A disk of 160 mm . diameter was attached to the lower base of the
cylinder, the upper base being secured against torque. (Fig. 41.)
Two cords were attached at the edge of the disk, and thence carried

the opposite side from the rhombus, is neglcted, as in Test IV.
In figure ,42 the tangent of the angle of shear, <p, is graphed as a
function of the shearing stress. The curves display a marked
hysteresis, as was expressed and explained in figure 20. Concepts
such as remanence (residual magnetism), coercive force, initial curve
(that obtained when stress is applied for the first time), may be carried over directly from the science of magnetism.
The difference between the single layer with woof parallel to the
axis and the single layer set diagonally is very striking. The first
resJ>onds to shearing stress principally by thread shear, the second
only by thread straIghtening and thread extension. Hence a high
degree of shear corresponds to a low de~ree of elongation (as seen ill
fig. 26, p. 173) and vice versa. We Should, then, expect that the
diagonal-doubled fabric would behave, in respect to torque, about as
the single layer set diagonally, since the parallel-lying layer takes up
only a small part of the stress. The observed shear IS, in fact, much
more nearly like that of the diagonal single layer than like that of
the parallel single layer. However, the twist is greater than with
the single diagonal layer, whereas we should e:A-'pect it to be somewhat smaller.
This departure from the theory is due to the increased diameter of
the cylinder (evidently the increase due to the internal pressure. Transl.) . In figure 42 the diameter d and the height h of the rhombus are graphed as functions of T, the unit of length beino- the millimeter. The diameter of the cylinder, made of the sino-fe diagonal
layer, is greater than that of the diagonal-doubled cylinder, as in the
latter case the expansion is restrained by the parallel layer. This
difference in diameter operates in the following manner. The twist
results from the len&thening of one set of diagonal threads and the
shortening of the other, thus increasing the tension on one set and
diminishing it on the other. The smaller the diameter the smaller
is the initial tension due to the internal pressure, and the larger is
the relative change in tension due to the shearing stress. Thus, when
the threads are initially under slight tension the lenghtening and
shortening under given shearing stress are greater than when they
are highly tensed already (as is the case in the larger cylinder), and
permit only slight changes in form.
It is difficult to arrange exactly the same experimental conditions
for tests on the two kinds of fabric. It would be necessary to prevent increases in the diameter without interfering with the torsion

(e. g., by m eans of numerous unconnected rinO's). We were able to
omit this precaution, as we were concerned only to show the advantage, as regards behavior toward torque, of the diagonal as contrasted with the parallel position of the fabric on the envelope.

FIG. 42.-Test VI, shear (under torque) of single-layer and diagonal-doubled fabrics. (Materia l D of the
table.)

The three torsion experiments were sometimes calTied through to
the maximum admissible value of shearing stress. This maximum
depends on the two normal tensions of the cylinder, 0'1 and 0'2' being
given by the formula
Ii/ax.

7

=

..j0'10'2

The deduction of this formula from general hypothesis will be
carried out later in connection with the computation of the stresses
in the envelope. For the case of an ideal network, it is obtained as
follows :
In figure 43 let a = f3 be. the angle made by the threads with the
axis. Obviously, so long as no torque is applied, the longitudinal
tension 0'2 will be divided equally between the two thread systems,
and the threads will set themselves parallel to the resultants of
0'1 and 0'2'
This state of tensions is d epicted by the cross-hatched
parallelograms of forces. If in addition a shearing stress appears,
one of the systems of threads undergoes an increase in tension, the

other system a decrease. The angle of intersection is not changed.
There is then a certain value of the shearing stress, for which the
tension on the latter system vanished. If, when the torque was still
further increased, the cylinder retained
I
its form, the threads of this sy tem
would be under pressure (parallel to
their lengths), which is impossible.
Folds are therefore formed; the cylinder becomes con tricted, assuming a
shape like. a hyperboloi~ (der ?ylin.der
8chnurt 81,ch hyperboloid-jehm'l{} em):
the equilibrium of forces becomes
labile; the continuation of the twisting leads to a complete collapse of the
cylinder, the water being squeezed out.

Now, according to equation ( I ),
tan a' tan {3 = ui/UZ
in this case, where 0. = {3,
tan a = -./U1
/U2
hence
T rnax =

-./u1UZ

The critical shearing stress is therefore to be computed, for the
present test, as follows. Since the folds must appear where the
normal tensions are least, i. e., at the top where the fabric is fi."5[ed
to the base, the diameter is to be taken as not much more than
80 mm. The water pressure at the top, which controls the lateral
tension U II is equal to IV-tH, H depending on the diminution in
length and being, on the average, about 110 mm. Hence
U1

0:: (7,500 -110) ' 0.04 = 296 kg/m.

The longitudinal tension is given by the pressure W + !H + the
weight of the disk, or rather the pressure equivalent of the weight of
the disk-on the average, 7,500+110+75 mm.,
U2

00:: 7,685' 0.04'

! = 154 kg/m

hence, the critical shearing stress at the top is
T

max = -'/296'154 =214 kg/m

The shearing stress simultaneously existing at the level of the rhombus is found from T max by considering the change in value of the
square of the diameter. For example, for single-layer fabric in the
parallel position,
T 0:: 214'(80/83.5)2 = 196 kg/m
These are the theoretical values of the stress at which folds should
appear; they are indicated on figure 42 by the letters F th , while the
letters Fv indicate the values at which they are first 0 bserved. These

latter are naturally not perfectly sharp, and a certain latitude I S
thus left for personal judgment. Never theless , the flgreement is
satisfactory.
DEFORMATION OF AN ENVELOPE OF PARALLEL- DOUBLED FABRIC.

It is now possible to complete the picture, which in test IV we made
of the envelope as regards increase in diameter, decrease in length,
and twist, by taking into account the bending. We anticipate what
is to follow by stating that each cross section of the envelope is under
the influence of bending and shearing stresses.
Figure 44 represents schematically a balloon with vertically
suspended gondola, with the deformations due to applied couples
and to shear.
If the fabric lies parallel to the axis the envelope first undergoes
(according to figs. 36-38, p . 178) a small increase in diameter, a small
decrease in length, and no twist. The couples now produce bending
stresses, which bend the envelope upward at the ends. Since, however, the bending can take place only by virtue of thread straightening and thread extension, it remains confined to small values. On
the other hand, the shearing forces produce a large alteration in angle
of the par allel fabric. (Of. fiO". 42, left, p. 185.)
If tlie fabric is set diagon;JJ'y at 45° (to the axis), the envelope first
undergoes (according to figs . 36-38) a very large increase in diameter
and decrease in length, and little or no twist (see p. 157): The
diagonal fabric responds to the bending moment by thread shear,
the angles in its network becoming sharper upward and more obtuse
downward. The result is that the ends are bent upward considerably. The change in the line of centroids (elastische Linie) due to
shearing forces is, on the contrary, slight, for such a change can result
only from thread straightening and thread extension.
In both cases, therefore, the upward bending of the envelope
exceeds what is permissible, the difference being merely, that with
parallel fabric the bending is due primarily to shearing stress, with
diagonal fabric primarily to the bending moment.
It therefore follows, that neither slll&!e-Iayer nor parallel-doubled
fabric, whether set parallel or diagonally with respect to the axis,
is advantageous for the construction of the envelopes of nomigid
balloons. It is, of course, conceivable, that any curvature of the axis
might be annulled by previously giving it a corresponding negative
curvature; just as it is possible to attajn a perfectly definite length
and diameter, by allowing for expansion and shor tening beforeh and. However, even thiS would not meet satisfactorily all the
conditions of actual flight, in which a number of considerable bending and shearing forces are encountered (rudder, squalls). The envelope would rea.ct to these momentary influences with large flexions, and
the ease of steering would be diminished. In the case of airships
with diagonal fabric, there is the additional disadvantage that the
unavoidable variations of gas pressure during fli~h t (due to ascending, descending, radiatio:p.) cause them to " breathe," i. e., to change
in length and diameter, to an extent which can not be allowed.
How carefully the constructor must take into account these properties of parallel-doubled fabric is demonstrated by the French
airship manufactory, in which parallel-doubled material is used by

made by folding together a quarter sphere (zusammengeklapter Viertelkugel) with the result that at this point, where because of the short
lever arm the effect of the bendinG' moment is inferior to that of the
shearing forces, the direction of the fabric changes gradually from
parallel to diagonal. The upward bending is thus reduced to a
minimum. Correspondingly, a gradual deflection of the direction of
the fabric is carried out at the rear end of the ship, with the same
success.
DEFORMATION OF AN ENVELOPE MADE OF DIAGONAL- DOUBLED FABRIC.

For nonrigid ships, of which the envelopes have to resist large
moments and shearing foroes, only diagonal-doubled fabric can be
employed (any fabrio is ·to be called diagonal doubled, if it contains
at least one diagonallaler). For its parallel layer prevents large
alterations in the line 0 centroids, while its diagonal layer opposes
shear. Its lateral expansion and longitudinal contraction are small,
especially when a sample is chosen in which the extensibility of the
woof exceeds that of the warp as little as possible.
In the case of the first envelope of the Siemens-Schuckert balloon,
the most extreme type of nonrigId airship, it became apparent that
even the small bending of diagonal fabric may, under certain circum-

stances, exceed the permissible maximum. When the motors were
developing full power and the rudder was sharply turned (bei starkem
Ruderlegen) the envelope bent in a downward direction through an
estimated angle of about 8°, this being observed because by chance the
airship was passing over a reflecting water surface. Beyond this
point, folds appeared. This bending resulted in a deviation of the
ship from her intended line of flight, which made it impossible to use
the full power of the motors continually during squally weather.

good photograph is at hand.
B. EXPERIMENTAL BASES FOR PREDETERMINATIONS OF THE DEFOR.
MATION OF ENVELOPES.

Along with the fundamental differences, as to extensional properties, between the three types of fabric (parallel-doubled, diazonaldoubled, 3-layer), we find differences in quality between ditterent
samples of the same fabric, dependin~ on thread strength, number of
threads per unit length, previous tenSIOn during the process of manufacture, etc. Hence, in order to predetermine the deformation of a
envelope made from a given material, it is necessary to determine

190

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS .

the II characteristic" of the selected material by special experiments.
We must inquire :
(1) What data are necessary and sufficient to determine completely
the character of the fabric with resp ect t9 its extensional properties ~
(2) By what experiments can these data be ascertained? .
We cut a square element of the fabric out of the envelope [one side]
parallel to the axis, and apply to it the tensions which appear in the
most general case. These are, the normal tensions O"u 0"2' and the
shearing stress 7. The" strain" or behavior of the fabric is fully
determined, when we know the variation in length of the sides of the
square and the variations of its angles. We designate the graph
which represents the relation between variation in length and normal
tension by the term normal characteristic and: the graph which
represents the relation between variation in angle and shearing stress
by the t erm shear characteristic.
THE NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC.

To the homogeneous materials used in the construction of machinery, we can apply the law of superposition ; that is, we can determine
the longitudinal expansion and lateral contraction due to each of the
two normal tensions separately, and set the total expansion equal to
the algebraic sum of the individual expansions so determined. That
is, the normal characteristic is established by the knowledge of a
sin ale expansion CUTve and of the constant r atio between expansion
and Dateral] contraction. Since throughout the practical range the
expansion curve is a straight line (Hooke's law) , it is sufficient to
give a single number, the slope of this CUTve (coefficient of expansion) .
It was already shown in Test II (p. 170) that this rule does n ot
hold for balloon fabrics. Furthermore, the r atio b etween the expansion in one direction and the simultaneous contraction in the perpendicular direction is not constant (bottom of fig. 39, p. 180) . Hence
the establishment of the normal char acteristic requires two diagrams,
one for each principal direction.
Furthermore, as we shall see later, the superposition law is not
valid ; i. e., the deformation produced by lateral tension depends on
the simultaneous longitudinal tension and vice versa. Each of the
two diagrams must, therefore, consist not of a single CUTve, bu t of a
family of curves or a surface, each of the curves on which re]?resents
the expansion for varying lateral tension under the condItion of
constant lonaitudinal tension or vice versa. The normal characteristic of baIIoon fabrics, therefore, consists of two families of curves.
THE SHEAR CHARACTER[STIC.

We find a similar state of affairs in the case of the shear characteristic. For the materials used in machinery a single mnnber, the
coefficient of shear, is sufficient. Test VI (p. 182) showed that in the
case of balloon fabric this number must be replaced by a curve, since
Hooke's law is only an approximation in the case of shear. It
furthermore showed that the shear depends on the normal tensions.
If it depended only on one of the two normal tensions, we should have,
as in the case of the normal characteristic, a family of CUTves instead
of a single curve. Since it depends on both, we require a family of

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

191

surfaces. Such a family may, e. g., be made up of surfaces of constant
shear, over which the longitudinal and transverse tensions vary.
B ecause of the differences between warp and woof it is desirable
to determine the shear characteristic for both directions. In the
torsion experiment this corresponds to the positive and negative
branches of the hysteresis loop.
Since the shear depends on the two normal tensions, we next inq uire
whether, inversely, expansion and contraction may not depend on the
simultaneous shearing stresses. Were this the case we should have
to r eplace the two curves determining the normal characteristic each
by a family of curves. However, as we shall see, the influence of
the shearing stresses upon expansion and contraction is, within the
practical limits, negligible, so that the simplification in question is
justifiable, especially so as it is introduced for the purpose of rendering complicated computations avoidable. For the same reason
we shall later find ourselves impelled to reduce the shear characteristic to a single surface by a p articular simplification.
METHODS FOR ASCERTAINING THE NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC.

The experimental scheme for determining the normal characteristic is dictated by the end to be attained; the fabric is to be loaded
by simultaneously applying tensions parallel to the two ~rincipal
directions, and the variations in length parallel to the two directions
are to be measured. This double loading may be brought about
either by the combination of internal hydrostatic pressure and suspended weight acting upon a miniature cylinder (Test IV, p. 175) or
simply by the application of weights to a flat cruciform piece of the
fabric . The latter scheme possesses the advantages of simplicity and
of absence of corrections (p .177, bottom); it is merely the experiment
upon the normal strip, performed in two dimensions (Tests II and V).
Each observation gives one point for each of the two families of
curves belonging to the normal characteristic. Taking this into
account, three methods may be distinguished:
1. The entire series of points used to determine both families may
'be determined successively from a single cross-shaped piece.
2. Each of the individual curves making up a family may be de.:
termined from a separate cross.
3. E ·ach separate point may be determined from a separ ate crossThe choice of methods is decided by the condition, that the influence of slowness of deformation (Test I, p. 177) should be circumvented as far as possible. In this respect the third method is by far
the best. It precludes mutual influences between the observed
points (gegensettige Beeinflussung der Versuchspun7cte; i. e., probably
the determination of any point is independent of that of any otherTransl.] and permits the experimenter to make tests of long duration
without expending too much time [probably because tests can simultaneously be carried out on several samples-Transl.], in which tests
it is possible at any time to a certain whether the test has already
lasted long enough or whether it should be prolonged. The method
requires a relatively largo amount of fabric, but this is not a serious
disadvantage, considering the size of balloon envelopes. In fact, it
may rank as an advantage, for it becomes possible to form an opinion
of the uniformity of the fabric, since the numerous observed values

192

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

determine the surface graphed with great accuracy and exceptional
values are easy to detect.
When the first method is used, the observations must come one
after the other in time, forming a single series; with the second
method, they are grouped in several series. Con equently, the time
allowed for each observation can not be nearly so long as is permi sible with the first method, or the test would require months . Furthermore, the state of the sample at the time of an observation depends on its state at the prevIOus observations-there is a sort of
" interferen ce" among the various obsreved values. It is n ece sary
to reduce this interference to a minimum by arranging the order of
observations in a particular way. H ere begins the uncertainty, the
opportunity for personally made interpolations. The manner of
making these interpolations is given in the description of T est VII.
METHOD FOR ASCERTAIKI TG THE SHEAR CHARACTERISTIC.

The shear characteristic is best det ermined from torsion experiments
like those of T es t VI. If the shear is to be measured for m different
values of the lateral and n different values of the longitudinal t ension,
it is necessary to plot mn hysteresis loops . The desired permanent
values of the shear are to be deduced from the instantaneous values
actually observed by t aking account of the remanence.
Here, too, it is possible to determine all the curves-in this case,
hysteresis loops-by observations on a single miniature cylinder or
on several. It is not, however, so essential to have many samples, as
the permanent values of the shear are deduced from the mean hyst eresis loop, rather than by protracting the time during which the
load is applied.

The experimental arrangement is shown in figures 48- 50.
A cross-shaped piece of fabric, the four equal arms of which are

equally long, so that the central portion of the cross is a square, is
outstretched in a framework made of sheet metal with corner plates
(aus Blech und Wink eln) . The two tensions are produced by the
weight of sandbags applied to the arms A and B by means of bent
levers, of which the arms stand in the ratio 1 : 2. (Fig. 48, lower
left.) The points C and D, opposite the levers, are fixed . However,
set screws are placed both at the levers and at the fi.,'Ced points, the
purpose of which is to keep the central point M of the cross over the
center of the frame and the levers U in a horizontal position, whatever
the amount of the deformation.

(figs. 49 and 50) these lines have been r etraced h eavily in white,

To each observation of the first series corresponds an observation
of the second series, made for the same values of 0 1 and O2 , The last
step in the determination of the normal characteristic consists in
comparing and weighting the corresponding observations. The
weighting and the subsequent interpolation from which the continuous curves are drawn is governed by the following considerations.
In some cases the results of one series are more reliable than those of
the other. In particular, the four "initial curves," two from each
series, in which one of the tensions remains zero while the other
varies, are specially reliable (they are distinguished by points in figs.

are therefore taken over bodily into figure 54, where they form
limiting curves of the families there graphed (which are those corresponding to la, IIb), while the points of the initial curves of IIa, 1b
appear along the axis of ordinates in figure 54. As to the terminal
pomts, at which both tensions have thelr maximum value (4 0) it is
certain that in one series the values are too high, in the other too low.

as possible t.o the original curves of figure 53. The zero points are
those of the first series.
The dotted curves in figure 54 are those of the ot.her family [e. g.,
on the left, (J"z varies continuously in the continuous curve and (J"t
is the parameter, while (J"l varies continuously in the dotted curves
and (J"z is the parameter]. This scheme perrmts a certain contr6le of
the shape of the curves. Point A of one system corresponds to
B of the other, C to D, etc.
The normal characteristic reveals everything of importance about
the behavior of the fabric:
Hooke's Law does not hold, for the curves are not straight lines.
The law of superposition does not hold, for the curves are not
congruent.
If the deformation were due entirely to thread shear, it would
vanish whenever the two tensions were equal. Since thread straightening and thread extension also enter in, the deformation does not
vanish in this case; the curve which is the locus of points of equal
tension (drawn with alternate dots and dashes in fig. 54) lies in the
positive part of the plane.
The modulus of elasticity at any point would be the tangent to
the curve at the point in question. For example, the modulus of
elasticity, for strams parallel to the warp, and for the values of the
normal tensions at point P, would be the tangent to the curve at
P: 284 X 10 or 2840 kg/m.

[Fabric G.]

In this test the number of observations was limited to 5 X 5 = 25,
at. int.ervals of 100 kg/m in the tensions. The maximum t.ension
was 400 kg/m.
The five observations for a single value of the longitudinal tension
are made simultaneously by the scheme of figures 55 and 56. The
various lateral tensions are produced directly by susJ?ended weights,
the uniform longitudinal tension by a suspended weIght and nearly
frictionless pulley (die gemeinsame Langsspannung wird horizontal
unter Zwischenschaltung ie einer auf schrager Ba7m, 45°, frei aufgelegten, dh. nahezu reibungsfreien Rolle erzeugt. Obscure. The word
Rolle may refer to the interconnections between crosses shown in
fig. 56).
For the case in which the longitudinal tension was zero, four
normal strips were employed (not visible in fig. 55).
The arms of the crosses were 50 IDID. broad, the weights varied
from 5 to 20 kO". For the measurements, the entire square forming
the center of t11e cross (drawn in white in fig. 56) was employed.
The accuracy of measurement, in spite of the shortness of the sides
of this square, is sufficient for practical purposes because of the
inhomogeneity of the fabric. The dist.ort.ion of the square by
"leaking over" of t.he tensions, as described in Test VII, is impeded
by making several slit.s in each cross arm parallel to the direction
of the tension. This scheme serves the purpose much more simply
and surely than does the scheme of auxiliary clamps, previously employed. The slits intercept the [diagonal] tensions liable to extend

away from the central area. The cross arms must be sufficiently
long to reduce to a negligible amount the oblique forces due to gaping
open of the slits.
The test was performed in two corresponding series of observations. Two separate crosses were made for eacn observation. For
the first series, the lateral tensions were first applied, then the longitudinal tension. Simultaneously, the longitudinal tension was applied to the other set of crosses. Mter the first series of observations, upon the first set of crosses, was finished, the weights were
suspended from the lateral arms of the other set. Thus for each
pair of values of the tensions, two values of the deformation were
observed; one value being influenced more by the lateral, the other
more by [,he longitudinal tension. For the four DOl'mal strips, for
which the longitudinal tension is zero, the second series naturally
does not exist.
The two series of tests lasted three weeks. During this period the
deformations were measured a number of times. The measurements were always made at three places on the square, in the middle,
and at a distance of 5 mm. from corners.
In Fig. 57 the measured extensions are plotted (as percentages
of the imtiallength) in families of curves; the :first and third diao-rams
reproduce the extensions as measured 24 hours, the second and fOUl"th
the values found three weeks after the loads were applied. The
continuous curves belong to the first series, the dotted curves to the
second. (Considering the way in which a baTIoon-envelope is made
out of longitudinal strips, we designate as lateral tension 0'11 here
and everywhere else in this work, the tension parallel to the woof,
and as longitudinal tension CT2 , that parallel to the warp.)
The apparently chaotic way in which the different empIrical curves
interlace each other is due less to uncertainty of measurement than
to nonuniformity of the fabric; because, in all. measurements carried
out with one and the same cross, over the three-weeks interval, the
deviation from the values expected was generally (in der R egel)
found to be the same.!
The influence of prolongation of the period of load was of the same
nature as that expected from Test I (p. 169). Readings after 14
days showed a marked increase of the deformation over that produced in one day, but were practically identical with those made
after three weeks, so that the three-week period may be regarded,
considering the accuracy of observation, as long enough.
The difference between the two series of results shows the strong
influence exerted upon the extension by that one of the two tensions
which was first applied. Comparison of the :fir t with the second
and of the third with the fourth of the diagrams of figure 57 shows
that this influence diminishes in amount as the length of time,
during which the total load is applied, increases.
The normal characteristic is finally established, as in the previous
case, by combining and weighting equally the corresponding observations of the two series, the deformations for the three-weeks
period being the only ones retained; the mean between the corresponding values is thus plotted; the curves of which A is one, in

much narrower limits than those selected in the present research.
It is recommended to vary the longitudinal tension by smaller
amounts at a time, so as to make more measurements over a given
interval. A suitable practical value for the breadth of the cross-arm
is 100 mm., and the cross-arm m ay be divided by nine slits, at least
150 mm. long, into 10 strips each 10 mm. broad. It seems that two
series would be unnecessary, if the two t ensions are applied as nearly
at the same moment as possible. Since l?ractical obstacles prevent
simultaneous application of the weights, It might be done approximately by applyrng first a fraction of the lateral load, then a fraction
of the longituclinal load, then another fraction of the lateral load,
and so on until the entire load is applied.

TEST IX.-THE SHEAR C1I.ARAOTERISTIO OF A 3- UYER FABRIC .
[Fabric G.]

Employing the method of T est VI (p. 182), nine hysteresis loops
I-IX were plotted from ob ervation; truee of the e corresponded to
each of the three values 200, 250, 300 kg/m of the lateral tension,
and one of each three cOlTesponded to each of the values 80 per cent
20 per cent, 50 per cent of the ratio b etween longitudinal and laterai
tension. For the first two ratios, additional weights were employed,
in the way described on page 176. The values given for the tension
are computed on the inItial value of the diameter.
All nine tests were made upon one and the same miniature cylinder
of 80 (or, more exactly, 79 .6) rom. diameter and 300 mm. l ength,
which was always susr.ended; in order to produce the 20 per cent
ratio (0 2 :0 1 =0.2), the 'ne~ative" load was applied by means of an
equal-armed upside-down lever, as shown in figure 60.
Cylinders of three-layer fabric, closed at the ends as before (fig. 41,
p. 183) with grooved wooden disks (eingebundene H olzscheiben) were
found not to be sufficiently water-tight. The wooden disks were
therefore replaced by turned thin-walled bronze disks, to which the
fabric was clamped by means of two metal clamps 180 0 apart.
(Diese wurden daher ersetzt durch dunnwandig ausgedrehte B ronzescheib en, auf denen der Stoff durch je 2 um 180 0 ve7'setze Blechscheiben
festgeklemmt wurde.) The torsion disk of 160 rom. diameter, and
the weights of 2.5 kg. each, were the same as in Test VI, and a similar
rhombus with point downward was drawn upon the fabric.
The m aximum load applied was 10 kg., except when the tensions
were low, in which cases the load was not increased beyond 7.5 or
even 5 kg. so as to avoid the formation of folds. As the tests sometimes terminated with the highest applied load, and hence with t h e
cylinder considerably twisted, it was brought back by hand into its
zero position before beginning the next set of t ests. The intervals
between successive sets of tests were at least three hours long, and
during each of them the tensions were kept steady at the values
appropriate to the following set.
The results are graphed in the nine hysteresis loops (I-IX, fig. 61 ),
the trigonometric tangent of the angle of twist, i. e., the shear per
unit length, being represented as a function of the shearing stre s.
The v!1lues of the normal tensions corresponding to each of the curves
are as follows:

The first step in the setting up of the hysteresis curves shear
characteristic consists in replacing the hysteresis loops by single
curves. We mil$ht, for example, consider the initial curve as the
important one; by using this curve we could compute the shear
which would be undergone by the envelope when it is mounted for
the first time, b efore its first voyage. After it goes into service,
however, it is subjected to excess tensions, first in one sense and
then in the other, so that the eventual deformation corresponds to a
sort of average curve.

stresses occurrin& in practice are decidedly less than the critical stress
(that which prOduces folds) only the central part of the curve is of
importance. If now we go over into three dimensions and for each

of surfaces so produced forms the shear characteristic in the form
described on page 190.
Now in figure 61 we see that for slight shearing stresses the average
curves are verJ approximatelL straight lines, so that within certam
limits H ooke's law applies. We may then reduce the shear characteristic to a single surface by plotting the slope of this line, or modulus
of shear, as a function of the tensions. The slope taken is that at
the point of inflexion in the curve. The graph is in figure 62. For
example: From loop o. 1 we:find the value of the modulus of shear
to be 10 X 127.5 = 1275 kg/m for 01 = 300 and 02 = 240, and this value
is accordingly plotted in figure 62 vertically over the point having
these coordinates in the 0102 - plane.

ately from the difference in the nature of the phenomenon, and must
not be neglected in applying the shear characteristic to the computation of the shear of the envelope in practice.
The average curves obtained in the way described from the hysteresis loops can be replaced by straight lines, even when the shearing
stresses involved exceed the limits there proposed; we must, however,
employ the secant to the curve instead of the tangent at the point
of inflexion; the result is that the ordinates G (fig. 62) become
smaller.
Figure 62 shows that the shear is in general smaller, the greater
the tensions. This was observed in Test VI (p. 182) with singlelayer fabric and there explained in part. The reasonong may here be

the axis, which is the limiting value of the shear for a nonviscous
network, will for a given value of T diminish as 0 2 increases. The
practical shear will depend on the tension in the same way, since by
reason of the elastic forces and the viscosity it is always less than the
theoretical shear. In fi&"ure 63 the shear characteristic is represented
as a family of curves, this being a more suitable form for practical
application.
The change in diameter produced by the twist amounted to at
most 0.5 per cent for a load of roughly 100 kg/m, the change in length
to 1.5 per cent. Hence the influence of shearing stress upon elongation and lateral contraction is much smaller than that of the tensions
upon the shear. In considering the deformations arising in practice
it may be neglected, all the more because, as indicated on page 191,
the shearing stresses are largest only where the bending stresses are
smallest, and vanish where the bending stresses attain their maximum.

DEFORMATION OF THE ENVELOPE.

FOROES ACTING ON THE ENVELOPE.

The envelope of an airship undergoes both permanent and transitory
delOI'IDations. Only the former are to be considered in predetermining the shape of the envelope. We therefore ignore all aerodynamic
forces and all forces due to the motors (motorische Kra!te) which
appear during flight in a straight line or more particularly ill a curve,
and consider the airship in equilibrium in a horizontal position.
The envelope is subject, first, to the pressure on thewalls. This increases 1 practically uniformly from the bottom upward; the total
vertical component is equal to the total lilt A V, A representing the
lilting power cubic meter and V the volume. The weIght of the envelope and of all suspended loads form, together with the lift, a system
of forces in equilibrium.
The effect of the pressure and of the weights is to produce lateral
tension IT1 longitudillal tension IT2' and shearing stress T upon every
area element of the envelope. The axial component of the pressure
fixst produces longitudinal tension. The distribution of this tension
over the circumference depends on the shape of the cross section.
If this were a circle, and if the pressure were everywhere the same,
the longitudinal tension would be uniform. But the mst supposition is only approximately true, the second not at all; hence the
uniform longitudinal tension is complicated with bending stresses, so
that the point of application of the general resultant of the longitudinal tensions coincides with that of tbe general resultant of the forces
due to the pressure; hence the pressure alone tends to produce a
bending of the envelope.
The radial component of the pressmre produces lateral tension.
This, in conjunction with the suspended weight and the weight of the
envelope itself, is primarily responsible for the shape of the cross section; hence the manner in which the load is suspended is of especial
importance.
Since, in general, the load is otherwise distributed over the length
of the envelope than the lift, additional bending moments arise. Consequently, the longitudinal tension, which was nonuniform over the
circumference of the envelope by reason of the pressure alone, is still
further altered. Finally, the vertically acting loads are themselves
transmitted to the envelope by means of obliquely placed cords (suspension, Takelung), which produce forces parallel to the axis which
likewise affect the lonO"itucl..i.llal tension.
The equilibration 01 lift and weight throughout the length of the
envelope is performed by the shearing stresses.
THE PROOESS OF COMPUTATION .

Exact computation of the tensions and deformations at each point
of the envelope is impeded by the interdependence of the two tensions
and of the shearing stress which we have already studied. Furthermore, the cross section is circular only at the ends, deviating from
the circular shape in the region where the suspension is attached.

REPOR,T NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS .

Fortunately, if exact computation is impossible, it is likewise
superfluous. For, in the first place, the internal pressure is subject
to variations about a mean during flight. In the second place, the
forces depend on the temperature of the air and on the barometer.
In the third place, it results from the viscosity of the fabric that a
given load does not determine the deformation uniquely, but rather
determines a range of possible values, the one value which the deformation actually assumes depending on the previous loads. Finally,
the fundamental determinations of normal and shear characteristic
represent only more or less close approximations to the true mean
vulues, because of the inhomogeneity of the fabrics. If now we
recollect that the purpose of these investigations was to enable us to
avoid large errors m the shape of the envelope, it is clear that in the
computations to follow the aim must be to obtain practical approximations by using methods as similar as possible to those employed in
the construction of machinery.
For this reason we will neglect to a certain extent the interdependenoo of the individual stresses and separate the computation
mto several independent parts. If first we ignore bending and shearing stresses, there i'emain (as stresses of the first order of magnitude)
the longitudinal and lateral tensions due to an internal pressure
everywhere constant and of moderate amount. These arise when
the envelope is filled not with gas but with air, and its own Weight is
neglected. These first-order tensions produce increase in diameter
and decrease in length, which can be evaluated by means ' of the
normal characteristic. We then :fill the envelope with gas of the
same mean pressure; these tensions are at :first [zunachst,' may mean
to the first order of magnitude] unaltered. However, the moments
which now appear cause a bending of the envelope, which we compute
independently. I n the same way we shall devote a third section to
the Influence of shearing stress on the shape of the envelope. And,
while for these three separate investigations we assume circular
cross section, we take up in a fourth section the influence of a deviation of the cross section from circular form upon the bending of the
envelope.

If the envelope is made of transverse strips, the mean lateral tension

divided by the factor (100 +x)/100. The same holds for the longitudinal tension if the strips are parallel to the axis. This correction
may generally be omitted because of its slight influence upon the
final result.

BENDING OF THE GAs-FILLED ENVELOPE.
THE NAYIER HYPOTHESIS.

In computing the bending of the envelope, we employ the methods
used in technical mechanics for the bending of a straigh t rod, loaded in
its central plane, of symmetric cross section and variable moment of
inertia. The principle of these methods depends upon the N avier
hypothesis, viz, that plane cross sections remain plane after the
bending is effected.

F IG. 70.

In order to obtain an idea of the validity of the N avier hypothesis in
the case of bent balloon envelopes, a miniature model 20 cm. in diameter and about 150 cm.long was constructed from the three-layer fabric
G; aircles were drawn upon its surface, marking out the cross sections,
while it lay flat arid was filled only with air so that it was practically
undeformed; it was then suspended in the middle and filled with
water, acquiring thus a consIderable flexion. (Figs. 68-69.) The

212

pressure of the water was so adjusted that the lateral and longitudinal
tensions were equal to those in a nonrigid balloon of ordinary size;
the bending stresse , however, were decidedly greater, because the
suspension was applied only over a short portIOn of the model in the
center.
The model remained in the loaded state for three weeks, nearly
reaching a permanent value of the deformation.
The cross sections were examined by sighting along the margin of
a straightedge. Deviation from the plane would be expected near
the ends, if anywhere, but could not be detected at either end.
Shght deviations, appearing irregularly and of variable sign, are to
be ascribed to errors in reproducing the cross sections in the drawings,
which were made by hand.
From a single photograph it is not possible to determine rigorously whether any cross section is absolutely fiat, except in the case
of the cross section lying in the plane normal to the aXlS and passing
through the center of the camera lens; this cross section, if plane, is
projected as a line in the photograph, the others as ellipses. In order
to carry out the verification for all cross sections, it is desirable to
combine two photographs stereoscopically. This is shown in figures
70-71.
The model is suspended with its center over the center of a recta~~le XYVU and the camera placed at A i,l1 the prol0l?:~ation of
Y X and then at B, equally far out in the prolongation of V U. The
two photographs (figs. 68 and 69) are to be imagined as superpo ed
in figure 70 (top) . Their central points A and B (i. e., those immediately behind the center of the lens during the taking of the photographs) are easily found by examining the images of the rectangle
XYV U in the photographs. For, in the lower part of figure 70 (the
balloon and rectangle seen looking down from above), let us project
the images in the image planes bb upon the object plane (Obie7ctebene)
represented by the line UaXb in the lower diagram of figure 70 and
by the plane of the paper in the upper diagram. X a , X b , etc., are
then the projections ill the object plane of the images of X on the
two photographs.
ow the intersection of the lines XaY a and
Ua Va is at the central point of the photograph from position A, as
just defined (i. e., line parallel to the line drawn from the center of
the lens to the central point meet at infinity in the direction of the
central point).
If P is a point of the object, its images on the/hotographs win be
found at P a and P b • If now, on the superpose photographs (top,
fig. 70) we draw the lines A.Pa and BP b , they intersect at the point
where the image of P is to be located in the de ired parallel proj ection. Since 'these lines may, and in general will, intersect at a small
angle, it is desirable to shift the points P a, P b by the same amount a
along parallel lines, to locate the image of P once more in the same
manner, and then to verify the original location by drawing the line
from this image parallel to the direction P;P' a, which should pass
through it.
The two photographs, figures 68-69, were treated in this1J:ag' In

of the model appeared as 60 mm. Traces of both were made upon a
single sheet (fig. 71), the photograph from point A in continuous
and that from point B in dotted curves. The proce s, the result of
which is represented in figure 71 for two cross sections, gave the same
result as the observations with the straightedge. No deviation in
either direction from the plane was to be observed with the magnification employed.
It therefore appears permissible to assume the validity of the

THE BENDING MOME TS.

The first step in computing the bending is the plottIng of the moments
acting upon the envelope in the form of a curve of moments.
If, for every point along the length of the envelope, we subtract
the weight from the lift, we obtain the load CUTVe, and from this, in the
known way, by double integration, first the shear curve and then the
curve of moments. In addition to these moments of the vertical
forces we have two others (cf. p. 207), viz, the moment due to the
pressure and that due to the suspension (Takelung)

FlO. 72.-Moment of the gas pressure.

The first of these is due to the fact that the pressure at a perpendicular distance y from the central plane of tile envelope is equal

While the moments due to the vertically hanging loads in general
bend the ends of the envelope upward, the gas pressure and the suspension tend to produce the opposite effect; it is therefore the difference between the two sets of moments that determines the amount
of the bending.
THE BENDING TENSIONS.

The bending tensions produced by the bending moments, which
m ay be positive or negative, are superposed upon the longitudinal
tension of the air-filled envelope, which is always positive. They are
related to the moments by the equation (cf. fig. 74)

characteristic, is not in general fulfilled.

that we evaluate E, which is the slope
of the extension curve, at the proper

J is proportional to the moment of inertia of a curve, in this case that

the tension is measured per unit breadLh of the fabric and ha
nothing to do with the area of the cro s section. In this case it is
equal to 7rR3. Hence we have, for the bending tension in the extreme filament,

amax = ± Jib/ 7r R2

If the envelope is built up out of longitudinal strips, the moment f
inertia J is greater than 7rR3 by an amount due to the strengthening
effect of the seams and depending on the amount of overlapping of
adj acent strips (cf. p . 210). In practice this correction amounts to
3 to 6 per cent and somewhat more at the ends, according to the way
in which the strips are cut.

As previously indicated, E is constant over a given cross section, but
not over the entire envelope. For each cross section we must find
the value of E, which on the normal characteristic cOlTesponds to the
values Sl and S2 of the n ormal tensions prevailing on that cross section. In the case of the longitudinal tension regard must be paid to
the diminution of this produced by the suspenslOn, which may alter
considerably the corresponding value of E. This phenomenon should
strictly be considered in evaluating the dilation and the longitu dinal
contraction of the air-filled envelope; in practice, however, it is
permissible to ignore it until the evaluation of E is reached.
Since E is now determined and the other two factors J and Mb
are also determined, the curve of equation 8 can be plotted and the
form of the line of autroids established by two consecutive integrations.
THE SHEARING OF THE GAs - FILLED E:\,VELOPE.

In the construction of machinery, it is customary, in treating the
case of beams of which the length stands in a certain ratio to the
width, to neglect the deformation due to shearing forces . This is dot
permissible in the case of balloon envelopes; the deformation due to
the shearing stresses is a considerable part of the t otal deformation.

simultaneously arising bending tensions, the displacement 0 any

P, the r adius to which from the axis makes an angle a witli the

produces a shearing stress in the fabric itself. Since -ydl is a constant, the shearing stress must be proportional to sina:

as above.
These two methods lead to the same result only when the cross
section is circular. The agreement is, in a sense, a confirmation of
the observations made on the miniature balloon (p. 58) verifying the
N avier hypothesis. The assertion is, that the change in the shape
of the cross section ordinarily produced when a rod is bent does not
occur when the cross section is circular.

Flo. 76.--Shearing stresses ovor the circnmference of n cylinder.

The reasoning just developed in connection with figure 76 is also
valid if the cross section m-m is taken in a conical portion of the
hull. For, if each point P of the cross section (cf. fig. 77), is displaced vertically by an amount ,,-dl, the tangential component of this
shear will as before be equal to 'Y·dl·sina, so that the dependence of
shearing stress on a will be the same as for the cylinder. Since the
circumference has as before the value 27iR, the absolute value of 'f will
be equal to that at the corresponding point of the circumference of a
cylinder. The only difference between this case and that of the cylinder is, that to a distance dl measured along the a.m of the envelope
corresponds a breadth of fabric equal, not to dl, but to dl/coso. so that
a given shearing stress produces a displacement of the cross section
greater in the ratio 1: coso. This influence is, however, sufficiently
slight to be negligible, as when we were computing 0"1 and 0"2 (p . 210) .

THE SHAPE OF THE CROSS SECTION OF THE ENVELOPE.

The computations just given depended upon two hypotheses,

filled with air, viz, 1, that the radius of curvature, and, 2, that the lateral
tension, are uniform over the en tire circumference of each each cross

the computations, the second made it p ermissible to assume a smgle

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

value of the modulus of elasticity and a single value of the modulus
of shear for the entire cross section.
As a matter of fact, neither supposition is quite fulfilled. There
are some cross sections for which the first is true, and others in which
the second is fulfilled, but none in which both are valid. The reason
is, that the pressure varies as we go from below upwards, while the
suspension tends to produce constrIction ; the result is, that the cross
section becomes oval, the longer axis being as a rule vertical. The
influence of this phenomenon upon the line of centroids is indirect,
being due to the fact that an envelope of oval cross section opposes
to bending and shearing forces a resistance which is different from
and in general greater than, that presented by a cylindrical envelope~
THE FORCES ACTING ON THE CROSS SECTION.

In the Deutsche Z eitschrift fur Luftschijifahrt (1912, p . 322), the
shape of the cross section is investigated by Prof. M. Weber, of
Hanover, with especial reference to Ritter's Ingenieurmechanik
(Hanover,1876). His work relates to a special case, that in which the
lift and the weight are equal and opposite for each cross section individually, so that neither shearing stresses nor bending stresses arise.
This is the case only for a few particular cross sections of an actual
envelope.
The general case is depicted in figure 78: We consider a ring or
annulus of fabric, of unit breadth, situated at an arbitrary point of
the envelope. Upon it act the following "external" forces:
1. The internal pressure, p, measured in kilograms per square meter.
2. The weight of the fabric itself, per unit area, measured in kilograms per square meter.
3. The force exerted by the suspension, To, having components Tu
T z, Ts·
4. The longitudinal tension (12 .
5. The shearing stresses 71 and 7 2 •
We are concerned only with the forces which exert a direct influence
upon the lateral tension and upon the shape of the cross section.
Consequently we drop, first of all, the axial component Ts of the
force exerted by the suspension, and denote the resultant of Tl and
Tz by T. The weight suspended directly from the cross section,
Q, will be equal to 2T1 • Similarly, we neglect the longitudinal
t ension (12 ' for it has no effect whatever for cylindrical or conical
envelopes and only a very slight effect when the fabric has curvatures
differing from zero for two perpendicular directions (doppelt gewoZbt,·
i. e. neither radius of curvature infinite, as in the case of a cylinder) .
Furthermore, we drop the individual shearing stresses 71 and 7 2 ,
which are oppositely directed and in general different in magnitude,
and insert the difference between the two, 7 1- 72 (neglecting the
moment of the pair); this difference we call the shearing stress T in
the ring itself, and the total resulting force we designate by the letter
V and call the shearing force upon the ring. The notation originally
employed for the absolute value of the shearing stress and shearing
force is thus transferred to the finite increments of these quantities.
Finally, it is possible to simplify the expression for the effect of
the weight of the envelope itself, Gn ; this weight in practice amounts
to 10 or 20 per cent of the lift A · F. The weIght per unit area, g, is

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

221

resolved into a radial component g' COSa and a tanacntial component
g·sina . The former is oppositely directed to the internal pressure at
every point on the upper half of the envelope, and dirccted in the same
sense as the internal pressure at every point on the lower h alf. Its
magnitude, being proportional to cosa, is a linear function of the
vertical coordinate in the envelope when the cross section is circular,
and nearly linear when the cross section is oval. If we plot the
vertical coordinate as ordinate and the pressure as ab8cissa (fig. 78,
right-hand side), and then augment each abscissa by the corresponding
value of g' COSa, we obtain a straight line, dotted in figure 78. The
result is the same as if the original lift A were diminished by an

is not quite circular) a mean radius; i. e, as if the lift A were replaced
by a lift A ' , where

A'=A-k
The total lift or upward force upon the cross section F is therefore
A '·F=.A·F- k7rR2=A·F-g7rR=.A· F-~Gs
As could have been foreseen, the integral of the radial component
g'ds'cosa, taken over the entire circumference, is equal to one-half

the total weight of the ring.
The other half of Gs is accounted for by the tangential component.
This component is proportional to the sine of a.; it therefore depends
on a in the same way as does the shearing stress 'T, and its integral
corresponds to V. It may therefore be combined with the shearina
stress, the sum being a quantity proportional to sina, and the integra1
of the sum being

222

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The sign of V is so chosen that V is p ositive when directed upward,
as is the lift A' F.
The weight of the envelope may therefore be allowed for in computing the shape of the cross section by subtracting one-half of it
from the lift and the other half from the shearing force. The original

Figure 78 may now be replaced by the simpler figure 79, in which
only the pressure, the shearing stresses, and the suspension forces

entire lift must be balanced by shearing stresses having a downward
resultant,

Q=O. A.F= - V.

2. The weight exactly equal to the lift,

3. The weight either less than or greater than the lift; the difference must be balanced by shearing stresses with downward or upward resultant. This is the general case.

The mathematical development of this equation is carried out in
order to obtain an expression for the radius of curvature p; according
to Ritter, it is as follows:

Suppose the points Z to be moved downward, i. e., the girdle to be

points Z reach the bottom, and we have a load applied at one single
point, viz, the lowest point of the cross section. In this case the
radii of curvature for the entire circumf~rence are represented by a
single equilateral hyperbola.

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

227

The result to which the above reasoning leads, viz, that the lateral
tension (J is uniform over the entire circumference, was indicated by
the conclusion reached in the previous case (no load). For there
we found that the variations an (J were due to the shearing stresses T;
but these stresses vanish in the present case, the lateral tension being
balanced at every point by the internal pressure, which is directed
perpendicularly to the fabric . Consequently (J can vary only in
direction, not in magnitude.
THE PRACTICAL DETERMINATION OF THE SHAPE OF THE CROSS SECTION.

The equations just deduced do not completely determine the radii
of curvature in absolute magnitude for given values of pressure and
circumference, the value of the constant 0
not being fixed so far. We may proceed
by assigning successive arbitrary values of
o and plotting the corresponding hyperbolre p'Y = 0, and then determining from
these the corresponding values of pressure
and circumference. These values may be
plotted as curves, from which the shape of
cross section corresponding to given data
may be ascertained by interpolation.
This method is depicted in figure 83.
We begin with the limiting case, in which FIG. 82.-ReJstion between p and a.
the load is applied at the lowest point.
The hyperbolre plotted in the figure are those for which Po = 1,
Yo=6.25, and Po =l , Yo=3.71, respectively . An approximation to
the actual shape of the circumference is obtained by drawing arcs of
circles of the proper radii. The angle a is likewise introduced for purposes of contr6le. It is determined algebraically (fig. 81) as follows:

cos a =

H

(fO-A(Y02_y2)
(Jo

= -"---'-"-"------'<....!.

where ao=A'Yo' po, Po, so that

cos a = 1 - y~2 _ y2
Yo Po

If a is positive for points on the envelope above the center, the
sign is to be reversed for points below. Thus, for the lowest point
of the cross section shown on the left corner of figure 83, we have

cos au =

3.7P - 0.716 2
2'3' 71

1 =0.782.

In this manner we obtain a family of cross sections, apparently
corresponding to various values of the internal pressure but to only
a single value of the curvature at the top. The family, however
represents all possible cases; for all cases in which Yu/Yo, and, therefore, Pu/po, have the same value, give similar shapes for the cross
section, 1. e., shapes deviating in tb,e same way from the circle. The

228

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

value of the ratio PvJpo varies in practice from one-third to twothirds.
The deviation from the circle is given with sufficient exactitude
for practical work by the ratios of tile height H and the breadth B
to the diameter D of a circle of equal penmeter, together with the
value aU. of the angle a at the lowest point. These three quantities
were determined from the cross sectionsllotted by the method just
described- four in all-and are graphe in figure 84 (upper part)
as functions of tile ratio Pu./Po' In the same figure are graphed the
ratio of the radius Po to D, the ratio of Pu. to D, and the ratio of the
"elevation of the back" Yo-Ym to D.
The ratio of pressures Pv./Po is chosen as abscissa, because the value
of this ratio corresponding to any proposed values of diameter and
internal pressure may be found immediately, so that it is easy to
ascertain the shape of cross section corresponding to the proposed
conditions.

FIG. 83.

The shape of cross section in the case where the suspeD:si~n. is
attached higher up on the envelope can be deduced from the ltmltmg
case just discussed. To every mode of suspension (TakeZung)
corresponds a value of the "suspension ratio" (Takelungsver7Iiiltnis) ,
denoted by u and defined as the ratio of the length of the curve
OZ U to that of the curve-plus-straiO'ht-line OZL. (Fig . 81.)
When the load Q is applied at the fowest point, u= 1. In the other
extreme case, viz, that in which the suspension is attached at the
two ends of the greatest horizontal breadth of the envelope and the
directions of the two forces applied at these points intersect at
infinity, u=O. All the possible cases lie between these two extremes .
In figure 83 we see the shape of cross section for the case in which
the ratlO of su~pe~i~n (Umjangsverhaltnis, here doubtless meant for
Takelungsverhaltnts) IS taken equal to 0.733 . The upper half of the
envelope has the same shape as in the previous case where u = 1,

since it corresponds to the same hyperbola as before (e. g., to that
for which Po=l, Yo=3 .71, in the lower half of fig. 83) . We next
make a provisional estimate of the positions of the points Z , U,

been assumed) is determined, and so also is the height Yz which in

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

this case is equal to 1.866. From these three data we find, by
means of equation (12), page 226, the value of the difference P-Pl
between the two radii of curvature at the point of discontinuity Z .
This gives the second hyperbola; from this we plot the curve for the
lower part of the cross section, and find out by comparison whether
it agrees with the curve assumed. (As a rule, two corrections are
sufficient to make the agreement satisfactory.)
The "coefficients of tlie cross section," viz, the angle and the five
ratios defined on page 228, are then redetermined for the value U=
0.733, and plotted as functions of pu/po in figure 84 (center); note
that the angle au is here replaced by the angle E . As seventh coefficient there is introduced the ratio of the vertical distance from
Z to the top of the envelope, to the quantity D previously defined ;
this distance is denoted by Yo - YZ'
The second limiting case, that in which u = 0, is also shown in
figures 83-84 . It now becomes possible to graph the coefficients as
functions of the two variables, pressure and the suspension ratio,
simultaneously, i . e., as surfaces in three-dimensional coordinates.

FIG. 85.-Hcight and bread th of cross section as functions of pressure and suspension ratio.

The surfaces representing the deviation of the height and the breadth
from the values they would have if the cro s section were circular
are shown in figure 85 . It is obvious that the greater the pressure,
and the hi&:her up the points at which the suspension is attached,
the less is the deviation from the circle.
TRillD CASE: LOAD GREATER OR SMALLER THAN LIFT .

This is the most general case. It is compared with the special
cases I and II in figure 6, representing the lateral tension and the
radius of curvature as function of the vertical coordinate. In case I,
the radius is constant, and the tension increases uniformly from the
bottom upward, proportionally to the pressure . In case II, the
tension is constant over the back (i. e. above the girdle) and constant
over the belly (below the girdle), while the variation of the radius is
determined by the equilateral hyperbolre. In case III we distinguish between IlIa, in which the load Q is less than A · F, and
IIIb, in which it is greater than A · F . In the former case, the tension

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

231

attains its maximum at the top and its minimum at the bottom;
in the latter, it attains its maximum just above and its minimum
just below the girdle; and in neither case is it a linear function of
the vertical coordinates. The curve representing the radii of curvatUre is made up of two arcs, which in IlIa lie between the hyperbolre
of I and II, and in IlIb lie beyond that of II; these arcs are not
themselves hyperbolre .
It is clear that case III can not be treated in any simple way. It
would a:ppear best to employ a method of successive approximations,
by making a provisional assumption as to the shape of the cross
section; it is to be expected from case II that the curves forming the
cross section will be very similar to arcs of hyperbolre-and then

a provisional assumption as to the distribution of shearing stresses
(p . 217), which depends on the difference (Q - AF); the value of the
internal pressure being given, we may compute the lateral tension
u at each point of the circumference, and finally the radius of curvature u. If the values of p so computed agree exactly with the assumed
values, the assumed shape of cross section was correct; otherwise, the
clo eness of the agreement indicates the approach to correctness of
the assumptions, and may be used to guide the process of second approximation. This procedure, however, is very circumstantial and
tedious, and, as will be seen in the next section, may be evaded by
an interpolation scheme.
INFLUENCE OF THE SHAPE OF CROSS SECTION ON BENDING AND SHEAR.

The purpose of our investigation of the shape of cross section was,
to correct our previous computations of bending and shear. The
influence on the bending is due to the change of the · moment of
inertia J, in the equation

(Equation 10, p . 219.)

where B represents the moment of half the circumference, with
respect to th.e horizontal axis through the center of the cross section.
The values of J and S may be determined graphically from the
shape of the cross section (fig. 83) precisely as were the height and
breadth CR, B), and may be plotted as functions of two variables,
pressure and suspension ratio. This is done in figure 87. The two
surfaces represent the percentage change in J and in J/S, their
values for circular cross sections being taken as unity; they give
a good idea of the influence of the shape of cross section on bending
and shear.

PRAOTICAL APPLIOATION OF THE COMPUTATIONS OF BENDING AND
SHEAR.

A13 a rule, a balloon has only one value of the suspension ratio u,
this value being determined by the distance of the carfrom the envelope. Consequen tly, it is necessary to take only a single curve from the
surfaces of figure 87. On the other hand, it is desirable to know, for
any given value of u, the influence not only of the ratio of pressures
Pu/Po but also of the "ratio of loads" Q/AF. An idea of the last may
be gathered from the two following points :
1. If Q/AF=O (first case) !::,.J and !::,.(J/S) are zero .
2. If Q/AF= 1 (second case)!::,.J and !::"(J/ ) are given by figure 87.
3. In the third place, if the load is increased indefinitely the crosssection will contract into a vertical line of length 7rR, and J and J/S
will approach asymptotically to definite limits.
Consequently, if we plot the quantities !::,.J and !::,.(J/S) as functions
of the ratio of loads, x=Q/AF, the two curves have these characteristics : they pass through the origin x=O, y=O, through a known
pointx= 1, Y = b, and approach asymptotically the straight line y =a.
Furthermore, it is certain that J and S are monotonically increasing

233

functions of Q. Hence, if we draw through the two known points
and onward toward the asymptote a curve which is everywhere
concave downward and rising, without points of inflexion, this curve
will be a close approximation to the actual curve, especially as values
of the variable x as great as or greater than 3 are hardly ever attained
in practice. The simplest equation for such a function is
a·b·x
y (a -b) +b·x
which may be interpreted as follows: The straight line which has the
equation
a·b·x
y=b·x= (a - b) +b
is deflected downward by the introduction into the last term of the
denominator of the factor x, and approaches the asymptote y = a as x
increases indefinitely.

D. SPECIMEN COMPUTATION OF THE DEFORMATION OF AN ENVELOPE.

The following specimen computation is intended to serve the constructor as a conCIse summary of the individual computations necessary to determine beforehand the deformation to be expected with a
given envelope (the theory of the last section being always presupposed), these being arranged in what is the most practical and convenient order. At certain lllaces it will enable him to judge to what
extent it is permissible for him to simplify the procedure, considering the accuracy of the data at his command. Tliis being the purpose
of the present specimen, it is made general enough to include all the
separate computations heretofore explained, but otherwise as simple
as possible.

It is required, to ascertain the deformation of a nonrigid balloon of
12 meters ¢ ( ymbol used in the original; probably means diameter.Transl.) and 80 meters length, there being no load except the envelope
itself and the car (i. e. no balloonets, rudders, ropes (Fesselung) etc. ).
The car is suspended from two straight bands 40 meters long (Takelungsgurte) (cf. fig. 92 ) ; the individual forces (i. e. presumably those
exerted along the individual ropes) are all equal and uniformly distributed along the len~th of the belt (cf. fig. 78) and their directions,
prolonged backward, mtersect in one point A for the forces applied
to one belt, and in one point B for the forces applied to the other.
These points A and B appear in the cross-section diagram shown in
figure 92; in the longitudinal-section diagram of the same figure one
is directly behind the other at C. The suspension ratio is put equal
to 0.733; the lift A to 1 kilogram per cubic meter; the mean pressure
Pm to 30 millimeters of water; the weight of as quare meter of the
fabric to 0.5, the fabric being supposed to be diagonal doubled and
to be attached to the envelope in longitudinal strips.
The following dat~ are supposed to be known: The normal characteristic of fabric F of the table (cf. fig. 54, p. 197), and the shear
characteristic of fabric G (fig. 63, p. 205) this characteristic not being
known for F.
The computation is divided into five sections, corresponding to
figures 91 to 95.

The exact formula for the lateral tension has discontinuities at the

Correction for the increase in diameter due to the horizontal force
due to suspension, corresponding to the expansion curve (d) in figure
91.

of the diagram of figure 90 (p . 234); the value for the ratio of loads,

Comparison shows that the "uncorrected" values of the lastnamed quantities differ considerably in some cases from the "corrected" values, so that if the corrections to E and J are neglected
the result may be seriously in error; even though the three corrections to J appear separately to be very slight. Especially importan t

to a further correction not heretofore mentioned; the distinction
between :first approximation and second approximation values of
the normal tensions (pp . 171,210) should apply also to the bending
stresses. This correctIOn is worth making, however, only if the
determination of the normal characteristic can be made free from
arbitrary interpolations (d. pp. 197, 199) i considering what is said
on page 47, this seems quite feasible .

and thence, by a single integration, find the curve of shear. Here,
as previously, two curves have been drawn for each of the quantities
plotted, one curve for uncorrected and the other for corrected values.
The difference is distinctly less than in the last case, because the
corrections to G and to JIB influence the final results in opposite
senses. The statement just made about E applies also to G.
4. Add the bending and the shear (carried out only for the corrected values).
5. Plot the angle made by the plane of the cross section with the
vertical, this being equal to the angle whose tangent is the slope of
the line of centroids. (Fig. 94.)
6. Having plotted the line of centroids, draw outward from it, in
the planes of the cross sections, lines equal to the radii of the envelope as given in figure 91; connect the extreme points of these lines
by a curve, thus obtaining the outline of the envelope in its final form,
as seen from the side.
E. STUDY OF A MINIATURE LOADED IN AN ESPECIALLY SIMPLE
MANNER.

Certain measurements were made upon the miniature previously
used in investigating the planeness of the cross sections (p. 58), these
making it pOSSIble to form an idea as to the extent of the agreement
between the actual deformation and the deformation as predicated
from the normal and shear characteristics.
DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL AND THE MANNER OF LOADING.

The model was 1.5 meters long, and consisted of a cylindrical
central piece of 200 mm. <1>, with a hemispherical forward end and
a gradually tapering rear end. It was made by sewing together six
similar strips (I- VI) of fabric G, overlapping

equal to 3,000 mm. of water, first by filling it
with air and then by filling it with water. During the fust
tests, the bending and shearing forces were negligible; this state
is attained, when the model IS filled with air, simply by supporting it at the two ends (fig. 97), the weight of the model
being very small; when it is filled with water, the suspension is
attached at all the different loops (fig. 98). Thus the conditions
assumed in the discussion of page 207 are rea.lized. During the
second series of tests, the suspension was attaohed only at the four
middle loops on each side; bending and shearing forces then make
their appearance, and the conditions are similar to those in the case
of the gas-filled envelope. The reaction of the suspension is evenly
distributed among the eight loops by means of a system of equal-

produces is so considerable (in our case, equal in aU to about 11°)
that in long airships with several cars it may be the cause of decidedly
troublesome phenomena, and even in short airships generally makes
it necessary to change the positions of the rudders and steering
planes (Ruder und Richtfiossen).
INCREASE IN DIAMETER AND DECREASE IN LENGTH.

The increase in diameter and decrease in length were determined
three times-twice with the model supported Wlthout bending, once
with the bent model-by measuring the distances between pairs of
meridian lines and of transverse lines. The points plotted in
figure 105 represent mean values, averaged from observations on

deformation is not completed for a long time. The longitudinal
contraction as observed at the time of the second set of measurements
is not plotted, as the curve came very close to the curve obtained in
the third set, and would have made the diagram unclear.
In the second place, we observe a considerable variation of the
amount of the deformation from place to place along the length of
the evelope. Since the same oscillations of the curve appear in all the
curves at the same place , they must be due to inhomogeneities in
the fabric itself. It follows that the "many-cross metb.od " is the
most suitable for determining the normal characteristic, and that the
results it gives are better, the greater the number of the individual
points. In figure 105 the theoretical values of the quantities t::..d
and t::..Z , determined to second approximation from the normal characteristic (fig. 5 ) are graphed with broken lines.

A change in length becomes definitely an increase in the vicinity:
of the head of the b alloon. This is because the model is made of
only six strips, so that the head, instead of being a perfect hemisphere, is more like a hexagonal pyramid, and the central lines of the
strips (along which the change ill length is mea ured) are too short
in comparison with the seams, so that an unduly large longitudinal
tension falls upon them. In actual balloons there are 30, 40, or
more strips, and this phenomenon does not appear.
THE LI E OF CENTROIDS AND THE CURVE OF SHEAR.

The final form of the model, after three weeks of loading, was
determined from the photographs (figs. 68-69) which had been used
previously to test the validity of the N avier hypothesis. In figure
107 the contours of both photographs, enlarged and made according
to the principles given in connectiOn with figure 71, are reproduced.

with a curve, we obtain the line of centroids of the model (approximately). The shape of this curve is the same in both diagrams.
The cross-section planes are determined by the bits of paper
attached to the back and to the bottom. If, now, starting from M
and going in each direction, we draw a curve intersecting all the
cross sections at right angles, this curve enables us to separate the
effect of pure bending from that of shear.
The position of this curve is different in the two photographs.
This difference is partly due to small deviations from exact parallelism
of the two photographs, but principally due to the twisting of the
model; the bits of paper are glued exactly upon the top and bottom
meridian lines, particiJ;>ate in the twist of the miniature, and consequently do not remam in the object plane (fig . 70, portion marked
CI Grundriss"); this changes the apparent angles of the cross sections.
The phenomenon is especially clear in the upper photograph toward
the tail; the curve in question at first departs from the central curve
and then appro aches it again. Obviously, the upper photograph
(taken from the head end, cf. pp . 211-2 12) gives the better approximation near the head and the lower photograph (taken from the t ail

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

247

end) is better near the tail. However, since the absolute value of
the shear is small and the determination by this method not sufficiently exact to make conclusions from either photograph alone
reliable, the mean between the values obtained from the two photographs is employed in the computation.
COMPARATIVE COMPUTATION.

The computation of the form of the line of centroids is carried out
in figures 108, 109, and 110. It is simpler than the specimen computation (p. 234) in three respects:
1. The weight of the envelope can be neglected, for it amounts to
only 1.2 per cent of the weight of the water.

3. The ratio of suspension u is equal to zero, and the ratio of

The strengthening effect of the seams requires a correction of

REPORT NATIONAL ADVI SORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The theoretical curves agree qualitatively with the experimental.
The observed values of the deVIation from the straight line (due to
bending plus shear) are, however, about 15 per cent less than the
computed values. The portion of the deviation due to bending alone
agrees with theory to about 7 per cent. The portion of the deviation
due to shear is, however, some 30 to 35 per cent less than what was
expected. This is not to be wondered at. It is primarily due to the
fact that the shear characteristic, upon which the computation is
based, is determined from the central curves of the hysteresis loops
(fig. 61 ), whereas the observed deforma tion was the first which the
model had ever undergone, and it was to be expected that it would
be less than the computed deformation by an amount equal to the
influence of the viscosity (cf. fig. 20, p. 168) . If in figure 61 we com-

pare the values of the modulus of shear deduced from the central or
mean curves with those deduced from the initial curves, we find
throughout differences of 30 to 40 per cent. Hence this is a sufficient explanation for the difference between theory and experiment
in the present case; nevertheless it is desirable to test the matter out
by further experiments, especially upon shear. As regards the bending, however, the theory appears to be confirmed in every respect
by this trial.

The determination of the deformation of an actual envelope has
been separated into three parts, dealing successively with the increase
in diameter and decrease in length, the bending, and the shear. The
departure of the cross sections from the circular form has been ascertained, and a simple way of taking account thereof in computing
the bending and the shear is given.

THE DEFORMATION OF THE ENVELOPE OF THE SIEMENS·
SCHUCKERT AIRSIDP.
By

ALEXANDER

DIETZIUs, Dip!. Schiffbau-Ingenieur, Privatdocent in Airship Construction, R oyal T echnical High School, Berlin.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE AIRSHIP AND EXPERIMENTS UPON A MODEL.

The plans used in the construction of nonrigid balloons always represent the outer envelope as a surface of revolution, the cross sections
of which are circles in planes perpendicular to the axis. The patterns
for the longitudinal and transverse strips, from which the envelope
is put together, are designed and cut out of paper in conformity with
thIS assumption, upon which is likewise based the determination of
the volume.
Similarly, aU published construction plans of nonrigid balloons represent the body of the balloon as a surface of revolution. However, to
take two instances, the picture of P- VI. (fig. 1) and the longitudinal
section of the Siemens-Schuckert motor airship, drawn from measurements made some three months after its first filling (fig. 4), reveal
how far the envelope, after being mounted and filled with gas, deviates
from the initially designed shape.
The change from the planned shape of cross section into a pearshaped form is, in practIce, less notIceable. This is due in part to
the increase of internal pressure with height inside the balloon after
it is filled with a ~as lighter than air (in general, hydrogen); and
diminishes as the mternal pressure is increased, whether by ventilators 1 (BalZonventiZatoren) or otherwise.
The change in the shape of the longitudinal section, especially in
the contour of the back, is more striking. This is not merely an
esthetic defect, especially in comparison with the rigid airships of
the Zeppelin type, but a practical fault, which certainly does not
contribute to increasing the speed of the airship.
When the ratio of length to breadth (Strec7cungsverhiiltnis) is considerable-thus, in the Siemens-Schuckert airship it is 9 to I-and the
central cylindrical portion is long, the bends appear still more clearly.

far out to front and rear being stretched taut. Such appliances are
entirely lacking in the Siemens-Schuckert airship; however, it was
possible to correct the worst of the deformations by inserting wedgeshaped pieces of fabric at the points of greatest curvature.
A comparison of figure 5 and the photograph in figure 7 shows as
well as possible the success thus attained. So far as I know, this is the
first nonrigid balloon to which such a correction has been applied.
The expenence here acquired, in particular that in the drawing of
figure 4, will make it possible to provide better against the bending
whenever a new balloon of this shape and size is built; in particular,
the patterns for the strips of fabric will be drawn so as to allow for
a much larger number and better distribution of the wedge-shaped
insertions.
The requirements imposed by the purchaser of dirigible balloons
have become much more exacting in the last few years, because of the
great competition; consequently, the builder of nonrigid balloons will
find himself compelled to attach importance and value to the beauty
of his ships. The publication of a portion of the experiences and
investigatlOns of tlie Siemens-Schuckert factory relatively to the
deformations of the envelopes of nonrigid balloons will therefore be
of general interest.
DETERMINATION OF THE DEFORMATIONS BY COMPUTATION AND BY
GRAPHS.

This has been carried out for the Siemens-Schuckert envelopes. It
is here superfluous to take up the process of computation, as it has
been thoroughly and generally treated in the previous paper. It is
there shown that the results of the computatlOn are in good agreement with experiment when the assumptions there made in order
to simplify the computations are justified to a sufficient approximation.
However, in computing the bending of the envelope of the S. S. airship (fig. 3) the influence of the shearing forces 1 which causes a di placement of the cross sections was entirely neglected; at that time
the properties of the fabric employed (three-layer fabric) which affect
this phenomenon were not known. Furthermore the existing data
on the expansion of the fabric (or the characteristics determining
the expansion) were incorrect. They were obtained by experiments
on a cylinder of the fabric about a meter long and 30 cm. in diameter,
the tension in the fabric being increased by increasing the internal
pressure and the expansion being determined by measuring the
circumference. This series of tests the maximum tension attained
in which was 500 kg. per meter extended over only half an hour;
consequently no account was taken of the peculiar property of
balloon fabric emphasized in the previous paper viz, the property
of approaching the final defonnation corresponding to a given load
only asymptotically as a result of which the deformations produced
by the permanent load to which the balloon is subjected when in
use are greater than those found by the experiments, and the value
employed for the modulus of elasticity throughout the computations
was too great. The fact-at first surprising to the constructors and

builders of the S. S. airship-that the actual bending was roughly
10 times as great as that computed, is thus expl ained.l
Another surprise, this time an agr eeable one, was furnished by
the f act th at the balloon developed n o creases on the under side,
even at zero pressure (an deT B auchseite nicht einknickte) , while the
compu tation mdicated that this phenomenon-due to the annulling
of the tension on th e extreme upper or lower filament of the envelope-would appear at an excess pressure of 11 millimeters of
water. The reason is that in the computation the influence of the

suspension was neglected; this increases the cross sections as the
internal pressure goes down, so that the moments of inertia of the
cross sections increase.
D ETERMINATION OF THE DEFORMATION OF THE HYDROGEN- FILLED
BALLOON .

This method is the most exact, although the most expensive;
since the required corrections can be ascer tained beforehand only to
a very rough approximation an d at the cost of much time, as is shown
1 Although this is underst ood, other difficulties remain in the computation of the deformation, especially
for a balloon of the S. S. t ype. These are due to our ignorance of the distri bution of tensions at the places
where t he fabric suspension (Stoffbannaffhangung), peculiar t o this t ype, ends and the head and tail
of circular cross section begin. Hence the" water model tests" later to be described simplify considerably
the task of computing the deformation of a huli of the present type.-Author's note.

to the floor (Abloten des Ballons auj dem Boden), thus obtaining, by
comparison with the longitudinal section, the ratio of the greatest
to the least diameter for each cross section.
The results of the measurements are given in figure 6; they show
very clearly that the deformation of the cross section, other things
b einO' equal, increases with the specific load, so that indentations
Bujten) appear in the envelope at the places where the gondolas
are suspended; these are more pronounced, the less the artificial
excess pressure in the balloon. Compare also the photograph in
figure 8, in which the constrictions are indicated by arrows.
By measuring the circumference and the length it was found that
the former had increased by roughly 7 per cent over the intended
value, while the latter h ad diminIshed by only 1.5 to 2 per cent.
We see further in figure 6 that the central line of the horizontal
projection of the envelope is not straight. The cause lies in an annoymg peculiarity of the diagonal fabric employed, which was first demonstrated beyond doubt by the previously mentioned experiments on
the properties of fabrics. The difference between the susceptibility
to extension of the wary and that of the woof in the principal layer,
and the uniformly applied diagonal strips, cause the envelope of the
banoon to undergo a twist around the longitudinal axis; this effect
is partially compensated by the weight of the gondolas, but the tension on one side of the balloon is increased thereby, a sharper constriction is produced, and a curvature of the axis is caused.
This appears much more strongly in the K6rting balloon belonging
to the Austrian army authorities; even the pictures, e. g., those published in the Deutsche liujtjahre:r-Ze:itschrijt, show the twist distinctly.
This type of deformation can in the future be avoided by employing strips of fabric, in which the diagonal layer is laid down partly
as if wmding a right-handed, partly as in a left-handed screw, so
that the twisting tendency due to it is canceled. A J>atent covering
this improvement has been filed for some time in nearly all countries
by the Siemens-Schuckert Co.

DETERM INATION OF THE DEFORMATION BY EXPERIMENTS ON MODELS.

This method, so far as I know, was first employed by the Italians,
and was briefly described by Capt. Crocco in the periodical La
Technique Aeronautique for June 1, 1911. It consists in making a
model of the large balloon, out of the same fabric, of such dimensions
and filled with water to such a pressure that the specific tensions at
various points on the model are equal to those at the corresponding
points or the balloon. When this condition is fulfilled, the specific
expansions, extensions, and displacements in the model must be
equal to those in the oriO'inal, and the deformations, measure for
measure, must be identic~. The algebraic proof of this statement
will be adduced later on, during the description of the experiments
performed by the author in the service of the Siemens-Schuckert
factory.
It should :first be mentioned that these experiments could also be
performed by submerging the model in water and :filling it with air
(fig. 11); but the measurements would then have to be made under
water, which is not convenient. It should be noted beforehand that
the results make no claim to completeness, espeoially since the weight

of the large envelope can not be reproduced in the model. Comparison of the deformation of the model with that of the original has
shown, however, that the method is in practice completely satisfactory.
SCALE OF THE MODEL.

For the adjacent shallow cylindrical cross se'ction of a balloon
(fig. 9) let Pa represent the external, Pi the internal pressure. Both
of these vary, as is known, according to the law

Let OX be the horizontal plane, in which the two pressure curves
intersect, i. e., where Pa = Pi; for example, i.n the case of a completely
filled sph~rical balloon OX is the plane in which lies the lower end
of the fillmg tube (FulZansatz) .
The shape of the cross section is completely determined when the
radius of curvature P is given for every point of t.he circumference.

The seale of the model is thus completely determined when a value
is assigned to the ratio tit', or any relation between t and t' is assigned.
As aIready mentioned, it is desirable to make the model out of the
same fabric as the large balloon, for then we obtain the same specific
extensions when the specific tensions t and t' are made equal. Assigning the value 1 to the ratio tit', we obtain

a' = "I' a - "I'i is more constant, since the density of water "I' a varies
only slightly, and the density of air "I'i is negligible in comparison

DISTRIBUTION OF FORCES OVER THE MODEL.

The scale of the model was determined as

Let the volume of the large balloon be V, that of the model V',
then the ratio of volumes is
V=nsV'.
The total load that the balloon is able to carry is 0 = V'a where, as
above, a r epresents the lifting power of the contained gas per cubic
m eter. The weight of the water inside the model is 0' = V' a', where
a' =1000 kg. per cubic meter. Hence

In this ratio the weight of the gondolas, that of the waterl that
of the benzine ballast, etc., are to be computed and evaluated, ill the
case of the water-filled model, as forces directed upwards; this is
sb.own in fi~ure 10, and is easy to carry out. The proper allowance
for the weigbt of the envelope, however, can not
be correctly made unless
we reduce it in the same
ratio and imagine it as
distributed in the correct
way over the entire surface of the envelope of the
model (cf. fig. 10). The
weight of the envelope of
the model itself is directed
in exactly the opposite
sense when the model is
filled with water and is
directed in the sense desired only when the envelFIG, 10,
ope is fill ed with air and
submerged under water. (Fig. 11.) Even then the effect of the
weiO'ht of the model would not be analogous to that of the weight
of the envelope; for, since the envelope of the model is of the same
fabric as that of the balloon, its weiglit stands to the weight of the
balloon in the ratio of the areas, i. e., in the ratio
HIH' =n2/1 , or H ' =H

whereas the ratio ought to be the same as that of 0' to 0, i. e.

Since a' /a is approximately 1000, the weight of the envelope of the
model is only one-thirtieLh of the r educed weight of the envelope of
the balloon. Consequently, in order to make proper allowance for
the weight of the envelope in the set-up of figure 11 it would be
necessary to make the model out of fabric about 30 times as heavy
(per unit area) as the fabric of the balloon. This would scarcely be
possible in practice.
On the other hand we see that in the set-up with the water-filled
model, although the .weig~t of the model itself acts in the opposite
sense to the one desIred, Its influence can not be great, since it is
equal to only about one-thirtieth of the r educed weight of the balloon
envelope.
Since, with nonrigid balloons, the weight of the envelope is onequarter to on~-third the tot~l lift, it can not be entirely neglected.
In the experIments here pIctured allowance was made for it by

inserting an air sack, extending the entire lengLh of tre model (see
fig. 12) of such capacity, that the weight of water displaced by it
was equal to the r educed weight of the envelope, includina- valves,
tubes, etc. Furthermore, the cross sections of this air saclr are so
design ed that the dis1.ribution of weight (of displaced water) along
the lon~itudinal axis is as closely similar as pOSSIble to that of the
reduced. weight of the envelope.
It must not be overlooKed that the r educed weighL of the envelope,
as thus introduced, causes the shape of the envelope (cross section) to
be incorrectlyreproduced, the height of the cross section being increased
and the breadth diminished, relatively to what they would be if the
reduced weight were properly distributed (cf. fig. 10). This fault
can be partly corrected by increasing the internal pressure beyond
the va.lue 'previously computed, h' =h/n; for this increase makes Lhe
cross sectIOns broader in the horizontal, narrower in the vertical
direction. However, the tensions in the envelope of the model increase likewise, so that t' > t.

REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

261

The desired broadening of the horizontal diameter may be obtained
without introducing this last error, if we make the scale of the model
less than 1: 30. For, from the equation for the scale of the model,

t·a'
t'·a

n2 = -

it is seen that n becomes larger than 30 when t' is made greater
than t. If, therefore, n 1 is made greater than 30, it will be necessary
to increase the internal pressure beyond the value h' =hln, in order
to make t' equal to t. For a cerLain value of the scale factor 11.1 > 30,
the error introduced by the scheme of figure 12 for making allowance for the reduced weight of the envelope is as nearly annulled as
possible.
We observe, however, in the above equation for n2, that t' becomes
equal to t for a value of the scale-factor n 1 greater than n, when the
lifting power per cubic meter of the hy drogen is less than 1.1-a case
whicli is more frequent in practice than the converse one in which

the condition previously announced, it will still be necessary to
increase the internal pressure h'.
The increase, dh', ill h' which is necessary can be computed only
approximately, by means of the assumption that, when the internal
pressure is increased by dh, the shape of the cross section does not
change-i. e., that, even after the increase takes place, the radius
of curvature p' is equal to lin times p. This is not actually true;
for the cross section must broaden a little in the horizontal and
contract in the vertical direction.

The experiment to be described in what follows was made for a
proposed balloon, of which the plans are given in figures 14 and 16.
This balloon was to have the same length as the S. S. balloon, from
which it was to differ only in having a greater volume, every diameter
being magnified in the same ratio.
The model is made out of three~layer diagonal fabric. As regards
its strength and its properties with respect to extension, it corresponds
to the fabric previously used for the S. S. balloon. This, however,
was made of 42 longitudinal strips, while the model was made out
of only 8; this was done in order to make the strengthening due
to the unavoidable seams stand in the same ratio to the (stren~th of
the) seamless fabric as in the case of the large balloon, although
adjacent strips overlapped by only 9 mm. on the model and by 30 mm.
on the balloon. The arrangement of the strips and seams is shown
in the projected cross sectIOn (fig. 16) and the photograph of the
model as filled with air (fig. 17). The scale factor is 1: 33} instead
of 1: 30, for reasons explained above.
The reduced weight of the envelope was allowed for by means of an
air sack, and the other weights by heavy sandbags of suitable weight,
with the aid of double~armed levers, wire ropes, and movable locks
nachstellbare S pannschlOsser). Similar compensation was made
for the weight of the horizontal rudders, the stabilizing planes, and
the ropes at the forward end (Naserifesselung). (Cf. also the pictures,
figs. 17,24, and 25). The weight of the envelope of the mouel, including the air sack and the clamps Cillrmmvorrichtungen), was offectively
annulled by means of cast-iron riders, which could be moved at will
along the levers.
After the model was filled with water the water pressure was raised

hence h'+dh=682+194=876 mm., water pressure required, measured in millimeters of water.
The shape of the transverse section is shown by the :photograph
(fig. 18) and two scale diagrams (fig. 19). It agrees wIth that of
the large balloon very well, so far as comparison is possible, i. e.,
in the ratio of height to breadth.
The change of the shape of the longitudinal section must, naturally,
also correspond to that of the large balloon; for, when the distribution of the weights applied to the model corresponds to that for the
balloon, each :portion of the envelope will be subjected to the same
specific forces In the ca e of the model as in the case of the original.
Consequently the specific extensions and the displacements must be
the same.
Since the tensions change from point to point, any given change in
the balloon is reproduced by a change on the model over a distance
only l in times as great. Erroneous results may be caused by this
circumstance, and also by the fact that the strengthening influence
of the seams, etc., in the balloon, can be reproduced only approximately in the model; the errors, however, are of subordinate importance in comparison with the considerable deformations due to
the extensibility of the fabric, as is seen by comparing the pictures
of the longitudinal section of the model with that of the balloon
(fi<Ys. 15 and 20 with fig . 4).
~igure 21 shows also the horizontal projection of the model when
filled with water; the constrictions produced by the gondolas,
exactly as in the case of the lar<Ye balloon (fig. 6), oan be recognized.
Experiments wi th a model of this type therefore make it possible at
relatively slight cost to foresee the deformation of a proposed balloon
even at the time when the patterns for the fabric are being made.
Other valuable information can be obtained in this way; for example,
information about the ohange in volume, which depends upon the
extension of the fabric and upon the distortion of the cross sections
from the original oircular form, and which, in the determination of
the volume of the balloon, can (as mentioned at the beginning)
be ascertained only by experience; further information about the
position of the center of gravity of the volume (Volumenschwerpunkt)
whioh is displaced by the deformation of the envelope, so that the position computed from the diagrams i not oorrect. If a mistake is made
in this matter it is necessary subsequently to change the position qf
the loads; if the gondolas are suspended by a rope suspension
(Seiltakelage) from the balloon, it is ordinarily easiest to make the
change by displacing them. If, however, the gondolas are suspended
by means of a strip of fabrio (Sto
ifaufhangung) , as is the case with
the S. S. balloon, It is much more difficult to make the correction.

In the determination of the center of gravity of the volume it seems
advisable to perform two experiments; one, during wh.ich the air
sack of figure 12 is inserted, and the other, during which it is left out.
In the latter case it is necessary to add the reduced weight of the
hull to the weight of the gondolas;
but the volume of the air sack and

the po ition of its center of gravity,
'which is hard to determine, do not
enter into the computation. On the

Figure 22 shows the results of an

roughly, 12 per cent. When the

on the large balloon itself, the volume dimirnshed by only 8 per cent

This difference is due to the fact

inserted; this, as already stated,
causes an excessive stretching of the cross section. This stretching
is obviously greater the smaller the internal pressure.
A change m volume equal to about 8 per cent corresponds to a
change in the temperature of the gas within by about 22° centigrade,
or to a change of about 60 mm. in the barometer.

It follows that the S. S. balloon does not require an .Amme 1 to
compensate the ohanges in volume produced by the changes in pressure or temperature encountered over a period of a few days in the
S. S. hall. This is, however, true only if the weights (gondolas, etc.)
are so distributed that the bending stresses which they exert upon
the hull cause no creases or dents, even when the pressure on the
underside of the balloon is zero. The advantage of such a property
in a balloon is, not merely that the .A.mme and its cost are avoided,
but also that the hydrogen content of the balloon (the loss by diffu ion
being made up by fresh additions) deteriorates only slightly. A nurse
balloon increases the surface of the balloon immensely, the influence
of' diffusion (inward as well as outward) being correspondingly

is sucked into it. (Noell, unangenehmer macht sich der Vmstand

could doubtless be lessened by making the nurse balloon of very ga tight, i. e., heavily rubberized fabric, instead of the customary light
two-layer cloth.
The experiments u:pon the model may be extended so as to cover
the cases of deformatIOn due to bending stresses which are produced
by forces acting in the horizontal plane, and likewise those due to
additional moments in the vertical plane.

For example, bendin~ moments in the horizontal plane are caused
during flight when the nelm is shifted (duTch Legen des Seitensteuers).
The flexions thus produced are, in the S. S. balloon, rather considerable, partly beca~se of the high. r atio of le1?-gth to di.ameter; however,
they appear also ill the Zeppelins, according to Chief Engmeer Dorr
of the Zeppelin factory.1
Figure 23 presents the determination of the curve representin~ the
bendmg moment due to the pressure of the rudder, for the ij. S.
airship, and b ased upon the assumption that the reaction of the air
upon the envelope tends to cause only a rotation around the center of
gravity of the balloon. The values of the bending moment obtained
upon this assumption are minimum values, for, when the airship is
advancing through the air, the reaction is displaced far forward toward
the head of the balloon and the maximum bending moment is doubled

model, consequently the results given are of value only in comparing
different models and different balloons with one another.
Since, with our fabrics, the deformation produced by a given constant stress depends on the length of time that the stress IS applied
and approaches its maximum value asymptotically, it is necessary to
extend these experiments over a long interval of tIme. A number of
observations are made successively at greater and greater intervals,
and the experiment is tenninated when the flexion ceases to increase
perceptibly. From the graphs of figures 26 and 27 we see that this
point is reached in about 50 hours.

The measurements of flexion after the load is removed are interesting in this respect, that they cOnTIrm the conclusion deduced from
the experiments on deformation of fabrics mentioned at the beginning, viz, that the flexion, imparted to a nonrigid balloon by
bending stresses, never entirely vanishes when these are removed.

neither are they very systematic, as appears from the present account.
In particular the e~eriments so far performed relate only to a type
of full balloon, and even for this case the magnitude of the errors
introduced along with the simplifications is not completely investigated. A well-planned repetition and development of the experiments would form a worthy task for one of the laboratories, already
existing or coming into existence, for the study of aeronautics. The
chief purpose of the present publication is to stimulate such an
attempt .
