INTRODUCTION.
The purposes of the
erimental inm&gw50n on the performance
of air ropelkrs desoribe in the following report were as folIowe:
Y
(1) he
development of a series of dfactors and ooef%eients
drawn from model forms distributed with some regulari~ over the
field of air-propeHer design and intended to furnish a baem of cheek
with si.mikr work done in other aerodynamic Iaboratoriw+ and as a
point of departure for the further study of special or mdividusl
types and forms.
(2) The establishment of a series of experimental values derived
from modeIa and intended for later use as a basis for comparison
with similar re+ndtsdrawn from certain sekoted full-sized forms and
tested in free flit.
The report oomprises three parts, as folIows:
1: The ayodynemio laboratory at Stanford University and the
w ment mstalIed withs eoial refeyxme to tests on air propellers.
v
Tests on 48 model ?orms of mr repellers, with analysis and
disc&sion of results and presentation of the same in graphical form.
III. A brief discussion of the law of similitude as a.ilecting the
relation between the results derived horn model forms and those to
be~mici~ded from full-sized forms.

The curve OEBF was then assumed as a graphioal history of the
air speed on distarm%the part from O fn A referring to the colleotor

a smooth continuous curve showing easy and gradual aooeleration
and retardation as distributed along the &stance axis CD. It was
then thought desirable to ju e the same distribution of valooi~
but on a tune axis. To this en the transformation indicated in the

Again considering the oollector asalargeozzle into which the air
is flowing as the result of a reduction of ressure in the experiment
chamber and under the welI-lmown laws ?or the flow of gases, it was
found that the dumgas in density involved were too smtill to introduce any sensib~e change in the law of the distribution of velocity
for the section areas assumed, or in the section areas for the velocities
as shown by the accepted curve.
Ik this gaueral man er the curves for the two park of the tunnel
were determined. Actually, of coruw+,the width of the experimmt
chamber intervenes at the throat point A, but this fact does not

DETAILS CONSTRUCHON.
OF
No attempt will b? made to give full structural details of the equiyment. These must m any case be determined largely by the special
circum.dmcea of the case. A few of the more important structural
features may, however, be noted.
The form of the collector and dHuser tubes was determined by
circular frames made by nailing up a double ring of seven-eighths
inch board segments, sawn to the proper curvature on one side, thus
forming a strong ring of wood l% inches thick. These rin~ were then
faetened to uprights made of 2 b 4 inch scantli spaced about 2 feet

tem and hence must expect an inorease of velocity of air stie~
??& eftect on the air stremn wiU &o be twofold, as follows:
“
(I) Iacal and immediately in front of the model propalkr, where
there will be acceleration of the sires it approaches the repeller.
(2) Outeide the immediate local influence of the m 0? cl propdler
where there will bean increase in air stream velocity due to the greater
amount of ener~ supplied in the circuit and a corresponding reduction in pressure m the experiment room with consequent general increase in thes eed of inflow. It was, therefore, important to asc=tain whetha & e enertd velocity of air stream as indicated by that
of the cylindricals% ell about the repeller still remained in the same
rekdioniw tiefflof~Wmetith
tie~&ntroon
Careful tmd repeats teets showed that this was the case and it was,
therefore, assumed that the combined action of the large fan propeller
and the model ro dler was to produce a mdoci~ of wind stream in
the cylindrical &el surrounding the modeI, standing in the given and
fixed relation ta the depression caused in the room by the joint action
of the two propdlem. This veloci@ of wind stream then corresponds
to the indefiuts stream flowing wound and outside of the repeller
in the case of an airplane in tiee flight and is, therefor~, to ! e taken
to the velocity of fli& through the W.
“ Smular y the coal result immediately in front of the model pro@C9T”Y?
ler is to be taken as similar to the local acceleration of the air unmediately in front of the airplane propeller, causing a local flow of air
aft to meet the forward moving propeller.
RWA’ITON BETWEEN DLWETEBS OF WIND STREAM AND DIAIM13133R
OF MODEL PROPELLER.

It was assumed from precedent and from general qerience
in
wind-tunnel work that a propeller model 3 feet in diemeter cotid be
roperly run in a wind stieam 5* feet diameter without sensible
&“sturbance at the boundarks of the stream and hence with sensibly
the same result as though in an indefinite stream.
The experimented examination of this question was approached
from thee differ~t directions, as follows:
(a) Successive reduction of wind-strewn dismetw with comparati~e study of thrust end torque -cients.
(b) Pitot tube survey of wind stream with model propekr in
opwation, with speciaI reference to distribution of -reIocity in the
cylindrical shell outside the tip circle of the repeller.
(c) Comparison of tit
and torque co & cienta for four sizes of
pro el.leraof successive increasing diameters.
& e rwcdts of these & sc exemirmtions may be briefly indicated.
The diameter of the wind stream was reduced by 6-inch steps by
bkmking over the deliv
end of the collector with suitable flat
annular ringg. This had %! e ef!iectof closing off an outer zone of cells
of the honeycomb bsflle, leaving the remainder operative. This ave
wind streams of diameters, successively, 66, 60, 54, and 48 in % es,
and within which a pro eUerof 3 feet chsmeter was run. The results
were then reduead to i e form of thrust and .@rque coeilicients by
assuming, at equal values of V’/llll, a force variation with the square
of the speed.
The torque and thrust ooeilicient curves thus derived give the
following indications: The torque and thrust of the 3-foot model in

For a wind stream 4 feet diameter the tmque and thrust were 6

inregardtot %s important question, foupro~ellers

eometricfdly, were tested out in r & ar course and the resxdts re%

of V/lVD, a force variation with the uare of the speed and with the
s uare of the diameter. The results 7 them tests are shown in @ures

increase$ to 42 inches, or possibly even to 48 inchee, and run in a
wind stream of diameter 66 inches tithout sensible departure from
the conditions in an indefinite stream.
As a mattar of fact, ss maybe noted in the figures, the values of
the coef6cients for the diameters 30, 42, and 48 inches lie most satiefaotoril on a continuous smooth curve. Those for the diameter 36
inchee i?e slightly above. This slight variation is apparently due to
some slight de arture in geometrical similarity between the proPeUerfor 26-in%diameterand theotherthree.
In any event these results together with the others nohd above
seem to pdify fully the use of the propeller models of 36 inohes diameter in the wind stream of 66 inches diametar.

ossible in a re resentative way over the field of ropelbr deeign.
!& e purpose o ? this selection was to establish a i efinite series of
design conetanta and data for these t es aud characteristics and

The wind speed was detmmined by reading, simultaneouel~ with
the other observations, the de ression in the room. This mth the
relation established by Pitot tu\ e ccdibration gave the velocit head,
and this with the density gave the speed. It maybe noted d ~t the
relation between the Pitot tube measurement of velocit y head and the
manometer measure of the depression was determined day by day as
a matter of routine, but was not found to var more than I per
cent from that given by the ratio 0.876 as note x previoudy.
The revolutions per sticond were determined by taking the length

period of some 10 seconds 1 “qg on either side of the instant of

revolutiom through the faotor 50 per inoh and hence the relation
between revolutions and time determined. It maybe noted that the
nature of the record waa such as to permit a reading of revolutions to
on-tenth of one revolution per second.
The thrust, as has been previously noted was read directly from
the weights and rider on the scide beam. T!he balance was semitive
to about one two-hundredth of a pound, and imduding tight perturbations the readings could norrdy be made to one om+hundredth
of a poun C#

The torque moment was read from the circular scale as nohd in
connection with the description of this part of the equipment. The
reading, inclu “ perturbatio~, could usual~ be made to one-tenth
of one division o the scale whmh corr=pon L to 0,007 pound-foot.

‘When the tat was oompleted the propeller was a ain re laced by

It is, howev~, determinable for any specific case by experimental

Form as such may, of cuurse, be determined b geometrical

dimensiop. In detail, however, unless of some defina le ehar~ctirj
s. form vnll r uire a vast (at the limit an i.niinite) number of &mensione for its 3 extermination. If, therefore, the forms of the bodies
A and B were dissimilar, a vast number of geometrhal measures and
dimensions would r uire to be included in the functions under consideration. Due to% is fact, no attempt has been made to deyelop
or use any such functional relation except in the case of bochee or
forms which exhibit some considerable degree of geodetical sipi.kwity
and which permit of detition in terms. of a small number of congeometriwd

Thus sp%eres are defined by the diameter phs the
characteristic of sphericity, cylinders by the diameter and the length
plus the characteristic of a constant circular cross section.
A@n with the assumption of com~lete geometrical similarity

therefore, arise as to whether there is anypmuue~~%a$i%!?!~;

If, then, these general conditions and assumptions are accepted,
it is clear that between the two values of the force F for the two bodies
A and B fmmtioning under suitably related sets of conditions, there
will exist a determinable relatioq, and a value for A found experimentally may be used to determme the corresponding value for B,
or vice

t

versa.

From this analysis it wilI be clear that the justification of this
general rocedure WW depend on the following:
(1) &ether all the variables, pmametms and conditions u on
which the force relation depends are, as a matter of fact, includ e% in
thelist ofa,
b,c.
..z,
g,z.
..represented
in the
fornnda.
(2) Whether, in point of fact, equality ‘of condition between the
two bodies, such as quaIity of surface or eometrical form, is ~
justification for assuming equal vaIue9 of the $ unction #a.
The latter of these two conditions merits some further consideration. It rais= immediatdy the questions:
Does geometrical form as such, and independent of absoluta
dimension, constitute an independent
detamimn g characteristic
for
force reIations such m tiose under present consideration?
Does quality or material, or texture of surface (expressed usually
in#ms
of smoothness
or ro
huess), constitute
an independmt
rminin
characteristic
for T orce ? and in pmtictiar,
to what
extent is $ e assumption
of
eometrical
form as an independent
parameter inconsistent
with 8 e assumption
of equality
of surface
texture or smoothness?
Regarding
the latter point, it is clear that, carried to the Iimit
necessary in order to include molecular or short range forces such
as those responsible for the formation of fmrbuh+~e near the skin of
a body movmg in a mobile medium, geometrical clarity
and equal
degrees of smoothness are mutually inconsistent.

tuting texture or roughness of surface. E ual degrew of roughness
or like qualities of taxture in bodies of d erent over-all dimension
implies a lack of geometrical similarity carried to the limit of surface
texture.
Again including forces of molecular order the question may arise
as to the influence of the actual substance of the surface as between
the two bodies A and B.
It seems clear that no course of abst~ct reasonin can serve to -%
defitiil
dekmine the extant of inconsistency w “ch may be
involve i in these considerations. It seems equally olear that we
must admit that the assumption of equal values of @a resulting from
is assumed to depend,
similar qualities or conditions on which
does not rest on an entirely rational foun $ ation; or otherwise that
such assure tion can not be justified by abstract reasoning and the
extent tow L “ch it may be justified must, therefore, be sought ultimately in actual expermuce.
We &d further, in some casesj ‘fhaK it seems dwirable to omit
the influence due to certain parameters

in the a, b, c
class.
In suoh cases a in it is clear &at experience

“
d ving in view then the general problem and remembering

The form of equation (+t) is then equivalent to the asaum t.ion that

geometrically

related as the densitiw of the media, as the squares of the diameters
and as the squares of thes

The forms of equations (3 Y, (4) have been developed on the assumption that the force in question is any characteristic
force such as

The same general form and involving
the same functions
for the make up of P will obviously hold for any other force.
Hence

T%e law of kmomatic similitude, as actually applied, involves, therefore, the possibility of error under two heads:
(a) Departure from the conditions needed to insure e ual values
of the function 4 so far as dependent on the a, 3, c class o1 variables,
and as discussed just above.
0) Departure from the conditions needed to insure e ual values
of the function tpso far as dependent on the z, y, z class o1 variables,
and as discussed at an earlier poin$
With these two possibilities in me-ivit will be appsrwd that in its
practical application the law of kinematic similitude must rest its
8UthOrnt and utility u orI actual experience. To thISend there are
needed T
urther carefuU! conducted ex er@ents on models and fuLly

to furmeh a somewhat more defimtt-measure of the tiuence of thwe
various departures from the indicaiad conditions.
With such relation established and expressed in koms of a series
of factors or percentages, the use of the data derived from model
experiments would be attended by in~eased cotidence as to reliabtity and general availabtit y for deagn purposes.
