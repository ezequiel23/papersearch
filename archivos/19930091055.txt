THEORY OF AN AIRPLANE ENCOUNTERING GUSTS, IN.

wnaoN.

The folIowing is an immediate continuation of my two previous papers on & same subject which appeared in these Reports, First Year, pagm 52-75, and Third Year, pages 405-431,
the latter being a reprint of my contribution to the Procee&gs American Philosophical Society
(Philadelphia), vohune 56, pages 212-248. In my second paper I pointed out: (1) That the
study of a guet of the type J& sin pt, tuned both in damping and in period to the natural
motion of the machine, might be impori%nt; (2) that the solution for this case by Brodetsky
treated only the particular integral without taking account of the fact that the constanta of
integration in the complementary function n@ght be such as largely to upset any conclusion
that such a gust produces violent motions; (3) that a new method for solving linear equations
had been developed by Bromwich, which was suited to determine the motion for any particular
gust, when the machine started from equilibrium, without the trouble of determkhg the
constants of integration in the complementary function.
I shall now apply Bromtich’s method to the calculation of the tiect of a head-on gust of
the form u, =J@
sin pt where n= .0654, p= .187, as in the case of the slow oscillation for
the C!@& JN2. lkssmuch as the method depends on the use of the theory of functions of a
complex variable, which is a mathematical subject of prime importance to any aeronautical
engineer who would have that knowledge of fluid motion which is regarded in high quarters as
essential, and further inasmuch as neither the theory of functions nor Bromtich’s special
method is likely to become as fdar
as they should be to engineers or physicists without
detailed directions for and exampks of the application of such ways of calculating, I may be
pardoned for the somewbt lengthy presentation of matters elementary for the pure mathematician.
Suppose it be required to solve the equation

with the supposition that the damped harmonic force on the right is applied at and from the
time t= O, and that at t= O the system is at rest in its position of equilibrium, i. e., x= O and
dx/dt = o.
Now trigonometric tmms are generally treated by their exponential equivalents, through
the formulas

The solution of (1) may be obtained by solving the equation obtained by replacing
cm (nt+ u) by ita value as the sum of two exponential expressions. A method generally better
is to replace the equation by

by virtue of Cauchy’s theorem.
Now a residue maybe given a simple definition. Suppose

where $(z) does not vanish when x = a, i. e,, no factor z – a may be canceled out, the fraction is
in ib lowestterms. The function $(z) may be expanded by Taylor’s theorem about z = a as:
~(~) =+(a) ++ ’(a)(z–a) +*’’(a)

(z–a)’+

. . . . .

and

where A{= @J(a)/i ! with +(9(a) denoting the ith derivative of @(x) taken for the value r = u.
The coe%icient A _ which occurs over the factor z – a is called the “residue of ~(z) at z =a.”
In c~e n=l,

that is, if~(z)=~),

the residue of fat a is +(a).

In case n =2, that is, if j(x) =*,

the residue of j at a is #’(a).

As applied to the case in hand where

the function for the consideration of the value x= –v – in may be written
f(h) -

by substituting h = - u—in in the numerator;

In the tit there is no residue for X= – .0654– .187i and the residue for k= – .0654 +.lS7i is
negligible compared with that of the second expression for k= – .0654+ .lS7i (which is the easy
one to calculate). As the residues at h= – 4.18 + 2.43i refer to the short oscillation, they
need not-be oaloulated, and therefore the only calculations really neceesary for discussing
the path are those for the residues of the seocmd expression. The work was carried through

The values for -z/J are, for t=10, 12, 14, respectively, about 1.4, 1.9, 2.0; and from then
on the vahm decrwwe. Compare this for – z/J in the case of the periodic gust ~ = J sin .2t,
where the corresponding values are 1.9, 2.6, 3.0. It is seen that the damped periodic gust is
decidedly less tiectiva than the undamped gust. This is precisely what I foresaw, and indeed
what must be admitted a priori unless ~tonishing powera of discrimination are given to the
machine. A gust J=m~ sin .187t or J sin .2t does not difEer in general character from
the gust of the form J(I – .rs) or J(l – .r”’t) during the first rise from zero to a maximum—the plot of the intensity is nearly a straight line until the -imum
is approached and
the slopes of the lines are nearly equal. The machine is by its inertia an integrating, rather
than a differentiating device, and should give similar displacements in dl four cmes. The
damping in the fit case ttmds merely to diminish the effect. The maximum rise in the third
and fourth types is about – 3.5J, in the second case about – 3J (as is natural since the third and
fourth gusts persist where the second begins to decrease after about 8 s~onds), and the damped
gust gives –2J (as is again natural, since the maximum of that gust is only about .6J owing to the
damping factor). The successive forced oscillations in the csse of the damped gust drop off
wry rapidly, whereas the straight periodic gust brings a decided resonsnce into play after the
natural motion subsidm. The conclusion is thst the constants of integration are such as to
mask the effect of the damped gust in the first quarter period, whereas the damping makes the
effect small at the subsequent times of maxima.
