TECHNICAL NOTE NO'. 65.
LANGLEY FIELD WIND TUNNEL APPARATUS.

A Wire Suspension Aerodynamic Balance Especially De·s igned for Routine Tests of .Aerofoils at High Air Speeds.
The difficulties experienced in properly holding thin
tipped or tapered aerofoils while testing on an N.P.L. type
aerodynamic balance even at low air speeds t and the impossibility of holding even solid metal models, at the high speeds
attainable with the National Advisory Committee's wind tunnel,
necessitated the design of a balance which would hold model
aerofoils of any thickness and at speeds up to 150 m.p.h.
In addition to mechanical strength and rigidity it was
highly desirable that the balance readings should require a
minimum amount of correction and mathematical manipulation in
order to obtain the lift and drag coefficients and the center
of pressure.
The general scheme of the balance herein described is similar to that which has for some years been in use at the Univern

si ty of Gottingen, the main difference lying in · .the addi ti on of
a device for reading the center of pressure directly, without
the necessity of any calculation whatsoever.

A sohematic diagram of the balance is shown in Fig . 1.
The wing A is hung upside down from the dir.ect reading balance
B by means of four wires attached to a frame which will be described later.

These four wires hang perpendicular to the air

stream and thus carry the lift force on the model.

In like

manner wi re s m and n lying in a horizont aJ. plane th-rough1; :Che
axis of the tunnel carry the drag force to the common point 0
where they connect with the

~ertical

wire d and the two wires

fastened at their lower ends to the tunnel floor.

It is obv.i-

that the vertical
N along the axis

of the tunnel and is measured by a simple weighing

be~

fas-

. tened to a bench directly above the center of the tunnel.
The counterweight W is used for t wo purposes, viz, to prevent the wing from rising at angles of negative lift, and to
maintain an initial tension in the complete wire system .

It is

nOrmally carried slightly downstream by a pulley in order to produce initial drag but is allowed to hang directly dov
mward when
the center of pressure .1 s being measured.
The details of the mechanism used for adjusting the angle
of attack and for locating the center of pressure are shown in
Fig. 2.

The four lift wires hang from the aluminum frame

ABeD

which is hinged at C and D to the horizontal frame EFGH relative to which it may be angularly adjusted by a geared sector
and a pinion to whioh is fastened an index plate at E, fitted

- 3 -

with a spring dowel which automa.tically locks the frame ABCD
at the exact angle desired.

As the lift wires, the wing chord

and this frame form a vertical parallelog ram it will be seen
that the chord line will alway s remain parallel to the frame
ABCD and that the angle between AD and EH may be taken as the

angle of attack.

A slight error is introduced by the uneven

stretching of the lift wires when loaded, but this is usually
negligible.
The method used to obtain a direct reading of the center of
pressure is best explained by reference to Fig. 3.

The center

of pressure, defined as the intersection of the resultant Rand
the wing chord is shown at P and the resolved forces by Land D
respectively.

The line of action of L intersects an imaginary

wing chord at pI and divides it in the same r atio as the actual
wing chord.

By finding a point such as pll where the frame EFGH

may be supported in equilibrium by a pair of sliding knife edges
the center of pressure of the wing may be read directly from a
suitable soale.

The drag force D acting at a distance QA from

the 'line of action of the drag wire introduces an arror in this
reading of
D tan a x AP

L

AB .

which for a normal wing reaches a maximum value of ab,o ut 1% of
the chOrd at an angle of attack of 160 and w h may t herefore

be neglected.

In order to eliminate the effect of the centers

of gravity of the various masses a series of counterwei ghts

(Fig . Z) has been provided which bring these centars of gravity to lie on the axis CD, No.1 being conne cted with fr arr.e

bearing on the balance pl atform and support the entire moving
mass in a stat e of n eutral equilibrium when no air is pas s ing
through the tunnel .

The knife edges K K slide on ways and

while testing can be lifted by a cam against EFGH at any position along the im~ginary cho r d for a trial balance.

The knife

edges are then moved forward or backward until " equilibrium is
reached.

The center of p ressure thus obtained is read direct-

ly in percent of the chord with an accuracy of about 1 percent
exoept in the nei 6 hborhood of zero lift, when it becomes indeterminate .
The model wing is fastened by countarsunk nuts to studs
projecting from two steel skids attached to the wire system) as
shown in Fig . 4.

The zero angle is set by means of a spirit-

l evel, and the turn-buckles in the wires.
This balance has given sati sf action in servi ce, holding all
types of wings at speeds up to 120 miles per hour, and proving
convenient and labor saving during routine tests.

The large

drag correction for the wires prevents great accuracy of drag
measurements with small models but the relative magnitude of
this correction decreases as the size of the model increas e s .
