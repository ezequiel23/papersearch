The following is a description of a tilti ng manometer
designe d by the technical staff of the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics to mee t the requir e ments of a
manometer for use in the Wind Tunne l of the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory.
T· ... . 8 gauge wa s designe d to me et the requir eme nts of a
manollieter for use in connection with a static pressure
plate, to indic ate the wi nd spee d in the tunnel.
requirements are:

These

first, that the sensitivity of the

gauge may b e made inversely proportional to the pressure
to b e measuredj second, that the gauge may be accurately
and quic kly set for any desired pressure; and third,
that When set at the desired pressure the extent of variation between th e existing and the de sired pressures
may be readily estimated.

As the pressure measured be-

tween the statiC plate in the tunnel wall, and the air
