For specimens of this shape the electric furnace shown in figure 3 was used, and temperatures were indicated by a single thermocouple
placed in an iron plug which supported the

For reducing the results of either type of specimen from the observed resistance to a basis
of the resistivity of the material the factors connecting these two quantities were computmd
from the dimensions of the specimens.

the specimen, and R2 and RI arc+,respectively, the external and internal radii of the insulator.
In most of the work the resistances were measured by reading a voltmeter connocted
across the specimen and an ammeter in seri& with it ancl taking the quotient of these values as
the resistance.
As will be seen from the following, a wide variety of sources was used to provide
the applied voltage, and the indicating instruments were correspondingly
varied in character.

from a step-up transformer.
The connections used to obtain this rectification and to reduce the
fluctuations in the resulting continuous voltage are shown in figure 4. This rather complicated
system was chosen in an attempt to duplicate to some extent the voltages existing in ignition
systems, a.ncl, although this source of voltage was later abandoned, the data obtained with it
brought out the salient facts in regard to this type of conduction.
The most striking of these
facts, as verified by other measurements made later, is the very rapid clocrease in resistance of

The magnitude of this heating effect is exemplified by the behavior of u porcelain sample

The fundamental manifestation
of this so-called, polarization is that if a const+mt (iircct..

to an increase in resistance by a factor of 10 or 20. If the specimen is allowed to remain at a

The apparent permanent increase of resistance observed with this specimen serves to explain
some mysterious results obtained at an earlier date, in which one specimen had shown an
increase of resistance to more than twenty tim.e$ its initial value after several successive tests.
The fact that an appreciable time is required to obtain a reading, even with quick acting direct
current indicating instruments,
and that during this time the specimen is being polarized, is
probably a complete explanation of the variation of apparent resistance with applied voltage,

DISCUSSION OF METHODS FOR MEASURINGRESISTANCES.
As a result of the data obtained in the preliminmy experiments just cl~scribcd, it, was
decided to adopt as the most satisfactory methocl for the rapid comparison of diflereut. types
of immlating materials the volt-ameter method, using alternating current.
under these condit ions the observed resistance is substantially
independent of the frequency, -roltageJ and t inm
of application, and the convenient values of 60 cycles and 500 voltti were adopted for the later
work. PlcJt 6 shows typical results obtained by this method and indicates the ngrecmcnk
It should be ~cmembcredj howcvor,
attainable on successive runs even at different volttiges.
that the results thus obtained are for the nmterial in the unpolarized state, tind, when in M-tual
use in ignition system, the material may show a much higher rwis tancc to the unidirectional
impulse from the magneto.
Of other possible methods for such work, a bridge method using direct current would be
objectionable because of the variable amount of polarization which woukl occur. .4t.tempts
were made to use alterrm ting current as a source, but the mcasul ements are domplicnt.ecl by the
effect of stray capacities shunting the high resistances which are necessary, and the tinw
required to obtain a balance on the bridge is a serious drawback because of the rnpid chungc
in the rwistances to be measured with even shght drifts of temperature.
The megger, while extremely rapid and convenient, is open to the dkadvantagw
of polmization and to the fact that the voltage supplied varies very considerably with the resis ttmre of
the specimen under test.
The use of a magneto in place of alternating current as a source has the great. adn-mtage
that it approximately
duplicates the conditions of operation in the engine. The magneto,
however,.ie very variable in its ouput, both from iktimt to instant tind as a result of permanent
change in the
changes m the magnets, contact points, etc. kforeover, there is an fibI’U?J~
operation of the machine when the resist a,nce of the specimen becomes so low as to cause the
spark in the safet:y gap to cease, and also the total variation of the current deli-rered with various
resistances in the circuit is comparatively slight with this type of machine.
A method involving the measurement
of the rate of 10SS of charge from a condenser
connected in parallel with the specimen has been used by Cunningham.
This method imitates
the Conditiom of operation much more closely than does tl]c ahernating current nletho~I, but

The principal objections are the very

These figures show a wide variation in the resistance of the different materia.ls but a rather
surprising similarity in the constant 6, which is a measure of the temperature coefficient of their
resistance.
It should be mentioned in this connection that while successive measurements
with alternating
current on a single specimen give results repeating to a few per cent, yet
measurements on different specimens of material which are supposed to be identical show wide
variations in resistivity, amounting in some cases to a factor of 10, This fact tends to indicate
that the conduction is due to a considerable extent to the presence of small amounts of
impurities which may vary greatly in amount without appreciably affecting the composition
of the material as a whole,
It appears from the above data that the alternating
current method developed is very
practical and convenient for comparative
measurements
on samples of this “character, but
there is a very wide field of investigation concerning the phenomenon of polarization and much,
interesting work may be done in developing theories as to the precise mechanism by which
conduction is carried on in this class of materials.

The most convenient basis of comparison for different materials is the “effective temperature” ( 2“) to which they must be heated in order to reduce their resistivity to a definite w.due. This
value is arbitrarily taken as one megohm per cm. cube. A spark plug of normal design with
material of this resistivity -would have a resistance of about 200,000 ohms. This value is only
slightly above the limit at which the usual ignition system can be counted on to fwe a plug. The

FOR AERONAUTICS.

The edy measurements of electrical concluctivity, which were made with direct current,
showed the existence of vercy complex phenommm, such as polmizat,ion, etc., and it was fmmd
necessary to develop an alternating-current
method for test ing the specimens.
The various
phenomena observed during the development of this method are cliscussecl in detail in I%rt 1
of this report, and in what follows only the method finally adoptccl and the rwdts obttiined by
it will be given.
METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.

.

The specimen of insulating materitil to be tested is heated in an electric furnace to the desired
temperate.
Sixty-cycle alternating current at 500 volts is impressed upon the specimen lwA voltmeter connected between these electrodes and an mmnetw
tween two suitable electrodes.
in series with the specimen are read simult aneously and tho quotient of eflecti~e v.jltage divided
by effective current is taken m the resistance.
Since the current through the specimen is rather smalI, a very sensitive milliammetw is required and in most of the work it is found most convenient. to use for this purpose a dynamometer
wattrneter.
The fixecl coil of this wattmeter is excited by a known current, from t.hc same source
The moving coil of the wtittmetor is conof supply as the test current through the specimen.
nected in series with the specimen.
Such an arrangement provides u higher sensitivity thtin cm
be attained with commercial milIiammetws, and is also convenient in the great range of currents
which can be measured by using various exciting cuments,
The connections used in this twt
are shown in figure 1.
Measurements made by this method on the same sample me found to give rw.ults agmwing
to a few per cent when different. voltages, frequencies, and times of application of the mewuring
current are used. This method has been adopted by the Bureau of Aircrtif t I?roduction nnd is
recommended in their specifictition No. 2S,0 17.
TWO types of test specimen have been used in this work.
l?or the accurate nwasurcmcnt
of the conductivity of the material, a cup specimen, similar to the American Society for Testing
Materials, standard test piece No. 1, is very convenient, though it is not essential that t.h~ side
walls of the cup be tapered.
Figure 2 gives a cross section of t-his type of specimen.
The test cup is filled to a depth of about 2 cm. (0.S inch) with melted solder, which forms one
electrode, and is in turn set in a slightly ltirger shallow steel cup containing melted solder, which
forms the other electrode.
This arrangement insures good contact between the elmtrodes and
the porcelain.
To avoicl cracking the cup it is, of course, neccsstiry to insert the solder in the
solid form and melt it by gradualIy increasing the fumuce temperature.
I?igure 3 shows tho
arrangement of the cup specimen in the furnace.
Two thermocouples protected by porcelain
tubes are inserted in the solder in the test specimen and in a hole in t,he steel cup, respectively.
Ideasurements of resistivity are made only when these two couples inrJkate substuntiully the
same temperature.
In cases where cup specimens are not available, actuaI spark plu~ insuIat ors are tested,
using the central electrode as one termimd and the shell of the spark plu~ M the other.
Jn cases
where the insulator is removed from the shell, a band about 2 cm. (().LR
inch) wide nt t-he cent m
of the length of the insulator was coated with platinum by painting it. with a solution of plat inic
chloride (PtCIJ in oil of cloves and then heating the deposit to reduce the chlori[le to mchdlic
platinum.
This platinum belt is used as the outer terminal, and makes good contact with the
insulator.
The specimen is then inserted, as shown in figure 4, in an electric furntice, in which
the temperature is indicated by a thermocouple placed in contact with tho shell of. tho plug.
Measurements obtained on these pIug specimens are accurate as indicating the resistw-m
of the specimen, but owing to the irregukw shape and the uucert ainty as to the mea of outer
eIectrode in actual contact with the porcelain they are not suitable for accurately measuring
the resistivity of the material.

of the plugs, which are given in Tables IV and V. In this computation it has bem assumed
that contact was made over the entire surface covered by the shell of the plug, and consequenti,y
the values of resistivity computed on this basis are too high if thk contact be imperfect.
It
should also be noted that the path for surface leakage is much shorter in the case of the plug

COMPUTATIONOF RESULTS.
The change of rmistivity with temperature
for the class of materials tested k so rapid
that it is impracticable to plot resistivity vs. temperature
directly, as a scale which is suitable
at one end of the temperature
range becomes extremely crowded at the other.
It has been
found, however, that by plotting the logarithm of the resistivity against the temperature

and the data can be represented within the range of temperatures used with sufficient accuracy
by a straight line ‘ which most nearly fits the observed points.
Plot 5 shows a typical curve
obtained on a cup specimen and also. shows the agreement to be expected on repeating the
observations on the same sample even at different voltages.
The points on the straight line give the relation

c and b depend upon the material only and not upon the shape or size of the particular specimen,
and from a knowledge of these constants p can be computed for any temperature
by equation (2). Unfortunately
neither c nor t is very convenient as a figure of merit for the material,
‘“since a slight error in either will greatly affect the value of the other,
We have, therefore,
found it advantageous to compute for each material p 5,,, which is the resistivity of the material
at 5000 C. bother
still more convenient figure of merit is the temperature at which the material
has the definite resistivity of one rnegohm per centimeter cube.
This can be computed by the equation.

T,=?
This value is given in the following tables for each material, and is the most satisfactory criterion
of its value as an insulator at high temperatures.
A physical interpretation
of the’ fact that the results when plotted logarithmically
give a
straight line can be obtained by considering that the conductivity increases with temperature,
according to the law of compo.ynd interest, at a rate of about 2 per cent (2.3V) per degree
Centigrade.
The cumulative effect of the compounding is such that an increase@ temperature
of 100° corresponds in the average material to an increase in the conductivity of 600 per cent.
1A slight error is theoretically introduced by this method of repraseutib.rg the results, since the poorer materials are tested
peratures, where the curve is steeper. This is entirely negligible for the purposes for which the results are to be used.

tunately, the variation in Te obscrvecl in different specimens of what was supposed to be the
same materitil sometimes amounts to as much as JO* C, and this mwiaticm should bu borne in
mind in comparing the results on different materials.
It should also be noted that where both cup and plug samples of non~inally the sumc mutuThree explanations for
rial were tested the latter usually showed decidedly lower resistance.
this may be suggested:
First. The material is made up by a somewhat different process, the cup specimens being
mokled under slight pressure while the pIugs are extruded through a die.
Second. Ehmface leakage and conduction through the glaze may have been present in the
plug specimens and not in the cups.
Third. The cup specimens being especially prepared for test, nmy have been made up with
greater care than the plugs.
CONCLUSIONS.
The following conclusions seem evident from the data giwm in the tddes.

PREPARATION

AND COi%lPOSITION OF CERANIIC BODIES FOR SPARK PLUG
INSULATORS.’
By A. V. BLEININGER.

R~SUM~.
In airplane engines the porcelain of the spark plugs is subjected to severe conditions,
involving high temperatures,
sudden heating and cooling effects, and mechanical stresses.
To be perfectly suited for the purpose, the material must remain a good electrical insulator at
the yaximqm
temperature
reached, should not be subject to permanent
volume chaiges,
shoulcl possess coqstant thermal expansion, a?ld must be strong and tough.
Porcelains possessing such qualities have been developed in the Pittsburgh laboratory of
the Bureau of Standards.
The compositions of the best types me as follows:

REPLACEMENT OF FELDSPAR.
tTpon comparing the T,values of the diflerent porcelains it was noted that there exists
no definite relation between the composition and the electrical conductivity.
On the other
hand, the higher the maturing temperatures of the porcelains, the higher was the T, due.
This is practically equivalent to saying that, roughly speak~~, the electrical rcsistmce at
higher temperatures is the greater the lower the feldspar content, since small amounts of this
flux make it necessary to carry the porcelain to a higher burning temperature.

however, is not well defined, as maybe observed from the resuhs compiled in the fohving tuble:

It is qui e evident that the micro-structure
of the porcelains is an important factor in this
\
.conru.wtion, since it can not be. immaterial how m“uch kaolin or quartz has been dissolved by
the fused felds~ar and “how much sillimanite has been formed.
The evidence, however, was
considered sufficient to warrant the replacement of the feldspars by other fluxes, the oxides of
magnesium and beryllium being used for this purpose.
Owing to the evolution of carbon. diofide during the firing process from magnesite, and
the artificially prepared basic magnesium carbonate, and the very large shrinkage accompanying their use as a flux, it was decided to introduce the magnesia in the form of a calci.ne;
that is, a silicate mixture previously fired to a point close to vitrification.
The mixtures employed for this purpose correspond to the formula: MgO Al,O, 2Si0,; MgO AI,08 4Eii0,, and”
MgO Al,O, 6SiOz. Of these, the first and the second were most used in this work.

smaller kdns are to .be preferred to larger ones, since they require less time in cooling at a

REPLACEMENTOF QUARTZ.
From ageni$rai study of porcelains, it appears desirable to eliminate the qufit.z, as has been
pointed out in a previous paragraph.
Some of the materials available for this purpose are
calcined kaolin, synthetically prepared sillimanite (&O~ SiOz), and sinterccl or fused alumina
and zirconium oxide. These substances have been introduced in a number of compositions.
The effecti
adding calcined kaolin in general was beneficial; and even with a fcldspw contout

amount of white fused alumina available was not more than 2 pounds.
To bring about the
necessary impervious and dense structure the use of 17.6 per cent-f feldspar was required.
A
mixture consisting of 45 per cent kaolin, 17.6 per ceg-t feldspar, 4.4 pm cent calcine No. 13,
and 33 per cent of alundum, resulted in a very tough porcelain which showed a T~ value of 620.

again the reduction of the feldspar content and its replacement by calcino INo. 13, or beryl, or
a combination of these two would be certain to raise the T~value considerably ml at the snme
time would result in a porcelain of excellent mechanical properties. The cost of tho fused
white alumina would be quite high, but would be justi.tkd under tho circumstances. - Furthermore, a single calcine could be readily produced by combining the raw materials of calcinc
No. 13, the kaolin and magnesite, with uncalcined ahunina from any corrvcnient source, and
firing the mixture to a point of constant volume, which_ could be accomplished at ~emperaturm
not exceeding cone .Nn. 18. At the same time this procedure. would simplify the process of
preparation very considerably.
Sillimanite (AlzO&iOJ is a normal component of all hard fired porcelain; and this constituent, if not present in the form of. large crystals, imparts to the mat trial const tincy in

and to introduce it in the porcelain composition in place of the
quartz.
This was done by combining 7Q.20 per cent=of pl@ic kaolin, 27.80 of anbydrous
alumina, and 2 per cent of boric acid. After grinding this mixture in the dry state in a ball mill,
it was made up with watxw to form a plastic mass which was molded into balls calcincd to u
temperature corresponding to that of cone No. 20, or appro~imately
1,530° C. At this teKnperature the mass sintered to a dense structure,
subject to but little additional shrinkage

The boric acid was addctl to
assist-in bringing about the necessary shrinkage and closing up of the pores, rmd it is quite
probable that most of this constituent is volatilized at the iinal temperature of the calcinntion.
This calcine (hTo. 19) was then crushed separately, passed over a magnetic separator, and then
ground, together with the other materials of the b6dy with the addition of water} in the ball mill.
In preparing this type of body the feldspar was eliminated on the basis of the results cliscusscti
above, and replaced by a calcine corresponding
to the formula lfgo AIZO* 4SiOZ (No. 14).
This porcelain (No. 152) was composed of 30 per cent of kaolin, 10 per cent of ball clay, 40 per
cent of sillimanite calcine, and 20 per cent of fluxing calcine No. 14, and fired to a twnpcra turc
of cone hTo. 16 or higher.
The resultant material had excellent mechanical qualit ics and an
average Te value of 690. The structure of this body should be fine and dense, a condition
which requires quite rapid cooling of the kiln. Slower coding results in the fmwmtion of conrser
sillimanite crystals which cause a structure much less resistant to sudden heating and cooling.

Attention might be called to the fact that the use of a siliceous porcelain is not objectionable
from the electrical standpoint but only from consideration of the mechanical strength, resistance to sudden temperature changes, etc. This is shown by. the results upon high silica porcelains, bodies Nos. 116 and 119, which show a very high T, value, namely 730. This type of porcelain contains 50 per cent of clay, 30 per cent of free quartz (flint), and 20 per cent of magnesia

In No. 116, the calcine- corresponds to the formula MgO AlzO, 2Si0,, and in No. 119

Owing to the fact that these zircon porcelains were produced comparatively
early in the work, feldspar was employed as the flux. The result was that the electrical resistance, and hence the T~ value, was low, being 500 and 450, respectively.
With the use of the magnesia or beryllium fluxes much bettex products could undoubtedly be produced.
The mecharv

It is at once evident from a comparison of these figures that the thermal expansion of these
magnesia porcelains incremes with the silica content of the body, and, at the same time, is
subject to decided variation within the temperature
limits of 30°-5500 C. On the other hand
the porcelain in which the clay content is lower, and all the quartz has been replaced by sil.limanite, shows both the lowest thermal expansion and the least variation in the value of the
coefficient.
However, the composition is not the only determining factor, and the importance
of the microstructure
must be realized.

CONCLUSIONS.
The work, the results of wh@h have been given, has been successful in showing: First, the
injurious qualities imparted to electrical porcelains by the. use.of feldspar as a flux; and second,
in bringing out the desirability of replacing the quartz by minerals or synthetically
prepared
materials which are more constant in volume when heated.
The remedial procedures advocated
are, hence: (1) The replacement
of feldspar by other fluxes, such as silicnt.cw of the type
MgO AI,O~ 2Si0,, or MgO AlaO~ 4S30Z, or other silicates of beryllium and the rdkalinc earths,
either natural or prepared artificially.
(2) The elimination of quartz and the substi~ution of
substances not subject- to inversions or other volume chan~s.
These may be highly cmlcined
kaolin, alumina, zircon, or sillimanite, ei~her natural or produced syntheticfly.
.
The compositions of the most typical porcelains produced in this -work me compihd in
Tables IV, V, and VI, and the 2’, value is given for eac~~body, so that these tabulations maybe
conwdted for detailed information.
All of the electrical measurements, &Swell as the d~t&minations .of the thermal cxpansiin of
the porcelains, have been made in the Washington laboratories of the Bureau of Standards.

Considerable trouble has been caused in airplane engine work through the breaking of the
central electrode of spark plugs,
An investigation of this problem by the Bureau of Standards shows that in many cases the
cement used to hold the nickel electrode wire in the porcelain is of such a nature that it rapidly
eats away the wire through oxidization, when exposed to the high temperature
of the engine
cylinder.
A cement composed of silicate of soda and raw kaolin has been found to give the least
trouble in this respect.
In cases where the cement holds the wire firmly in the porcelain the latter often cracks when
subjected to heat due to the difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the wire and
the porcelain.
The breaking of the porcelain does not seem to be due to leaky spark plugs as
has often been. supposed to be the case.
On account of the.difllmdties attending the use of any form of cement between the porcelain
and central electrode, the elimination of the cement and the-use of a mechanical seal at the top

withstand the resulting stresses should be used. The porcelain recently developed by the
Bureau of Standards is believed tb meet these requirements.

Considerable trouble has been experienced in the operation of airplane engines due to
breaking of the central electrode wires in spark plugs at the point where they enter the porcelain.
Examination of numerous broken spark plugs showed that at the point of failure the central
electrode wire was oxidized practically through its cross section, this oxidization extending up
into the spark plug a variable distance, depending upon the permeability
of the cement with

the wire to the insulator, must be investigated.

gave the most trouble, while another maker, -whose plugs are used in large quant iiies for airplane work, employed finely ground silica. Sihcate of soda cements are advantageous for this
work because they are cheap, can be worked cold, und are gas tight at low temperatures.

were broken off and the wire beneath them examined.
From Table 1, it appeals that the solids used do not act simply as inert material.
In the
second case in this table, for instance, the reaction probably is as follows:
Na10. Si02 + 13aS04,= Na,SO, +BaO. S10,.
The reactions in the other cases are too problematical to be worth discussion here. It is
sufficient tcnay that raw kaolin wfi.s found to be the best solid for use in spark plug cemente
since it absorbed the sodium silicate as fast as it melted and produced an impcrviouq mass.
The oxidation is greatly accelerated by contact with fused alkaline substances.
Attempts were made to seal the wires into the porcelain af ker heating by means of glasses
ranging in coeilicient of thermal expansion from that of the porcelain to that of the wire.
None of these attempts have so far been successful, for_in cooling, the glass pulled away either
from the porcelain or from the wire. Special wire, with a coefficient of thermal cspaixsion
about equal to that of porcelain, has been ordered.
These experiments will then be repeated.
As a part of this investigation,
a visit was made by a representative
of the bureau to a
spark plug factory where all porcelains were subjected .to a sudden heating test, in which tho
tip of the porcelain was placed in the flame of a Meker burner.
_The porcelains were uniforndy
passing this “test. When it was suggested that p&cektina containing electrodes be tested in
the same manner, it was fonnd that 45 per cent of the porcelains cracked.
A the result of
actual engine tests of. complete plugs at the bureau, it has been found in general that in the
cracked plugs the cement is holdi~~ well, the fai.lure being due to the difference in coefllcient of
thermal expansion betiveen the porcelain and nickel wire, which sets up so h~gh a stress between
the two parta of the plug that one or the other has to give way. This conclusion is confirmed
by the fact that in the above factory tests, on the 55 per cent-of plugs that did not fail, either
cement was absent from around the wire near the tip of the porcelain or else it softened and
gushed out of the hole.

The subject of gas leakage of spark plugs in relation to failure of the central electrode has
also been studied.
While considerable work has beefi done in determining the gas leakage of
new plugs in view of the above results, it appeared advisable to determine leakage on plugs
that had been used in an airplane engine.
In Table 2 are giveri the results of examination of a
typical lot of 40 plugs. The following information will be of assistance ti reading this table,
Of the 12 broken plugs, 6 leaked badly- and 6 did not leak at all. Of those that leaked badly,
4 contained loose wires and, in the case of one of these, the wire could b.e pulled out easily.
It i~ evident that tests for gas leakage on new plugs give no indication of their gas leakage in use
and that this leakage does not necessarily produce broken porcelains.
In conclusion it may be stated that on accoullt of the dficulties inciclent to the use of cement
between the electrode wires and porcelains in spark plugs, the elimination of the cement entirely
and the use of a mechanical seal at. the top of the porcelain is greatly to be desired.
The
rnechunical stress incident to the use of such seals should be lotialized at. the top of the plug.
The type of porcelain developed by thb bureau has sufficient strength to withst and the necessary
stresses.
At least two manufacturers
of spark plugs are fo~owiqg up the suggestions of the
bureau along thk line and tests of these plugs are to be carried out as soon as samples are received:
