Q

FLEXIBILITY OF BEARING SURFACES AND STRESS ON FABRICS.*
By
A. Pxoll.
Ezperience ha~roved

that the strength of airplane win~s

is in no slight degre& dependent on the,tension due to the cowering of &e

bearing surfaces, which counteracts the deflection

l
of the spars and ribs. This .infuence is particularly noticesble in the so-called ‘C loading,’.
which occurs when an airplane
makes an almost perpendicular nose-dive. The air forces on the
wings axe then jiincipal.lyreduced to the frontal resistanm and
to a couple in a plane perpendicular to .the bearing surfaces,
which causes strong torsion.of the wings, so that one spar is
deflected upwards and the other downwards.

It may therefore.
be

expected that there is great stress on the fabric in such cases.
@

account of the direct air forces, however, the load?.s exi

tremely unsymmetrical.

der the simplified conditions of righting the airplane during
steep gliding flight (Case A) both stresse,s
may be added.

that not only is the capacity for resistance c~siderably higher
then in non-impregnated fabrics, but that the materi~ ~ above ~1>

It must be observed that ~ also changes in cdhsequence of
the deflection of the RIBS, also on aco unt of the alteration of

tremely complicated ratio between

Sl, Sa and c~

the simplifications that have been attained, illwill be found
preferable to calculate with successive approximations and to insert MT = M

in the first place.

This will now be proved by c.omplet the example previousin~

If the cross-section of the spar has a moment of in-

J = 100 cm.4, and E = 105 kg.cm.2, the greatest moment

would be

& = 153 kg.ti. i’ = 0.2$.

The warp threads are arranged in direction I (parallel to the
spars) in this example.
The stress on the fabric is considerably increased through
the deflection of the spars, especially in direction 1.
The above cal.cula.tim
may be corrected by taking the vslue
S1 =

283 kg.m.

instead of the assumed value

S1 = 250 kg.m.,

though there would be but little difference in the result (Sl would
be somewhat“
less) and the value of A on the other hand, cannot be
so precisely estimated that the calculation would thereby be made
more accurate.
The fact that the tension predominates so strongly in the direction parallel to the spars is partly due to the fact of the
peculiarity of the characteristic standard curves, and particularly to the extensibility in the direction of the woof.
If, on the ,
contrary, the fabric were STRETCHED AT AN ANGLE
DIFFERING BY %3° (woof - spar, warp - ribs), the standard characteristic according. Fig. 6* is obtained, and an entirely simito
lar rendering of the calculation again leads to a curve

* All the indexes .1 and 2 must natur~y be altered in this case,
In the secmd standard characteristic for this instance, the downward (cent
raction) curves SI = constant are now curved lines;
this corresponds to the dissimilar s~acing between the extension
risti~.(Fig.
curves Sz = constant, in the first standard characte
3). SI (tension in the direction parallel to the ribs) is now
warp, while the woof direction is laid parallel with.the spars
and undergoes tension S2.

,.

The same temporary supposition that

Sz = 250 kg-m-

was es-

tablished in this case with regard to the “tensioncaused by the
flexion of the fabric. As it proves to be far too large in this
case, a corrective calculation must be made.

Sz = 170 kg.m.,
and C2’ =

0.0041,

Assuming that

& e h= 510 kg.cm. in that qase, M = 9000 kg-cm.,

alteration.
For the fabri~ utilized in this case, AN INTERCHANGE OF WOOF

‘

AND WARP WOULD NOT ONLY LEAD TO GREATER UNIFORMITY OF TENSION, BUT
ALSO TO A CONSIDERABLE DIMINUTION OF THE TENSION OF THE FABRIC.
This is due tb the fact that the fabric hasgreater extensibility
in the DIRECTION OF THE WOOF, and ii has been admitted that it is
advisable to LAY THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THERE IS THE GREATER ExtenSibility pARALLEL WITH THE SPARS.*
