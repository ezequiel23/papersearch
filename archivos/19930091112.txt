QUARTERS FOR COMMITTEE.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1919, the administrative offices of the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautic were located in the Air Service Building, Fourth treet
and Missouri Avenue W. , IVa hington, D. C. The technical work of the committee, conducted by or under the supervision of the variou ubcommittecs, wa carried on in various
laboratories and shops belonging to the Governm nt, including the Bureau of Standards and the
committee's own field station at Langley Field, Va., and aloin various laboratories connected
with institutions of learning whose cooperation in the conduct of cientific research in aeronautic had been ecured.
THE FIELD STATION.

The committee's field station as a whole comprise a research laboratory, an aerodynamical
laboratory, and an engine dynamometer laboratory, aU of which buildings have beon erected
by the committee on a tract at Langley Field, Va. known as plot 16, which was set aside for the
committee's u e by the Chief ignal Officer of the Army in 1916. Its use by the committee was
officially approved by the A ting Secretary of VIaI' on April 24, 19] 9.
Langley Field was seleete 1 as the site for the conduct of the committee's re earch work
at a time when it was the intention of the Army and avy authorities to concentrate all research
and experimental work in aeronautic at Langley Field. The Navy sub equently secured a
site of its own on the other side of Chesapeake Bay, but the Army and the committee proceeded
with their original plans for the use of Langley Field. Owing to war pre ure, however, the
exp rimental work of the Army was early moved to McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, and Langley
Field wa used primarily during the war a a training school for aviators.
The Army intends to continue its experimental work at Dayton, and to use Langley Field
a a training and coast defense station and for experimental development work on airship .
Added to these circum tances are other considerations, of minor importance when taken

careful deliberation, that Congress authorize the removal of its activities from Langley Field,
Va., to Bolling Field, D. C. The committee belives it uneconomical and unsatisfactory to
remain at Langley Field. The same work can be carried on more efficiently, more promptly,
and more economically at Bolling Field, where the work can be more closely watched by all
members of the committee, and where the members of ·the engineering staff in charge of work
can have ready access to the committee, to large libraries and other sources of information,
constant communication with the Bureau of tandards, a more satisfactory marke-t for labor
and supplies and adequate power supply, and relief from the perplexing question of securing
quarters at Langley Field or in Hampton or other near-by towns. Much direct effort is wasted
in striving to accomplish results in the face of the difficulties encountered at Langley Field
The Army's plans for the development of Langley Field as a coast defense station will require
its use of the entire field and its facilities. The Army Air Service and the aval Air Service
are in accord with the committee in strongly recommending that Congress authorize the removal
of the committee's research activities and the equipment used in connection therewith to Bolling
Field, the disposal of the committee's buildings at Langley Field to the Air Service of the Army,
and the erection of the necessary permanent buildings at Bolling Field. There is. an immense
advantage to be gained from the conduct of scientific work in a center of education and learning,
and where it would be possible to confer with visiting scientists. Work conducted at Bolling
Field would also have the advantage of being accessible to Members of Congress.
THE RESEARCH LABORATORY.

The research laboratory at Langley Field, Va., is the headquarters of the committee's
field station. It is a permanent brick building, contaiping small, well-equipped woodworking
and machine shops, photographic and instrument laboratories, and bffices of the clerical and
drafting force of the field tation. The principal work of the research laboratory as a unit is
to serve the needs of the aerodynamical laboratory and the engine dynamometer laboratory,
in which the actual tests and experimental work are conducted.
THE AERODYNAMICAL LABORATORY.

In addition to the facilities for instrument, machine, and photographic work housed in the
research laboratory building, the· aerodynamical laboratory consists of a 5-foot wind tunnel
located in a specially con tructed permanent wind tunnel building. The wind tunnel has been
completed but is not yet in operation, due to lack of power. The Army's power plant at Langley
Field has not been completed, and no work is being done on same, due to lack of funds. The
power company of the city of Hampton is unable to furni h the necessary power. The committee proposes to install a 200 to 300 hor epower electric dynamometer to furnish direct current temporarily. This dynamometer will be operated by a Liberty engine, and will be converted to its proper laboratory work as soon as other means of securing power can be obtained.
Reference to the work of the aerodynamical laboratory, which includes the testing of the performance of airplanes in full flight, is made in another part of this report under the "Report of
the Committee on Aerodynamics."
THE ENGINE DYNAMOMETER LABORATORY.

The engine dynamometer laboratory is at present temporarily housed in a four-section
steel airplane hangar, erected during the past year. The major items of the present equipment
consists of one 300 to 400 horsepower electric dynamometer, one 40 to 75 horsepower electric
dynamometer, and one 2~ hoI' epower bench electric dynamometer. The two larger machines
are completely equipped with auxiliary apparatus sufficient to obtain all the data necessary for
standard tests, as well as that necessary in connection with the special investigations now in
progress or contemplated in the immediate future. Operation of this equipment has been
prevented by lack of power, but it i expected that this difficulty will shortly be overcome in
the manner mentioned in the description of the aerodynamical laboratory. Samples of domestic
and foreign aircraft engines have been assembled at the engine dynamometer laborator y for

OFFICE OF AERONAUTICAL INTELLIGE CEo

The Office of Aeronautical Intelligence has continued its work of collecting, analyzing,
cla sifying, and eli seminating scientific reports and technical data on aeronautical subjects.
The work is conducted under the personal upervision of Dr. Joseph . Ames, member of the
committee. acting also as Director of the Office of Aeronautical Intelligence.
'rhe general policy of the office i not only to make available to all who arc properly interested the re ult of recent development in aeronautic, scientific reports, and technical data
secured from many sources, but also to bring such material to their attention in an appropriate
manner.
The diiIerent reports received from outside sources during the pas t year numbered approximately 2,300. Many of these "Were copied in the office for distribution, other were filed for
reference only, and the remainder , because they were too large to copy, were circulated on loan.
The records of the office show that copies of technical reports were distributed among various

The Paris office of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was opened in June,
1919, for the purpose of securing by exchange scientific reports and technical data in European
countries, particularly England, France, and Italy, and its administration was placed under
the Office of Aeronautical Intelligence.
THE PARIS OFFICE.

On May 20, 1919, the committee authorized the establishment of a foreign office with
headquarters in Pari , to be under the general supervision of the Committee on Publications
and Intelligence and under the immediate supervision of a technical assistant in Europe. Arrangements were made with the State Department to have the technical assis tant in Europe
to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics accredited officially to the Governments
of Great Britain, France, and Italy.
The Pari office of the committee wa opened in Jun e, 1919, with Mr. William Knight, M. E.,
in charge. The general fun ctions of the Paris office are to collect and exchange reports, data,
and mi cellaneou information of a purely technical and scientific nature relating to aeronautics;
to translate t,his information, and to prepare ab tracts of important articles relating to aeronauti appearing in European scientific publications. The technical report and information
collected by the Pari office are transmitted to the Office of Aeronautical Intelligence for distribution in this country.
It is al 0 a function of the technical assistant in charge of the Paris office to secure special
information for American military and naval attaches or for special air service representatives
on request; to keep in close touch with the scientific research in progress, particularly at the t.
Cyr Aerodynamic Laboratory, in France, the National Phy ical Laboratory, in England, and the
Instituto Centrale Aeronautico, in Italy, and visit Italy and England once or twice a year .to
gather the latest information.

nder date of December 1 ,191 , the committee reported to the Presicient tbat the exp cted
development of conunercial aviation would make it exceedingl. de irable that certain fundamental principles be agreed upon at the peace conference ill relation to international air navigation and at that time ugge ted certain principlE's for con ideration.
In March, 1919, the committee recel,ed through the taLc Department a copy of proposed
regulations for international air navigation prepared by the Inter-Ministerial ommi sion of
ivil Aeronautics appointed by the peace conference at Pari. The committee at that time
wa not a ked to comment on the term of the document. It did however report to the Pre ident that certain minor change in the u e of technical term \\-ere ael,i able anel submitted a
revised draft of the convention to the Pre ident for his u e at the peace conference.
Under elate of August 9, 1919, the ecretary of tate officially ubmitted to the committee a copy of the propo ed convention for the regulation for international ail' navigation
prepared by the Inter-lI1ini terial Commi ion of Civil Aeronautic and requested that the
ational Advisory Conunittee for Aeronautics give thi proposed convention it early consideration and furnish him any comment or ugge tion or taiement of view it may feel
called upon to make, adding that Lhe convention wa at that time the ubject of conferences
between repre elltatives of the variou pm"el' at Pari. lIe stated furthermore that the

proposed cOllvention: War, Jayy , Tl'ea ury, and Po t Office Department., eological ur,ey,
and P atent Office.
A special meeting of the executive committee of the ational Advi ory Committee for
Aeronautics was accordingly helel on Augu t 14, 1919, at which a special ubcommittee on
international air navigation wa apr ointed consisting of representati,e of tbe Weather
Bureau, the Army and Navy Air eryice, the Post Office Depart.ment, the Cu tom erVlce;
the Geological urvey, the Commi ioner of Patent, the Manufacturer .Ajr raft A ociation,
and the National Advisory Committ e for Aeronautics. The function of thi ubcommittee
were defined as follow :
First. To con ider the convention relating to international air navigation and the report
of the aeronautical commi ion tbereon rendered Lo the conference of peace .
Second. To discus 1.be contemplat d report to Lhe ecroiary of lale of the various

mercial air routes. Commercial aeronautics will be very low indeed to get started in the
United States in the absence of material encouragement and help from the Government. At
the present time there is no governmental agency duly authorized to expend funds in aiding
the development of commercial aviation.
Dr. W . F. Durand, a member of the Adyisory Committee, prepared a comprehen ive
statement of the need, the opportunity, and the difficultie of establi hing commercial aviation
in this country, which was issued by the committee in August, 1919.
AIRCRAFT STANDARDS.

The International Aircraft tandards Commission e tablished during the war adopte 1 a
program calling for the permanent participation of variou nations in such a commission with
a view to the establishment and maintenance of tandard terms amd practice for aeronautics.
In June, 1919, the committee recommended to Congress that it be authorized, along with other
Government departments, to advise in the election of repre entatives to attend such a conference abroad if American participation were approyed by Congress. In the ab ence of such
approval by Congress, the Committee on Aerodynamics of the ~ -ational Advi ory ommittee
for Aeronautics has undertaken the e tablishment of cerLain aeronautical tandard in thi
country with the cooperation of the military and naval air ervices, the Bureau of Standard,
and other Government agencies concerned.
NOMENCLATURE FOR AERONAUTI CS .

Dl,ITing the pa t year the committee has continu d i work on the standardization of
Engli h nomenclature for aeronautics. It is at pre ent engaaed in an extensive revi ion of
its last report on nomenclature (~- o. 25) published in the fourth annual report. It is propo ed
to make the nomenclatm'e more comprehensive, to iUu trate clefmitions where nece sary or
advi able, and to include aerodynamic ymbols. After agreement has been reached amon a
the various interested aaencies in America, the committee will undertake to secure uniformity
with Great Britain in the u e of technical terms and symbols.
BIBLIOGRAPHY OF AERONA TICS.

Th committee has continued the bibliography of aeronautics during the past year. The
publication on thi ubject are printed and i ued ar art from the annual reports. The first
work on thi ubject wa prepared by Mr. Paul Brockett of the mith onian In titution and
included the period up to ] 9] o. The committee has prepared a bibliography of aeronauti s
from 1910 to 1916 in two volume, and a bibliography for the year ]917 and ]91 ha been
prepar d in one volun1.e. It i the pre ent policy of th committee to i u a current bibliography annually in the future.
AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY.

On 1I1arch 7, 1919, a pecial ubcommittee on Aerial Photographic Ul'yeying and Mapping
was appointed consi ting of Dr. Joseph . Arne , Dr. John R. Freeman, Dr. John F Hayford,
and Dr. CharI F. Marvin, to consider ways and mean of coor linating the activities and methods of the various governmental agencie intere ted in the application of aerial photography
to smv:eying and mapping. On in,itation of th Executive Committee, based on recommendation of thi pecial subcommittee, repre entative of the following goyernmental agencies met
with the ubcommittee on Aerial Photographic Ul'Yeying and Mapping on April 23,1919: '1'h
Air ervice of the Army; Corps of Engineers, United tate Army; :Kaval Air ervice; Geological urvey; Coast and Geodetic Survey; Post Office Department; Bmeau of Standards.
The Kational Advisory Committee for Aeronautic ugge ted that consideration be given
by the repre entatives of the variou aovernmental agencies intere ted to the phases of aerial
photography and mapping which the various agencies were be t qualified and equipped to handle,
in order that the work of each may be made to fit, where practicable, into that of the other, and

ARMY MEDICAL RESEARCH WORK ON AVIATORS.

In accordance with a War Department order in October, 1917, the following officers were
directed to report to the chief surgeon of the Aviation Section, Signal Corps, for a signment to
duty as members of the medical research board of the Air ervice: Maj. Johp B. Watson, Maj.
Wm. H. Wilmer, Maj. Edward G. Seibert, and Maj. Eugene R. Lewis. Dr. Yandell Henderson,
professor of ph ysiology at Yale University, was added to the board in civilian capacity and was
appoin ted chairman.
The powers delegate(l to the board were as follows:
1. This board shall have discretionary powers to investigate all conditions which affect the efficiency of pilots:
2. To institute and carry out at flying schools or elsewhere such experiments and tests as will determine the ability
of pilots to fly in high altitudes;
3. T o carry out experiments and tests at flying schools or elsewhere to provide suitable apparatus for the supply of
oxygen to pilots at high altitudes;
4. To act as a standing medical board for the instruction of all matters relating to the phy -ical fitness of pilots.

In accordance with this authority the board worked at first in association with the Bureau
of Mines, to whom a great deal of cr edit is due for assistance and ooperation in the carly days
of the war. The board later became independent.
In order to work out these problems the Modical Re earch Laboratory was established at
Mineola, N . Y. The laboratory was divided into the following departmenLs: Physiology,
cardiovascular, psychologJ, otology, ophthalmology, neurology and psychiatry. Later a
department of physics and engineering was adderl.
The immediate military problem of classification was preceded by certain nece sary research on which to establish the basis of such classification.
peciali. ts from all parts of the
country were called in to a sist in the work of the various departments.
pecial apparatus had
to b e constructed for a great deal of the work. In spite of this, it was not long before a rou tine
test for the classification of aviators wa developed, which will be described later, and research
on numerous other points was taken up. In order· to facilitate the classification of aviators,
twenty branch laboratories were plunned at the various flying schools and ground 'chool. The
personnel for their operation was trained at the centrallabOl~atory, an 1 ten of the branch labora. tories were in active operation before the armi tice was signed . When fiigh t surgeon were
needed they r eceived their training at the central laboratory, as did the physical directors of
the Air Service. A laboratory unit under the command of Col. William H. Wilmer was organized .from the personnel of the main laborator.y and went oversea for duty with the expeditionarJ forces. The research work ha continu ed, ince h armistice.
A brief outline of the work accomplished at the labora tor:- is as follows: Fir t of all the
phys iology of altitude wa carefull.v tudied. A great deal of work had been done with thi in
previous years on Monte Ro a in Europe, and Pike's Peak in the -enited States. Mo t of the
changes that result on mountains arc the r esult of residence at that altitude for a considerable
period of time. An aviator does not remain at high altitude any length of time, consequently
permanent adaption to physiological changes do not occur. The effects of aviation were
studied in actual flying, and by sinmlatiog aviation with the usc of a low pressure tank and a
rebreathing machine.
The low pressure tank consists of a steel tfmk controlled hy all cxhttU. t appflratlls by which
the atmospheric pressure and the oxyo-en can be reduced at. will, together with provision for
a fresh upply of air, so that any altitude may be simulated from sea level up to 36,000 feet.
A de. cription of the r ebreathin g machine is quoted from " The Au: Service ..1edical":
The base of the machine is a steel tank of 60 or 80 liters capacity, according to the type. Air is inspired from the
tauk through the pipe at the left, and is expired back into the tank through the pipe and absorbing cartridge at the

right. The valves keep the air stream flowing alll"ays in the proper direction. In ord I' to maintain the contained air
at approximately atmospheric pressure and to allo\\" for changes in volume, a wet spirometer, carefully counterbalanced,
is mounted on the tank and communicated freely \yith i ts interior through the yertical pipe. A stylus attached to the
counterweight records the movements of the spirometer upon the smok d drum of the kymograph. \Vater is admitte 1
to the tank throu.,.h a valve to repla e the volume of the used oxygen and also to flush out the tank after an experiment..
The water is drained away to the sewer by means of a valye. A yah'e affords a free opening to the atmosphere for
flushing the tank of the rebreathed air.

It was soon ho,vl1 that Lhe factor 01 atmo pheri pres ure wa of secondary importance.
By mean of this rebreathing apparatus the physiology oJ low o\:ygCI1 in aviation W~)S tudied.
C.ompari ons of the rebreathing te ts with tho lilu tion to t; the effect on the breathing
when under the action of progressive decrea e in oxygen; the eHoct of a deer'ea ino- oxyo-en
supply on the circulation; the effect of arterial, venous, and capillary pressure; the question
of the vasometer tone and endurance of low oxygen ; the effect on the pul e rate and the
haemoglobin; alveolar air pressures; carbon dioxide capacity of the blood; and the relative
value of the compensatory factors were studied. The effects of low oxygen on circulatory
physiology; the relation of the vasomotor control of the hear t ; nervous factors in vasomotor
control; the question of compensation; heart strain; the arrhythmias, and the effect on
valvular disease and athletic hearts were also studied. These point covered the phy iological
side.
The function of psych logy in respe t to th u.viator is to study his adaptability to the
work required of him. Physiology tell u how the body react to low oxygen, and it wa the
duty of the psychology department to determine how the mind act under low oxyo-en. The
psychological ratina of aviators for altitude limits; the development of an apparatus for a
standard test; the investigation of the p ychological qualification of the flier; and experiment
on p ychological reaction under low oxygen tension are some of the points taken up by the
psychology department.
As a result an apparatus was developed for the standard test. A description of this
apparatus is quoted from II The Air Service Medical:"
(a) The app:l.ratus mounted on the table forms three separate units: (1) A erie of 14 stimulus lamps (2 candle
power) arranged in two rows of seven each, with two similarly arranged rows of contact buttons, each surrounded by a washer; a green check lamp and a red error lamp, and a stylus with a hard-rubber handle
and metal tip. These parts of the unit are so wired decu'ically that when a stimulus lamp lights the corresponding contact button is "alive," and if touched with the metal tip of the stylus cau, e the check lamp
to light. IE the wa her surrounding any of the buttons i touched with the tylu at any time the error lamp
light. (2) Two ammeter mounted on a metal arm above the table top arc connectec:! in serie with two
rheostats, one on the upper ide of the table top at the edge nearer the re:tctor, the other und er ne:l.th at the
edge ne:1rer the p,ych logist, A change in the resistance made by the psychologist at his rheostat, causing a change
in the ammeter re1ding, may be c mpens:tted for by a cll:1nge in the re:l.ct' r's rhe tat, by which the original ammeter
reading may be l'e3t:Jred. (3) A small ele tric motor mounted 011 the upper side of the table top i connected in series
with a thi.rd rheo t:l.t und erne:1th the table, A 2-way lever switch m unted underne:tth the table at the edge next to
the p ychologist and a r cking pedal 2-way switch on the (Joor under the table are connected with the rheo tat by a
3-wire system, so tInt a p:trt of the resistance of the rhe stat nn be cut out (thus increasing the peed of the motor)
by either switch and apin cut in (tIm re toring the lower motor speed) by either switch,

The rebreathing examination i m ade following a general physical examination !
cnd the
taking of a careful medical hi tory. A de cription of the rebreathing examina tion is quoted
from II The Air Service Medical:"
'l'he evidence is sufficient that thi test is a perfectly reliable index of toleran e to low atmospheric pre Sll1'e, and
the low-pressw'e chamber ha been u ed not a a routine method of examination, but only as means of checking up
the results of the other test and for scientific purposes.
The rebreathing machine is so adju (,ed that the average run will be be(,ween 25 and 30 minutes. During the run
the subject does the p ychological work, as de cribed later, and i carefully observed by the p ychologist to determine the earliest effects on attention and motor coordination, a well as the time of appearance of more marked eITects
and of total breakdown.
Every three minutes the capacity of the ex(,ernal and intemal ocular muscle i rete ted dUTing the run. (This
ha since been eliminat d from the lest.) During the wh Ie test (,he pulse and blood pre ure, systolic and diastolic,
are measlll'ed every olle or two minute. The clinician keeps cIo e watch of the e figures and make frequent examinations of the heart. The respiration is recorded throughout the test on a kymograph.

THE AIR MAIL SERVICE.

On May 15, 191 , the Post Office Depar~ment inaugurated the Air Mail Transportation
ervice. It had previously sought and re eived the advice of the ational Adyi ory Committee
for Aeronautics a to route ,methods, typ of planes, etc. At the uo-ge tion of the Chief ignal
Officer of the Army the ervice was originally conducted by the War Department in connection
with its ",·ork of training aviator for the war which was then being prosecuted. The er ice
continued under military direction until Augu t 10, 1918, when it wa takcn oyer by the Po t
Office Department and operated by an entirely civilian organizaLion .
The only equipment available at the time of the establishment of the Air Mail ervice wa
a few J. N-4-ll and R-4 Army training plane with a capacity of 200 pounds of mail. With
the clo e of the war quite a number of D. ll.-4 planes werc made available to the Post Office
Department, which made it po ible to increase the mail load t.~ 400 pounds. These airplall ,
however, were designed wholly for ·war purpo cs and lacked the nece sary strength for daily
cross-country flying with its incidental forced landings. It ,ya nece sary to modify thi
equipment which re ulted in the development of an airplane bett.er adaptcd to t.he requirement. .
The e changes con i ted of a greatly strengthened landing gear, fuselage enforcement and
transposition of cock-pit and cargo compartments.
While the performance of the e airplanes a remodeled wa generally ati factory it was
nece ary for the Po LOffice Department to contract for the COll iruction of large multi-cngin ed
airplane in order to insure reliability in performance of mail chedule trips and to provide for
larger mail dispatche . Orders were placed for 14 airplane, 6 of the Martin bomber type, 4 of
the Thomas-Morse modified type, and 4 airplanes of 104-foot wing pan by the L. W. F. Engineering Co.
A recent development is the transformation of aD. ll.-4 airplane into a twin-engined airplane. Thi airplane i equipped with two 200-horsepower Liberty-sL'\: cngines, ha develop d
a speed of 103 miles per hour, will maintain horizontal flight with one engine, and will carry 00
poun d of mail.
The service has been keenly aliye to the important matter of fire protection and has equipped
ts airplanes with fireproof bulkhead and liquid extinguisher system with automati crash
relea e devi e. Improved :fire protection sy terns are being in Lalled in the larger airplanes
now under construction.
Complete radio telegraphic communication "ill hortly be in taned by the Air Mail ervice,
too-ether with triangulation stations, which will make pos ible a complete di patching ystem
whose main fun tion will be to locate airplane accurately at any momelli during flight. Di tant
control are also heing developed in order that the Department at Wa hington may get in direct
communieation with any pilot in flight by means of radio telephone. The mnplifiel'S dev loped
by the War and J avy Departments were made ayailable to the Air Mail eryice.
A tatem nt of the work of the .Air Mail cITice would be incomplete without reference to
the ervice performance in the air. Earlyadyice received by the Post Office Department w re
that there would be great difficulty in main taining a daily sched ule of maililigh ts, an d the opinion
was held that the ervice would be in terrupted during the win Lcr mon ths and perhaps at other
times when conditions might be considered unpropitiou. Howeyer, the rapid de elopment
of aviation generally has made it pos ib1e to stabli h a reliable service, a is shown by the following r ecord: During the la t fiscal year only 4.4 pCI' ('cnt of the cheduled trip were not attempted,
and out of a total of 13 ,3 10 mile po sible there were flown 12 ,255 mile, or a performance of
92.73 per cent. During the same peri0d there were only 37 forced landing, due to mechanical
trouble during flight.
It would eem, therefore, that the achievement of the ..t\jr Mail Servi e may be regard d
as a substantial contribution in the practical development of commercial aviation.

METEOROLOGYJ INj'AID OF AERONAUTICS.

As are ult of the appropriation of $100,000 granted by Congro son reeommendation of the

Bureau, led to tho inauguration in December of 191 of a regnlar system of forecasts of free
air conditions which were supplied daily to the ignal Corp, the Post Office Department, the
Director of the Air Sel'yice, and other who de ired them. In tho boginning the region covered
were principally the mail routes between Wa hington, Philadelphia, and New York, and later
on extended to the mail route between New York and Chicago. Special information was
furnished the Army as oeca, ions might require.
The appropriations for thi.s activity have been continued in the regular appropriations or
the Weather Bureau, and in more recent time have been upplemenU~d b~T som cooperative
repoI'Ls from ba, e tations maintained by the Navy at coa tal points. The foreca ting work
has been, moreover, more fully s.ystematized and extended, the area of the L nited tate being
divided into 1:3 forecast zones, for which foreea'3ts are supplied to the Director of the Air Service
for distribution to those localities where night is in progress .
A con iderable amount of free ail' data has been compiled, tabulated, and published in
the Supplements of the Monthly Weather Review, and several important articlc discu ing
average free air conditions have also been publishod in the :Jlonthl,Y Weather Review itself
to make this information more generally available to aeronautical and military interest.
In addition to the foregoing systematic work of the Bureau, special anangements of
cooperation with the Army and Navy have been made for the purpose of supplying the fullest
po sible meteorological information in connection; fil'::-\t, with the trans- Hlantic flight of the
naval airplanes; second, in connection with the visiL of the British dirigible, R-34; and, fmally,
in connection with the transcontinental reliability tests of the Arm." Air ervice.
It i beheved the service renderecl by the aerological and forecasting work of the bureau
in connection with aeronautics has been of ve ry great value and has elicited the cordial commendation of the Secretary of the avy. Plan arc under way for the considerable extension
of thi line of activit.\T, and the estimates of the W cather Burc!Lu contain an incl'ea ' e of $200,000,
'which, if secured, will permit of the establishment of a considerable nWllber of additional pilot
balloon and kite stations in the reo-ions of the far West.
With the passing of war conditions, moreoyer, balloon material beeomes available for socalled souLlding balloon ob ervations, which must be made in order to carry the ob, ervations
to higher portions of the atmosphere than can be reaehod b.Y either kites, pilot balloons, or
ail' craft of any character.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE 0

AERODYNAMICS.

The committee on aerodynamics i a consolidation, made in April , 1919, of the tlu'('e committees on aircraft de ign, navigation of aU'craft and aeronautic instruments,. and free flight
•
tests.
The committee on aerodynamics recommended that in th part of the work at Langley
Field within its domain the emphasis should be placed mainly 011(a) tudiC's, in the laboratorie , of propC'ller from the arrod},'namic point of \riow;
(b) tudies, in the laboratories, of the Do,," of air around pnrt of airpJan(' and airship,
separately or assembled, and of the forces brought to bear on thosr parts by the au';
(c) Free flight te ts on full-sized machines; and
(d) The development of instruments, equipment, and method for making such tudies
and tests.
This policy has b en followed during the year.
The ,,'ork at Langley Field under th('se foUl' h('ad , carried on und('l' tho general dirC'cLion
of Ed\\rarcl P. Warner, ha been largely one of developnwnt and drsign, although some rrsea1'ch
work C011111eLe in iL elf ha been carried on. The wind tUllnd hft heen unlkr con truction
throughout most of the year and i now nearing completion, and a llumhl'r of experiments
on model tunnel have been made to determine the hC' t form to adopt for the 5-foot t.unnel
now und er construction. The balance for this tunnel has al 0 been clesiO'llecl and con tructed
at Langley Field, and is ready for u e. As an acce sory to th d(' ign of the balance a throrc1.ical
investigation of the errors to which uch balances are ubject and the considerations goyerning
theu' design has been made, and is published as a technical appendL,( to this report. The
most important experim ntal work complete in itself has dealt with f1'C'C' flight tests, research('s
ha'V"ing been conducted throughout the summer on two airplane IW'ill hed by the Au' en-icc.
These researches baye dealt chieny with the determination of the lilt and drag coeifLcients
and with the balance of the airplanes, thus giying data for purpo e of compari on with those
obtained in model tests.

stre ses in the airplane have also been undertaken, and tw-o of them are published as appendi..~es
to this report.
The development of autographie recording instrument for free flight te ts has continu d
at the Bureau of Standards under the general diTection of John F. Hayford and Lyman J.
Briggs for the committee. Of the SL,( new instrument designed fl\T arc now omplete, namely,
e
the air-speed meter, the angle-of-attack meier, the recording tachometer, the torque meter,
and the thTu t meter. The first three named have pa seel through exten ive laboratory tests
and calibrations, and are suhstantially ready for usc in the air. The torque meier and thrust
meter must b ubjected to extensive laboratory te is and possihle mo lifications before thoy
will be ready for u e. The stable zenith instrument, to be used for recording continuously
the angle between the wing ehord and the horizontal, ha been redesigned as a re ult of coniderable experience with this type of instrument. The redesigned instrument is being built
and is nearly complete.
Sp cial investigations have been macle and are still in proo-ress at the BUTeau of Standards,
under the recommendation of the committee, on the Parker variable camber wing for airplanes.
This is a promising line of attack of the problom of reducing the landing speeds of an airplane
without reducing 5ts flying peed. Inci(lentally some valuable information is bC'ing secured
in reo-ard 1,0 the po sibi1ity of usino- a tn'unuine wing and the ordinary type in a hiplane combination.
Researches on airplane propellers are being continued at Stanford University under the
goneral direction of Prol. IV. F. Dmand.
The Bureau of StanclaT<ls has und~rtaken fom' investigation for the aerodynamics committee:
1. Development of open ca.le altiIl1eter.
2. Diaphragms and ela tic fatigue.
3. Altitude correction for air speed indicators.
4. General report Oll aeronautic instruments.
The fu'st three of these are definite experimental problem while the fomLh consists not
only of a ummary of recent experin1.entn.l itnT
estigation of instrum nts carried out~n cooperation with the committee at the Bureau of Standarcl , but will go fmther and embrace a general
survey of the state of this subject at the close of the war hoth in tho nited tate and abroad.
1. The work on the open scale altimeter has progre ed to a point where a work-jng model
of the e sential part of the altimeter, excJu iyo of the indicating mc hanism, has b en a embled
and te ted, By proper theoretical design of the spring and cliaphTagm elements an instrument
has been made whose performance depends on the material of the steel spring almost entirely
and only to a light cleO-fee on the materia.l of the diaphragm. It has been possible to secme
steel nearly free from clastic fatigue effect, although such is not the ca e ,,'ith the alloys used
for the thin flexihle diaphragm. .A a n'sult this instrument has been shown by test to have
less t11an one-third of the fatigue effects (i. e., tli crepancy betwe n increasing and decr asing
reading) permitted by the Bureau of tanclarcls specifications for altimeters. The object of
this work, which will be COl tinued until completed, is to pro\~jde a precision altimeter suitable
for altitude determination in aircraft performance tests.
2. Thin m tallic diaplu'agms, usually corrugate I for flexihility, form a nece aryelement
in a great variety of engineering in truments, particularly in aneroid harometer ' for altitude

equipment for pinning ample diaphragms at the bureau in considerable numbers, in a preliminary tudy of a YarieLy of alloys to elect those which warrant more detailed study, and in
a special study of mechanical ea.soning proce ses. This last phase of the work has led to tho
conclu ion that diaphragm can be oasoned meehanically; that i , artificially aged and thus
brought into a permanent state where they will rep at their performanco in succes ivo te t
unde)' the same conditions. This is done hy repeatod deformation of suitable amount seyeral
thousand times, and is done automaticall)! by a mechanism de igned for the pm'po e.
ome
such sea oninO' process appears to be a noces ary preliminary to t.he comparative mea mement
of tbe eITed of dilrel'ent processes of heat treatment., diirerent compo itions of the alloy, and
diirerent mechanical design. The seasoning proce. ; it will he understood, i not intended to
eliminate olastic fatiO'uo, although it doe alwa roduce iL omowhat. Tho object of the ea oning i to ecure definite and uniform re ults, so that tho e factors which will dimini h the fatiguo
can bo analyzed quantitati,oly.
3. It has hitherto beon taken for granted that Ventmi tubos, when u ed for air- peed indicators, will follow a familiar law which tate that tho uction producod i ' directly proportional
to the density of tho air and to the quaro of the peed.
The object of this investigation is to determine by diroct experiment whether this law
does apply to YontUl'i tubes or whether, on tbo contrary, tbe compre ibility and TISCO ity of
the at,mosphere may cau e ome eirect which 'will complicate the correction of these instrument
for diITerent altitudes. Tbe experiment are conducted in a o-called vacuum wind tunnel
(that is, a very mall air-tight wind tmmel in which reduced pre me, cOlTesponding to high
altitudes may he secmed) . The conclusion ha been reached that the instruments examined
are free from the eil'ect of compre ibility but not entirely free from the efIect of viscosity.
These experiment are to be completed and brought to a conclu ion which can be expre sed
numerically for the purpose of correcting such instruments when u ed in aircraft performance
test.
4. The general report on aeronautic instruments pre ents the re ult of investigations
made dming the war by the Bureau of tandarcls to determine the characteristic somce of
error of the ,arious types of instrument. Ta hometers, for example, for mea ming the revolution per minute of the propeller shaft are built in a variety of diirerent types, operating on
di,er~ o phy ical principles. There are the chronometric, centrifugal, magnetic, electric, ail'
vi cosity, air-pump, and liquid t.ype. , each of which has its own characteristic somce of error.
Aside from the orclinary errors met in engineering instruments, such a incorrect calibration,
parallax, looselless of friction in the mechanism, ela tic hysteresi ,and ecular change, tho e
u ed on airc),aft may be fmther inCluonced hy the physical condition' peculiar to aviation, viz,
(1) extreme drop of pre ure, (2) extreme change of temperatme, (3) vibration, (4) acceleration
or inclination. Be -ide the abo,e 1'e ulLs thi ' report, which is nearly completed, giye a do cl'iption of the in trument collected by the Bmeau of tandard in cooperation with this committee
dming the war, including those of BriLi h, French, Italian, Russian, Danish, and German
construction.
In the light of that report it will be evident that the object toward which in trument
deyelopment work should chiefly be directed in the immediate futme may be ummarized as
follows:
1. Open cale instruments for performance tosLing of aircraft. These need not nece sarily
be so compact, light, or rugged as ser vice instruments, and hence o[er freedom for such design
as will insure the highest accmacy.
2. Instrument for long distance navigation, including an ab olute or ground speed indicator, and such a form of gyro copic stabilizer as may bo needed for mounting Lhe instruments.
3. In trumonts to guide the pilot in flying through fog, such as more reliable gyro tmn
indicators and compasses .
4. BeLter material for springs and diaphragms and a more y temaLic determination of the
thermal and ola tic con tants of Lhe materials.

The Bureau of Standards has developed (primarily for)he Air Mai(Service) a field-marking
radio device which enable a pilot to steer directly to the center of his landing field, although it
may be obscured by clouds, rain, snow, of fog. This apparatus utilizes the same transmitting
equipment for the ordinary radio direction finding signals and for the landing signals. The
landing signal are projected vertically as an electromagnetic cone of great in ten ity, which
can be heard satisfactorily at an altitude of three to four thousand fee t. The device enable
the pilot to fiTst find the approximate vicinity of a landing field and then fly directly to its center,
thus making a safe landing in a fog or in the dark. As elevated aerial systems are manifestly
dangerous to air navigation, the Air Mail Service experimented exten ively in r adio transmission
wi th antennas only 20 feet in height, highly directional, and admitting of harp tuning. The
installation of high-powered stations in tbe vicinity of flying fields is therefore made po si ble.
EfJort are being made to provide and perfect a practical visual ignal to take the place of the
present audible signal requiring an audibility of 10,000 to overcome engine ignition interference
noi e. Such a signal will greatly enlarge the field of operation, A new type of gyroscopic
nonmagnetic compa s, intended to overcome the umeliability of the magnetic compass caused
by vibrations and other disturbing inGuences of an airplane in motion, is now being developed
by the Air Mail Service. This compass is nowin a usable form for operation on land or sea, and
only requires such changes a will adapt it to use on airplanes. It consists es €lntiallyof a solid
metal b all floating on a film of compressed air and rotati.ng coordinately in :fi..~ed relation to the
earth's rotation.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON POWER PLANTS FOR AIRCRAFT.

During the year ended September 30, 1919, the activities of the subcommittee on power
plants for aircraft have consisted in the support and general supervision of researches on a
number of power plant problems of importance in aeronautics and in the preparation of a
considerable number of repor ts setting forth the results of the researches.
The committee has maintained olo e relations with the several other agencies engaged in
aeronautic research and de,elopment, including the Army, the Navy, the Bureau of Standards,
the Bureau of Mines, and the several manufacturers engaged in production of power plants and
their accessories for aircraft.
Dynamometer laboratory equipment is being installed in a temporary building on the
grounds of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautic at Langley Field, Va., to be
operated in conjunction ,vith other laboratory facilities of the committee at that point. The
plans call for a series of four electric dynamometers of the following size: 300 to 400 horsepower,
200 to 300 horsepower, 45 to 75 horsepower, and 1.5 to 5 horsepower. All are equipped
with sufficient alLwiary apparatus to permit securing the data necessitated by the researches
scheduled for the attention of this laborat.ory. The purchase of the 200 to 300 horsepower
dynamometer will probably be consummated shortly and the machine used temporarily as a
generator to tide over the period of power shortage in both the dynamometer laboratory and
the wind tunnel.
The following olas ification of the problems relating to aeronautic power plants may serve
as a b asis for an outline of the committee's work for the year:
I. Complete aeronautic power plants units.
II. Component parts of aeronautic power plants units.
1. Heat and pressure cycles.
2. Charging systems.
3. Valve gears.
4. I gnition systems .
.5. Cooling systems.
6. Lubrication system .
7. Exhaust systems.
III. Fuels.
IV. Lubricants.

1. Complete Aeronautic Power Plants Unit.s.

The study of general performance of aircraft engine by the committee bas been confined
to re earch in the .Htitude Laboratory at tl'l.e Bureau of Standard. The work undertaken here
has included performance te ts of a number of Liberty" 13,)) IIispano "180,)) and IIi pano
({ 300" hor epower engines. Te ts ha"e al 0 been made in this laboratory of one Liberty engine
and one Ilispano- uiza 300-horsepowel" engine in cooperation between the Bureau of Standard
and the ail' service engineering department at McCook Field. The engines were first te ted at
McCook Fi Id ann their performance analyzed at ground le\Tel, then they were sent to the BurL'au of Standards for a complete study of their performance at altitudes, after which the same
engines were mounted in planes at McCook Field, to assist in the tudy of plane performance
in IliO"ht.
The collected data from previous test made in the altitude chamber have been utilized
for the preparation of several report which appear in the preceding volume. Further analy is
of the e results i in progre. s and will he continued.
II. (1) Heat and P ressure Cycles.

The general re earoh regarding heat and pressure c:vcles in engine operation may be di,ided
into se,eral part : (n) The re earch for the determination of the rate of flame propagation
in engine cylinclers being carried out at the Bureau of Standard and mentioned in the last
annual report ha been continued and a considerable amolmt of valuable data collected. The
result show that t.he propaO"ation of flame in cylinders under normal condition is much lower
than ha often been a sumed. This rate plays an important part in the performance of an engine .
A very comprehen i ve eries of measurements is in progress which, when completed, will undoubtedly assist in clearing up many exi ting uncertaintie ' as to the cliffcrences in thc behavior of
dirrerent iueb in engines. (b) In parallel wit.h the above the development of high-speed gas
engine indica.tors ha been continued, and in addition to the optical indicator mentioned in the
last volume ther has been developed at the Bureau of tandards a new type of balance pre me indicator which gives re uIt in many re pects far superior to anyt.hing of the kind obtained
previou ly. This indicator i being applied to the accurate recording of not only compression
and explo ion pres. ures but of intake manifold, exhau t manifold, and cylinder intake and
exhaust pressures with a very high degree of accuracy. It is a.dapted for u e in the II altitude))
chamher where the engines are inacce. , ible during operation and is being applied to the tudy
of cylinder pres ure under the e condition. The so-called II integratinO"" indicator in variou
forms is receiving attention and one wiU be devrloped at the Langley Field laboratory.
II. (2) Charging Systems.

(a) ilfuch experimental work has been in progress on the subject of supercharging of engines for high altitude IlgJ:t and several line of attack are being followed by different intere ts
both in America and abroad. The careful study of thi. ubject unclertaken by the committee
last year led to the deci ion that one promi ing line of attack was not being followed out e1 ewhere and it was decided to pn h forward work along thi line.
The committee has had constructed an experimental super harging hlow"er of the positive
(Root) type de. ignecl by one of its member and uitablo for application to the Liberty" 13"
engine. This apparatu will be O"iven preliminary te ts at the Langley Fioldlaboratory, after
which it will be mounted on an engine and subjected to performance tests at. that Jabor-atory
and probahly al 0 in t.he II altitude chamber" at t.he Bureau of Standard.
uc os fu l development t.o this point will be followed by test in Hight eitha at Langley Field or at McCook Field.
(b) A preliminary tudy of the efTects of temperature Oll engine performance ha been
completed showing that thi problem is an extremely complex one and will require a large
amolmt of aclclitionalresearch, which is provided for during the cominO" year.
(c) The. tudy of mean for producing proper automatic compen ation for altitude in aircraft carburetion ha included experimental analysis, by means of the carbur tor test plant
insta..lled at the Bureau of Standards, of three distinct type. of altitude compen ation , the performance of six different design of carburetors at aJtitudo , a car eful study of a number of

mechanisms operated by air pressme, study of tbe fuel jets in several types of carburetors,
and the effects of air ternperaLme on the metering characteristics of these fuel jets. The main
results have been incorporated in reports which appear in the preceding volume.
(d) A preliminary stucly has been made to determine the effects of the pulsating flow
which normally occms in carbmetors, on Lhe behavior of carbmetors and of the various means
of compensation for altitude. The results obtained to date serve only as an indication of
effccts whicb may prove important when furtber investigated, whic:h the committ.ee plans to do.
(e) No work has been done the past year on flow through poppet valves, but the subj ect
'will be resumed at Langley Field the comlllg year.
II. (3) Valve Gears.

o work has been done specifically under this head.
II. (4) Ignition Systems.

(a) The study of spark plugs and ignition systems has been continued actively at the Bureau of Standards under the general supervision of the committee. The new spark plug porcelain developed at the bureau last year founli wide application in the industry. A large number
of diffcrent types of spark plugs have been carefully tested. The characteristics of several
magnetos and other igniLion devices have been studied.
Oomprehen ive reports have been prepared covering the re earches in ignition, as this
investigation has 110W reached a point where it may be considered practically complete as
regard the characteristics of park plug and magneto ~ . rrhere remain to be completed the
development of means for using auxiliary spark gaps to overcome fouling of spark plugs. Some
work on thi subjeet ha been in progress mo t of the year, but con iderable remains to be don e.
The Air Mail Service has supported the development of a gla s and mica park plug which
is giving long life and freedom from fouling. A.Ilotber quite diiIerent type is showing about
equal lifE', indicating that the spark-plug problem in commercial flying is olvable in more than
one way. Ignition reliabiliLy in this service is further increased by tbe addition of a reserve
Lorage battery.
(6) A research undertaken to determine the cau e. of deterioration in high-tension ignition
wiring has been completed. The formation of ozone due to the high voltage is the immediate
cause of deterioration and certain materials are found ,,,hich resist this action.
(c) A satisfactory determination of the effects of spark intensity on rate of inflammation
of Lhe charge and on the power of the engine is greatly needed. Much has been done on this
problem elsewhere, but as yet this committee has not been able to undertake a comprehensive
series of tests.
II. (5) Cooling Systems.

en) T e ting of specimens of radiator-core construction at the Bmeau of tandards has
been substantially completed, and dming this year the results of all previou work on these
pecimens have been analyzed and incorporated in a series of reports which appear in this and
the Fourth Annual Report.
(b) Researches are in progre s or completed to determine the pre sm e and temperatme
di Lribution within the cells of typical radiators and the effect of the natme of the surface
expo ed to the air on these relations. rrhe results show Lhat the efficiency of a radiator used aL
high air speeds is ahvay decreased by roughness of the urfaces or by irregular structures which
'
produce turbulence.
(c) An experimental and a mathematical analy i of Lhe problem of air cooling of cylinders
have been undertaken. Among other things it has been found pos ible to calculate the dimenion of cooling flanges to be used ul1der almost any condition, such Lhat they will give the
llULximum of cooling capaciLy with a minimum of metal.
H. (6) Lubrication Systems.

o work has been done under tills sp cific head.

II. (7) Exhaus t Systems.

No active work has been done dm·i.ng the year on the ubject of muffling systems, although
the subject is con idered of importance and will be advanced during the coming year as fast
as po ible.
III. Fuels.

(a) A special research was undertaken in 1917 by private parties under the au pice of the
committee to determine the practicability of a proposed method of producing high-grade
aviation gasoline without the u ual chemical treatment. This work, which wa carried out
at Charleston, W. Va., was completed during the year and the results reported.
(b) Tests of some special airplane fuels have been made at the Bureau of Standards in
cooperation with the committee to determine the suitability of these fuel for aircraft or military use. Among the e, one, an alcohol-gasoline-benzol mi...'\:ture tested at the request of the
J avy Department, gives interesting results in that it appears to reduce decidedly the tendency
of the engine to "lmock" even at extremely high pre sures. A mixture of benzol and cyclohexane, prepared by the Bureau of Mines, was subjected to a very complete seri.es of tests and
shows the same properties as the foregoing a regards tendency to "knock," but show a somewhat higher rate of fuel consumption.
A blended fuel (composed of gasoline, alcohol, and ether) is being used by the Air Mail
ervice and is proving advantageous in operation characteristics and over-all economy, eng.ine
overhauling for carbon removal being much less frequent.
(c) The result of the long serie of tests completed last year and including different grades
of gasoline for u e as aircraft engine fuels have been analyzed and a report prepal'ed covering
these re 'ult. I n general it has been found that for different grade of gasoline there are only
very unimportant differences in horsepower when proper vaporization and mixing of the air
and fuel are secured.

IV. Lnbricants.

The committee ha undertaken directly no work in connect.ion ,vith the study of lubricants,
bu t is in close cooperation with the lubrication research undertaken during the year by the
Bureau of tandards for the War Department. This program ha included the e tablishment
of ~ very complete lubrication laboratory, work being beglill actively in February, 1919. Besides
the routine testing of new and u ed oils in connection with service test in airplane engines, the
laboratory is engaged in the development of improved method of analysis and tests of lubricating oils, including investigation of the tests of demulsification, oxidation, absorption of gasoline and other fuels. A comprehensive series of service tests of oils in aircraft engines has
been completed.
A new type of friction-testing maehine ha been de igned and built, capable of making test
on aircraft engine bearings of all the usual de igns.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON MATERIALS FOR AIRCRAFT.

The work of the committee on material for aircraft during the past year ha been hampered
somewhat by the disorganization which followed the cessation of hostilities. Many of the
inve tigations have, however, been continued, principally tho e Jor the improvement of the
metals used in aircraft construction, par ticularly the light alloys, those Jor the use of metal to

of the committee of the ational Advisory Committee for Aeronautic, the light alloys commit~ee was aboli hed and the work previou ly canied out by that committee wa transferred
to the committee on materials for aircraft. One of the researche pending was the study of
corrosion in sea water of painted and unpainted aluminum alloy metal plate, in which were
included, in addition, some of the ordinary metals of commerce, uch a copper, iron Muntz
metal, etc. These plates were mounted and exposed between high and low tide in sea water at
the following navy yards : Portsmouth, N. H., Norfolk, Va., and Pensacol a, Fla. After three

months' exposure the e were dismounted and the results of the observations are being prepared
for publication. The mo t intere ting fact relating to the aluminum and duraluminum plates
is that the unpaintcd and painted sheet both stood up very well, showing very little effect of
corrosion and demonstrating that it i not nece sary 1,0 paint aluminum sheets for seaplane. ,
etc. The presence of oil in the water in one of the navy yard probably has influenced orne of
the detailed re ults.
2. Pure aluminum.- The committee on light alloys considered that it was of very
considerable importance to obtain aluminum as free as possible from the usual impurities
of iron and silica, thus affording a basi for a tructural study of such alloys a duraluminum.
This work is progl'essing at the Bureau of Standards.
3. Metal airplane construction.- The work done on metal airplane wing construction during
the war was succe sful, although .the designs which proved satisfactory were perfected too late
to be produced in quantities. It is believed, however, that the foundation is laid for the manufactUl'e of metal wing structure for commercial planes as soon a they arc required in quantitie
which will warrant the expense necessary to provide tool, dies, etc.
Further tests could, however, be advanLageously made Oll wing structures for which steel
tubing is used for the £lal ges and lattice member for the beams.
4. Fi1'eproofwing covering.- The study of fireproof wing covering and aloof tran parent
wing coverings ha been undertaken at the Bureau of Standards. Th theoretical study of
this problem, now practically completed, shows that several methods of constructing a fireproof covering appear feasible. Experiments to det.ermine their trength and resi tance to
combustion are now in progress.
5. Transparent wing covering.- The problem of ecuring tran parent covering, especially
if it is to be noninflammable, is of unusual difficult , principally due to the poor optical propertie of uch a film and the probability that it will lack trength. These are matters which
are receiving careful study and upon which it is helieved that definite conclusions will be reached
in the near future.
6. Fabrics for aircraft.- Most of the work was a study of tautnes , tear 1'e i tance, and
dop e p netl'ation . . The development of a heavy fabric for large airplane was also undertaken,
as well as the development of a light-weight balloon fahric in which an investigation wa made
of the variation of permeability of the fabric for fabrics having different tlu'ead counts.
one of these important researchc is yet fiui, heel, but all are being pushed to completion
a rapidly a conditions will permit.
Among the-problems which are considered worthy of careful tudy are ome of the many
' uggestions and de igns for reinforced airplane fabrics.
Little work has been done on airplane dopes and varni hes during the past year.
Subcommittees.- In order to carryon the work of the committee more eIrectively, tlu'ee
uhcommittee have been formed. They are:
Subcommittee 1: Metals.
ubcommittee 2: Woods and glue.
ubcommittee 3: Ooverings, dopes, and protective coverings.

CO CLUSIO .

The cience and art of aeronautic made wonderful progre s during the war, due to the
. timulu of necessity. Over 11,000 aviator w('rc trained in this country, with a 10 of 264
lives in training, and more than 13,000 airplanes were con tructed in the nitecl tatos. There
were great delays, however, in getting an eff ctive air force into action clming the war, due
primarily to the general lack of preparation for war, but particularly due to the lftck of a 'proper
scientifLC and technical foundation before the Wftr.
From the lesson of the war we h'l1oW that fteronauti(' will be the fiT t arm of dden e and
of o11'ense to ('orne into action in future war. Yictory will harply incline to the side that
('stablishes uperiority in the air , though its other force may be relatively weaker than the
enem~-'s. It follow that erious 10 e in indu try personnel, upplies, and communication can
('asil~- h(' inflicted on the enemy, and a do ided supel'iorit~, in the ail', onc(' attained, will be
difficult to OYNcome.

A NUAL REPORT

NATIO~AL

ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Several European nations are making strenuous efforts and comparatively large peacetime expenditures to develop aeronautics and to maintain a trained reserve personnel. In
America we have a force of reserve military aviators, but our peace-time expenditures for the
maintenance of an aircraft industry and the further development of aeronautics are small.
The committee invites the attention of the Congress to the need for providinO' encouragement
for the development of commercial aviation, as well as military aviation, and to the need for
more liberal support of scientific research and experimental work in aeronautics. There arc
many practical problems involved in the development of aeronautics commercially, and the
commercial development, aside from being its own reward, \vill be a di tinct military asset in
time of war, and should therefore be encouraged and guided as far a practicable by tho Go\'ernment. In this connection the remarkable record of the Air {ail ervice is encouraging . '
In the first place the Post OHice Department sought and obtained the advice of the ational
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and through it obtained material assistance from other
agencies of the Government, particularly the iO'nal Corps of the Army. Its continued independent development should be encouraged.
To summarize the more immediate and important matters, the committee strongly recommends to the Congress:
Fir t. That liberal support be giyen to the e timate and programs for the development of
military, naval, and postal air services.
Second. That greater support be given to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
in its program for the continuou scientific study of the problems of flight. Thi is particuhtrly
desirable becau e of the great increase in the number and importance of the problems to he
solved and the reduced volume of exp rimental work conducted by other agencies since th("
signing of the armistice. Greater direct support of scientific research and experimental work
in aeronautics becomes a necessity in view of the limited appropriations for the Army and l' avy
Air ervices and the consequently limited encouragement and limited ability of the aircraft
industry to conduct experimental and development work.
Third. That special steps be taken at once through the proper governmental channels to
encourage foreign tr<.de in aircraft. The committee sugge ts that it may be advisable to send
a special aeronautiCtll mission to South Am rican countries to create markpts for Amrrican
aircraft and to interest and advise the commercial attache of the Depl1rtment of Commerce
and the consuInr agent of the tate Department a to the possihilities of aeronautic in thORO
countries and the ability of the American aircraft manufacturers to meet the needs.
Fourth. That every practicable encouragement be given by the Federal Government to
the establishment of landing field in and by municipalities generally, and as Ileal' the centen;
of activity a possible. The committee especially suggests that the War Department be authorized to cooperate with the various municipalitie at least to the extent of aiding in the Inyoll L
and marking of the fields and the placing of at lea t one hangar on each field.
Fifth. That legislation be enacted for the regulation of ci"ri1l1eril11 navigation, of the issuance of licenses to pilots, of inspection of aircraft, of uses of landinO' fields, etc., that the enforcement of regulations be placed under the Department of Commerce, and that, pending enactment
of definite regulations by Congre s, a board of representati,es of various Government departments and of this committee be authorized to prepare such regulations for the approval of the
ecretary of Commerce. The committee believe'S that air navigation should be regulated ill
much the same manner as marine navigation, and recommends the above as purely temporary
legislation.
Sixth. That a continuing program for the construction of aircraft for the various governmental services be authorized, so as to assure, through the apportionment of relatively small
orders among manufactur rs of aircraft, the existence of a nucleus of an aircraft industry capable of expansion to meet military needs in an emergency.
Respectfully submitted.

CAUSES OF FAILURE OF SPARK PLUGS.
By F. B.

SILSBEE.

RESUME.

It is the purpo e of this report to collect and correlate a considerable amount of
ational
information which ha been accumulated at the Bureau of Standards for the
Advi ory Committee for Aeronautics during the pa t two years relative to the cau e
of failure of spark plugs in aviation engines, It is hoped by defining the various types
of failure to clarify the spark-plug problem and to be of a sistance to the manufacturers
in improving their designs. The characteristics of the ignition system used in aviation gasoline
engines are uch that only a certain maximum voltage can be produced by the ystem even
on open circuit, and if the insulation between the park-plug terminals is reduced the maximum
voltage is correspondingly reduced and no spark will occur if the insulation is too low. The
requirements which a spark plug must meet are, therefore,
1. The maintenance of a gap having a breakdown voHage of about 6,000 volts.
2. The maintenance of an insulation re istance of at least 100,000 ohm.
3. Practically complete gas tightnes .
These requirements must be maintained under pressures of 500 to 600 pound pel' square
inch while immersed in a medium which alternates rapidly in temperature be~ween 0 and
2,500 ° C., and in an atmosphere which tend to depo it soot upon the surface of the insulator.
The various manners in which a spark plug may become inoperative may be enumerated as
follows:
1. Fouling with carbon deposit cau ing short circuit.
2. Fouling with oil deposit cau ing open circuit.
3. Breaking of the insulator.
4. Preignition.
5. Conduction through the in ulator.
6. Electrical puncture of the in ulator.
7. Minor trouble, such as warping and breaking of electrodes, etc.
Experience in the altitude laboratory at the bureau and authoritative information received
from France indicate that the fir t type of failure accounts for over 50 per cent of the trouble
encountered in practice, particularly at high alti't ude ; the third type of failure accounts for
nearly 40 per cent of the trouble; the second type of failure occurs quite frequently when fir t
starting an engine, but very seldom develops after the engine is once running. The other type
of failure are of relatively rare occurrence, but must be kept in mind in the design of spark
plugs, since departure from the conventional de ign i very liable to produce one or another
of these types of failure.
In the report the caus'e and identification of each type of failure are described in detail

INTRODUCTION.

It i the purpose of this report to collect and correlate a con iderable mass of data and
information which has been accumulated at the Bureau of Standards during the past two
years relative to the cau es of failure of spark plug in aviation engines. It is hoped by defining
Lhe variou di tinct types of failure which are liable to occur and by indicating their relative
importance and, where possible, the remedie for them, at least to clarify the park-plug problem and to be of ome a dance to manufacturer in improving their de ign. Owing to the
fact that the variou~ types of failure often require rernedie which are conflicting in character,
only general conclu ion an be drawn, and any design of plug mu t require a balance between
oppo ing factors, the relative importance of which depends upon the type 01 engine in which
Lhe plug is to be u ed .
The , ource' from which tbi' data ha been obLained are ornew-hat varied. There i at the
Bureau of SLandards an altitude laboratory in which aviaLion engine are te ted while in a
vacuum chamber, so arranged a to duplicate quite closely the conditions of operation in an
airplane flying at high altitude. Records have been kept of a large number of spark plug
u cd in the engine which were being subjected to various te t~ in this chamber and the different
spark plug troubles which occurred were noted. It i believed that the conditions of operation
at any given altitude in this tesL chamber are entirely comparable with those in actuaillight,
but in tudying the data it mu' t be remembered that the proportion of the time at which t.he
engine wa~ operated at variou altitudes may be 'ornewhat different from that occurring in
actual ervice in the field.
Laboratory te ts ha e been made on a wide variety of plug which are hown in the accompanying photographs. A description of the methods u ed in the e laboratory te ts . will be
found in Part III of this report. The pm'po e of these tests was to measure certain propertie
(ga tightness, mechanical strength, etc.) of the spark plugs of each type and to form a basi
by which the relation between these various properties and the service performance could be
correlated.
Re ult have also been secured of ome extensive studies made in France at various flying
fields of the American Expeditionary Forces on the performance of various French spark plugs
in a number of French aviation engines, This work was under the supervision of Lieut. L. B.
Loeb, who had previously been a member of the ignition staff of t,he Bureau of Standards and
who was intimately familiar with the laboratory tests there conducted, and the data which he
ha upplied can be directly compared with data obtained in this laboratory.
In addition to these three principal sources, numerous conferences have been hold with
ayiation officers and engine builders, as well as with spark plug manufacturers.
CONDITIONS OF OPERATION.

The u ual type of. ignition system used with gasoline engines consists essentially of an
induction coil, the primary cmrent of which may be provided either from a battery or by the
motion of the coil it elf in the field of a permanent magnet, as is the case in the high-tension
magneto. In either case, the essential features of the operation of this type of device are,
first, that with its secondary circuit open the voltage of the coil will build up to a certain definite
limit, approximately 10,000 to 20,000 volts; and, second, if the secondary is closed, either
through a shunting resistance or through a spark gap which is broken down and is permitting
the passage of a current of electricity, then the maximum current delivered by the secondary
of the coil is limited to a value of from 0.05 to 0.10 ampere. In many cases the maximum
voltage of the sy tern is limited by a afety gap to a value somewhat Ie s than the inherent
limit referred to above, which is fixed by the inductance and capacity of the circuit and the
current at b r e a k . " ·
.
The voltage required to produce a spark in the cylinder of a high-compression aviation
engine is approximately 6,000 volts. (For a discu sion of the effect of the pressure and temperatme of the gas on this voltage, see Report o. 54.) Consequently, when the spark plug is
I(

PARK PL G DEFECTS A.r D

TJ~STS.

45

clean, there is a considerable factor of safety. If the plug is shunted by even a very high
re istance, the maximum voltage reached i materially reduced and with a lower value of
resistance than about 100,000 ohms, the voltage may be insufficient to produoe a spark. The
magnitude of the effect of a shunting resi tance may be estimated from the relation that the
voltage across the plug previous to the passage of the spark is equal to the product of the
shunting re istance by the current flowing through it. Thus, for example, if the secondary
current of the coil is limited to 0.08 ampere and the shunting resistance is 50,000 ohms, the
maximum voltage available is only 4,000 volts and no spark will occur. The requirements of
the spark plugs are, therefore, to maintain a gap the sparking voltage of which does not greatly
exceed 6,000 volts, and to maintain an insulation resistance across this gap which is considerably
greater than 100,000 ohms. The plug must also be gas tight under the conditions of pressure
and temperature existing in the engine.
While much remains to be learned as to the conditions existing in modern aviation engines,
the pressures and temperatures met with are roughly as follows: The pressure on the plug
alternates between a slight suction during the intake stroke and a pressure of 500 to 600
pounds per square inch during the expansion stroke. There is a considerable vibration of the
engine as a whole, which is at times sufficient to crack porcelain insulators. In rotary engines
the centrifugal force acting on any part situated near the periphery may exceed 500 times
the weight of that part. The incoming charge of gas mixture during the intake stroke may
be several degrees below zero in cold weather or at high altitudes, while the flame of compressed
and burning gas which surrounds the· plug during the expansioI} stroke may reach a temperature
of 2,500 0 C. These alternation of pressure and temperature occur with a frequency of about
15 cycles per second, and the fluctuations in temperature can not penetrate to any appreciable
depth in the insulating material of the plug. The resultant effect is that the inner end of the
insulator and central electrode reach an average temperature of approximately 900 0 C.; the
body of the insulator well up in the shell seldom exceeds 200 0 C.; and the shell itself is in
contact with a jacket containing water at 70 0 C. (Report ro. 52 gives some data on temperatures observed in spark plugs with brass and steel shells when operating in aviation engines.)
The various manners in which a spark plug may fail to operate under the conditions jURt
described may be enumerated as follows:
(1) Fouling with carbon deposit causing short circuit.
(2) Fouling with oil deposit causing open circuit.
(3) Breaking of the insulator.
(4) Preignition.
(5) Conduction through the insulator.
(6) Electrical puncture of the insulator.
(7) Minor trouble, such as warping and breaking of electrodes, etc.
DISCUSSION OF TROUBLES.

These classes of failure will be discussed in detail in the following paragraphs:
(1) Fouling by carbon deposits.-This trouble is due to the deposit of a layer of carbon
upon the surface of the insulator or to the formation of a cake of carbon immediately between
the electrode surfaces. This carbon is due to two causes: (a) The chilling of the flame by a
cool portion of the plug, which thus renders combu tion incomplete. This effect is particularly
common when the mixture of gasoline and air is too rich in gasoline and is consequently of
frequent occurrence in operation at high altitudes in cases where the carburetor is not properly
compensated for the deCl'ea e in density of the atmosphere at those altitudes. (b) The second
cause for carbon deposit is from the decompo ition of lubricating oil which may be splashed
or sprayed on heated portions of the insulator. The lubricating oil itself is an' electrical
insulator, and when it wets a layer of soot on the spark plug it tends, by surrounding each
particle of carbon, to make the entire mass an insulator. Gradually, however, such a deposit
chars under the action of the flame and becomes more and more conducting.

46

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE lTOR AERONAUTICS.

In thi process the oil acts as a binding material for the oot and al 0 increases the rate
of deposition, because particles of carbon in the flame may adhere to the oily surface in tead
of remaining in suspen ion in the flame and burning later in the stroke. 'rhe conduction
tbrough the deposit thus formed seem to take place along a narrow path where the oil film
between the particles has been broken down by the electric stress rather than as a uniform
conduction o,,"er the whole surface of the in ulator.
This trouble seems to be the most frequent source of failure of spark plugs. Records
kept in the altitude laboratory show over 50 per cent of the spark plug troubles to be due to
this cause.
The reports from France also corroborate this statement. As would be expected, the
trouble is more serious at high altitudes than at low, and seems to occur more readily with
mica than with porcelain plugs. This is probably due to the somewhat rough surface of the
mica, which causes the carbon to adhere more readily.
While the engine is in operation, such fouling causes misfiring of the cylinders, or, in case
there are two plugs in one cylinder, one of which remains clean, there is merely a slight loss in
engine power. On removing the plugs from the cylinder a heavy deposit of carbon is at once
evident. It should be noted that spark plugs may appear very black and heavily sooted and
yet show a high resistance, owing to the fact that the carbon particles are not in direct contact
but may be insulated with a :film of oil. After long use porcelain insulators frequently take on
a film of reddish-brown color, which, however, does not tend to hort circuit the plug and which
must be distinguished from fouling with carbon.
The possible remedies for this type of failure lie (a) in improving the design of the plug
(b) in improving the carburetor s:vstem, and (c) in modifying the ignition system.
(a) 'rhe insulator of the spark plug may be so shaped by the use of petticoats, ridges, or a
long conical projection that a portion of this surface operates at a very high temperature.
With this arrangement all carbon deposit is burned off during the early part of the combustion
of the charge while the gas in the cylinder still contains an excess of oxygen. This type of
construction is particularly useful in engines which are well cooled , but in engines which are
very hot and of high compression normally, this construction may tend to cause preignition.
An alternative method of design is shielding the insulator with a metal bailie plate, which prevents the access of oil and its resulting carbonization. This is u eful in engines in which a large
amount of oil is u ed, or in which the plug is so located. as to be particularly exposed to a spray
of oil. With this construction, however, there is usually little opportunity for a carbon deposit
to be burned 011', and if such a plug happens to become fouled at light load or high altitude, it
will not come back into service at fuHload or low altitude.
(b) It is probable that the development of new types of carburetors which is now in progress
will greatly reduce the occurrence of excessively rich mixtures in planes flying at great altitudes
and will thus tend to reduce this source of trouble.
(c) Certain special types of ignition systems have been devised which are particularly
suited for firing plugs which are shunted with a fairly low resistance. The usual an-angements
of such systems is to connect an auxiliary spark gap in series with the spark plug. (A discussion of the use of such systems will be found in Report No. 57.) With devices of this type,
it has been found possible to produce regular firing in an engine in which the plugs were
deliberately fouled' so as to have an insulation resistance of only 5,000 ohms.
(2) Fouling with oil.-This trouble occurs in cases where the lubricating oil fOI;ms a coating over the surface of the electrodes or forms an actual drop between the electrode points.
Since the breakdo'Yll strength of oil is several times that of air, the voltage required to produce
a spark under these conditions is very greatly increased and may exceed the voltage which the
ignition system is capable of delivering. If the insulation of the spark plug is at the same time
omewhat reduced by the presence of soot, the maximum voltage which the system will give
correspondingly reduced.
This trouble usually occurs when there is an excessive amount of lubricating oil in the
~ylinder and this condition arises most frequently on starting an engine when it has been turned

over several times with no flame in the cylinder which might serve to burn off the film of oil.
The condition is also met with when the plane is recovering from a long O'lide, during which
the engine was turning over slowly and pumping oil into the cylinders. This trouble is particularly annoying to mechanics in charge of aviation engines, since it occurs at starLing when
they are working on the engine, and it frequently gives a bad reputation to an otherwise good
plug. It is rather rare, however, that the trouble arises in an engine after it has once been
started. The trouble may sometimes be identified by the firing of the magneto through its
safety gap, thus indicating that the voltage required to pass a spark at the plug is greater
than that required to break down the safety gap. On removing the plugs from the engine
when failure has occurred from this cause they will -be found wet with fairly clean oil.
The remedics for this trouble are found in modifying the design of the electrodes. A
number of hapes have been used as shown in the photographs, which serve to drain the oil
away from the spark gap by capillary forces. Experience with various French plugs has indicated that this trouble occurs most frequently in plugs in which one electrode consists of the
wall of the spark plug shell as in the Ponsot, Joli, and Rudex plugs.
The trouble is, of course, reduced by avoiding excessive amounts of lubricating oil in the
cylinders and by occasionally opening the throttle of the engine while making long glides and
thus burning out the accumulated oil before the amount has b come exce sive. This procedure is common practice. Certain types of high frequency ignition systems have been devised
which are capable of giving a much greater voltage than the ordinary types of system, and
one of these
with these the trouble from oil fouling would probably be much reduced.
systems is at present in common use so that n0 field experience is available.
(3) Oracking of insulator.- Any crack in the body of the insulating material may permit
the passage of the spark from the central electrode to the shell in such a location that it does
not cause ignition of the explosive gas mixture. The thickness of the insulating wall in many
plugs is so great that a spark will not pass directly through a clean crack in the insulator and
the engine may run for some time even ,,-hen the plug is badly cracked. In time, however,
the cracks in the interior of the plug become filled with carbon from the flame and will finally
conduet sufficient current to prevent sparking at the electrodes. Of course, any broken pieces
of porcelain which may be cracked from the insulator are very dctrimental to the engine.
The factors which may cause cracking are several. The mean temperature gradient from
the hot inner end of the insulator to the relati-vely cold shell causes the hotter portions of the
insulator to expand to a greater extent than the cooler, and sets up stresses in the insulator
itself which may cause cracking. Such cracks arc particularly likely to originate .where there
is a sudden change in diameter of the insulator, as at the shoulder. Also if the metal parts are
so .placed that their greater expansion tends to produce pressure on the relatively less expansible
insulator, cracks may occur as a result. It is probable that in some cases actual drops of relatively cool lubricating oil may strike the hot parts of the insulator and by suddenly chilling
them cause cracks. There seems to be good evidence that in some engines the mechanical
vibration of the engine as a whole is sufficiently rapid and intense to break the porcelain from
purely mechanical causes. Such breakage often occurs in the outer part of the porcelain at the
plane of the bushing or crimping. An impact testing machine has been constructed at the
Bureau of tandards in which the spark plug under test is screwed firmly into the side of a
steel block which is arranged to strike repeatedly against a steel anvil. The velocity of the
block and plug at the instant of impact is about 200 em. per seeond and the blows occur at the
rate of 300 per minute. (For details of this machine, see Part III. ) Certain types of plugs
which gave trouble from cracking in service, also cracked when tested in this impact machine,
the location and character of the crack, though different for the different types of plug, being
the same in both the engine and laboratory tests' for a given type. Since no heat was applied
in the laboratory tests, it seems probable that the mechanical shock was the main cause of
cracking in these cases.
There is also a considerable breakage of plugs due to accidently striking them with a wrench
or other tool when inserting them in the engine.

48

A NUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

In the Bureau of tandards' laboratory approximately 40 per cent of the failures which
occurred with porcelain plugs were due to cracking of the insulator. The reports from France
indicate that considerable trouble has been experienced from this cause, and that as a result
mica plugs arc much more popular, and only a relatively small proportion of porcelain plugs
are now used in that country. A plug which has failed in this manner usually shows continuous
misfirings, although in the case of a small crack the missing may be irregular. On removal of
Lhe spark plug, the crack may often be 10 ated by the grating sound heard when the plug is
3trained by the fingers, in cases where no crack is visible at the surface.
Mica plugs are, of course, practically free from this source of trouble and the most obvious
remedy with porcelain plugs is to use a material which shall combine at the same time a high
mechanical strength, a low modulus of elasticity, a low coefficient of thermal expansion, and a
high thermal conductivity. During the past two years very considerable progress has been
made by a number of lorcelain manufacturers in developing insulating materials which are
superior in these resl ects to those formerly used. (Report No. 53 , Part III, contains a description of a development of one of these types which was carried out at 'the ceramic lal oratory of
the Bur au of Standards. )
ertain plug designers have endeavored to avoid trouble from tIus source by making their
insulator in two or more pieces as is done in the Pognon and Duffy spark plugs. In these plugs
the innermost porcelain attains a relatively high temperaLure and expands correspondingly
while the outer pieces are cooler and expand only slightly. The passage of a spark betweon the
central electrode and the shell through the joint between the porcelain sections is prevented by
a WI'apping of mica around the interior of the shell and around the electrode, respectively. It
is, however, ery difficult to make plugs of this type gas tight.
In plugs in which the central electrode is cemented in the porcelain throughout the greater
part of its length, it is essential that the diameter of the electrode be kept small in order thai
the total amount of its thermal expansion may be taken are of by a yielding of the cement
without setting up excessive strain in the inclosing porcelain. Closed-end plugs serve to reduce
the trouble from the spraying of drops of cold oil upon the hot insulator, and the resulting
splitting off of bits of porcelain. They also tend to prevent any broken pieces of porcelain from
getting into the engine cylinder.
Breaking of the insulator by the mecha.nical vibration of the engine seems to be materially
reduced if the insulator is cushioned by a considerable thickness of packi.ng material, such as
asbestos, placed between the shoulder of the insulator and the bushing. The plugs in 'which the
edO"e of the shell is crimped over the shoulder of the insulator, commonly called the one-piece
type, have given considerable trouble from cracking of the porcelain at the edge of the shell.
This effect seems to be due in part to the rigid connection between the shell and the porcel~in,
which transmits the mechanical shock of the engine without any cushioning, amI in part to
stresses set up in the porcelain by the shrinking of the metallic shell after it has been heated
during the process of crimping. These troubles can be materially reduced by proper design of
the tool used in making the j oint. Variations in the proportions of the plug make a decided
difference in its resis tance to brealang from mechanical shocks. Two extreme types of design
are illustrated in plugs 74 and 76. Though these were both of the same material, the long and
slender porcelain gave decidedly more trouble from this cause.
4. P1'eignition.- This trouble, when chargeable to the spark plugs, is the result of too high
temperatures occurring at som part of the plug, either the tip of the insulator or end of the
electrode, or other small projection, resulting in ignition of the charge in the cylinder before the
end of the compression stroke. Preignition may occur from several causes not connected with
the spark plugs, as for instance, from overheated portions of the combustion chamber, such as
hot exhaust valves, from hot points or flakes of carbon or other material lodged in the cylinder
and heated by compression of the charge adiabatically to a temperature where ignition occurs
spontaneously. There is probably a definite relation between the maximum compression
pressure and the tendency to preignitefrom hot points, since the higher the compression the more
readily is the charge ignited.

The importance of this cause of trouble seems to have been somewhat overestimated. It,
has been observed only in rare cases in the engines tested at the Bureau of tandards, and reports from France show it to be of minor importance. In cases 'where the spark plugs are
leaky and are consequently unduly heated by the passage of gas through them, temperatures
which will cause preignition, however, may often be attained . The danger of preignition,
moreover, limits the extent to which the design of spark plugs can be modified in the direcLion
of maintaining high temperatures, and prevents the use of otherwise desirable designs which
would operate at such high temperatures as to insure the burning off of the deposits of carbon.
Definite identification of this source of trouble is quite difficult without the use of an engin e
indicator, but mechanics familiar with the running of the engine can often judge by the noise
and vibration when preignition is occurring. In some cases ignition from overheated plugs
may oceur before the inlet valve has closed. This results in the familiar "popping back" in
the carburetor and may constitute a serious fire hazard on a plane. A careful distinction should
be made between true preignition, and what may be called "afterfu'ing." This latter phenomenon consists in the continued operation of the engine after the igni bon system has been
cut off, as a result of the ignition of the charge from heated surfaces within the cylinder. Ignition from such surfaces is slow and has the effect of a greatly retarded spark. The combustion
in such cases is relatively late, does not yield much pQ.wer, and can maintain only a very slow
engine speed. The pressures obtained by this effect probably occur so late in the stroke as not
to interfere with the normal operation of the engine when the electric igni tion is also functioning.
Remedies for preignition, as far as the spark plugs are concerned, are obviou ly to keep
the insulator as cool as possible by making it short and compact. Long central electrodes
should be avoided, and also constructions which tend to permit the formation of flakes of mica,
which, 'owing to their low heat conductivity, will maintain their high temperature thxoughou t
the intake stroke. The use of a copper rod for the central electrode should be effective in this
respect, but introduces difficulties from expansion and oxidation. Other extreme designs
intended to eliminate preigaition troubles have used a hollow central electrode containing a
small quantity of mercury which, being vaporized at the inner end and condensing at the ou ter,
greatly increases the effective heat conductivity of the electrode. Other designs of plugs have
used check valves which allow cool air from without to be sucked past the insulator during the
intake stroke, hut which prevent leakage of gas outward during the remainder of the cycle .
This latter design, however, has not proved practical. There seems to be good evidence that
the exhaust valves operate at nearly as high temperatures as the spark plugs, and they are
probably equally effective in producing preignition where this trouble exists.
(5) Oonduction thTOUgh insulato1'.- It has frequently been stated that case of spark-plug
failures in very ho t engines may be attribu ted to the fact that at high temperatures the insuln,iing materials used in the plug become to some extent conductors of electricity and reduee the
insulation resistance below the 'critical value of about 100,000 ohms. Report o. 53, Part I
and II, describe a series of measurements of this property for various materials and indicate
that there is a very considerable variation between different materials in this respect. As a
result of an exhaustive study of the subject, however, it appears that only in extremely hot
engines and in cases where the ignition system is unusually feeble is failure of ignition likely
to occur from this cause. The early r~ports which were received concerning this cause of
failure have not been confirmed by later information from France, and it appears that the
importance of this cause of failure has been exaggerated. The remedies for this trouble are, of
course, the use of material of high resistivity, such as fused quartz, mica, or some of the porcelains recently developed by the bureau and by certain manufacturers. An alternative remedy
is to use an auxiliary spark gap in series with the spark plug, as in cases of carbon fouling.
(6) Electrical puncture of the insulatoT.-The possibility of a direct puncture of the material
by the igniting voltage is of much interest, though difficult to study quantitatively. In considering this matter the two very different methods of possible electrical failure of an insulating
material must be carefully distinguished, as much confusion has arisen from failure to do this.
The first of these is usually called" dielectric breakdown." This is exemplified by the behavior

of a sample of porcelain tested cold by al plying a lrnown voltage and gradually rai iug this
until at about ,000 yolts per millimeter a park passes tlu-ough the por elain. The voltage
thus obserYCu is called the breakdown voltage of the material and has a fairly definite value.
Under the e conditions the leakage current tL1Tough the sample, even just before the breakdown
occurs, is very small, and the sample is therefore not heated and changed in its properties
appreciahly hy the application of the test voltage.
The second type of failUl"e may be called" conductive brcakdown," and is exemplified by
the hehavior of a porcelain sample tested when hot, say, ut 500 °
At this temperature the
resi tance of a centimeter cube of ordinary porcelain is ahou t 100,000 ohms, and if a voltage
of only 500 vol ts per millimeter (i. e., only one-twentieth of that in the preceding case) is applied
the curren t flowing will be 50 milliamperes, and the power dis ipate'd in the sample will be 250
watts . This would, of cour e, raise the temperature of the ample very rapidly (at the rate of
about 100 ° C. per econd), and the resi tance would con equently drop still lower and the
material would be fu cd and destroyed in a very short time. It can be shown that althollgh
there is a fairly defmite value of voltage and t mperature at which amples tested under identical
condition fail in this manner, yet these value depend very greatly on the conditions of the
experiment, such as the rate of application of the voltage, the ea e with which the sample can
10 e heat to the surroundings, etc., ane! that it is impo sible to a sign any definite breakdown
voltage to the material 'when te ted in thi manner. I t. is evident that the two type of [ailur<;l
depend on entirely diirerent properties of the material, and so far as i Imown there is no connection between the two.
When a porcelain is u,ed in a spark plug it is subjected to rather peculiar electrical conditions. At the instant the contact break er opens the voltage increa e with extreme rapidity
to a value of 6,000 volts. Thi, however, la ts only a few hundred-thou andths of a second .
The spark gap then breaks down and the voltage drop to a few hundred volts and remains at
that value several thousandth of a second. It then drops to zero and remains so for something
like a fifteenth of a second when the cycle is repeated. The total pow'er ou tpu t of the ordinary
ignition ystem is limited to a few "~il. tt,S, 0 it seem improbable that the econd or conductive
type of breakdown occurs in practice. The maximum volta.ge in operation is less than onefifth of the dielectric breakdown trength of the porcelain when cold. It i , however, possible
that this dielectric strength is greatly diminish d at high temperatures and that consequently
plugs may fail from thi cause. If the insulator was punctured by the peak voltage, the re t
of the 'eli charge would he concentrated at the smallregi n of failure and might well be sulIicien t
to produce iu ed spots in the material.
Owing to the rather remote po ibility of this type of failure and the experimental diIfiC'ul Ly
of producing in the laboratory dielectric breakdown withou t conductive breakdown, no mea. mements have been made of the dielectric breakdown strength of in ulator when hot.
(7) Minor troubles. - In addition to the principal cause of failure discus ed above, troubl e
is occasionally experienced from warping of the electrodes. Thi either short cireui ts the gap
or increases it to such an extent that the breakdown voltage required i more than the ignition
sy tem can furni h. This trouble can be remedied by supporting the central electrode to within
a short di tance of the park gap, but many plugs are on the market in which a great length of
unsupported 'wire is u ed.
With prolonged use the surfac s of the electrodes gradually corrode away as a result of
oxidation between the rystal grains.
With the alloy usually used ( i 97 per cent, Mll 3 per cent) this corro ion is very slow
and the life of the plug is almost invariably limited by one of the other types of failure. It i
stated, however, that slight impuritie in the electrode wire greatly accelerate the rate of 01'1'0 ion.
If the con truction of the plug is such that the material is subjected to a mechanical
ten ion, the intercrystalline crack are pulled apart and the deterioration is much ~ore rapid.
Tungsten ha been sugge ted as an electrode material and would appear to be well suited becau e
of its high melting point, low coefficient of e)...rpansion, and high heat conductivity. Preliminary
tests at thi bureau in which sparking was produced for a long period between tungsten elec-

trodes in an atmosphere 01' CO, sho\\'ed very little corrosion. The extreme hardne and rigidity
of the metal, however, makes it diIfLCult to handle in man ufactme, and its adoption for r.om mercial u e is probably not wn,nanted.
In orne cases a chemical corrosion of the el ectrode which ul timately cau e the tip to drop
off has been produced by a reaction between the material of the cement and the metal of Lhe
electrode at the high temperatures of operation. T his matter ha . been discu sed in Report
No. 53, Part IV, and can be rerl.1edied by the u e of suitalle cements.
There seems to be some evidence that with very rich mixtures a depo it of carbon may be
buil t out on the electrode surfaces themselves to such an extent as to shmt circuit the gap.
The heat energy of the park itself is, however, usually sufflCient to burn away such deposits.
E lectrical bru h discharge over the hot surface of the insul ator is occasionally sugge ted
as an explanation of park-plug trouble. AsLudyof tlus effect made in the l aboratory, while not
entirely conclusive, seems to indicate that it is not an important factor. Experiments at atmospheric prcssure and high temperature show that a brush discharge which forms 11 delica Le
purple glow over the urJace of the insulator is produced when sufficiently high volLage from
an ignition system is applied to a park-plug insulator. The vol tage required, however, is
more than enough to cause a spark to jump from the central electrode to the shell. Experiments at higher pres ures (see Report No. 54) and at temperatures up to 760 0 C. showed no
trace of brush discharge in a plug hl1ving a gap width of 2.2 mm., al though the pressure was
raised to such a value a Lo require a sparking vol tage of about 14,000 volts. The lata at hand
indicate that the in rease in pressure in the engine cylinder is as effective in preventing the
bru h as it is the park discharge. Consequently the former might develop only in case there
were a l ayer of gas neal' the ill ula tor which was decideclly hotter and less dense than the gas
in the spark gap. Such a condition i very improbable in view of the turbulent motion of the
cylinder con tents.
GAS LEAKA GE.

Leakage of ga through the spark plug is never in practice sufficiently great to inter fere
with the operation of the engine directly. It does, however, tend to heat the spark pl ug very
rapid ly and cl1uses one or anoLher of the various types of fl1ilure discu sed above. Part II of
this report gives the results of experiment on the ga tightness oi 1:1, variety of spark plug, and
describes the methods oJ Lest which have been found u eful. The general conclu ions reached
as a resul t of this work are that tightne3s is much more a matter of workmanship than of de ign
and that a wide "Variation is to be expected in the tightness of plugs made to Lhe same design
and even by the same manufacLurer.
NOTES ON PLUG DESIGN.

It will be noted from tho preceding cliscu sion that the remedy uggested for one eause of
failure is very often directly opposite to that sugge ted for another, and the proper design of a
spark plug becomes a matter of bal ancing the conflicting requirements. The conditions in
variou types of engines vary quite widely, some having much higher operating temperatures
than others and some having much greater amount of l ubricating oil present in the combustion
space than others. The type of spark plug which is suitable Jor onp. class of engine may fail
to operate another.
The followioO' general statement, however, seem to be justified by the information available. As to the material of the insulator, mica has the great advantage that it will not erack
a are ul t of temperl1ture gradient 01' other rca on. Poreelain, however, is definitely uperior
in resisting the formation of deposits of carbon and is also much Ie s expensive to manufacture.
It may be said in general that the mica plug has to be of very good grade and workmanship to
compete with a good porcelain plug, but is definitely uperior to a plug with a poor grade of
porcel ain.
Assuming equally good workmanship, the method of making the joint between insulator
and shell seems to have little eHect upon the gas tightne of a plug except in certain designs

where the insulator i molded into the s1;1e11 , in which case absolute tightnes can be secured.
The proces of crimping the shell around the shoulder of the porcelain is very liable to set up
strains and cau e cracking of the insulator, but has the advantage of cheapness and rapidity of
con truction.
The shape and arrangement of the electrodes seem to have but little effect upon the operationof the plug, with the notable exception that plug in which the side wall of the shell forms one
electrode are lefinitely more liable to foul with oil and make starting difficult. The breakdown
voltage of the spark gap depends to some extent upon the shape of the electrode tips, but such
variation in breakdown voltage is comparatively slight and can be co~pensated for by a very
slight difference in the length of the spark gap. The use of rather fine wires as electrodes tends
to ea e in starting a any oil film is readily burnt off, but is liable to cause preignition in hot
engines. The use of a central electrode consisting of a disk or similar shape seems to have li ttle
advantage as fur as the park gap is concerned, for while it lightly reduces the likelihood that
all po sible sparking point may be foul d 'with oil simultaneou ly, the danger of short circuiting at least one of the many pos ible sparking points with carbon is correspondingly inCl'ea cd .
The merits which thi type of electrode may have lie in the protection which it may afford
to the insulating material back of it.
Improvements to be expected in the construction of spark plugs eem to be along the lin es
of better porcelain bodies which are Ie s likely to crack and the construction of a molded or
fu ed insulator which will insure absolute gas tightne s. There seems to be al 0 a very considerable field foi: improvement in ignition sy tem so that they will be able to fire a spark plug even
when it doe not maintain the high insulation resistance which is required by the systems now
in u e. There is a great need of definite and accurate tatistical data as to the performance of
spark plugs of different types in various engine under service conditions, a it i Ollly on the
basi of such data that the real worth of any design can be determined, and it is only by the
compilation of much larger amounts of such data than are now at han 1 that more definite
c'onclusion as to the proper type of design can be based.

RESUME.

This report describe the method used at the Bureau of Standards for measLlring the gas
Ligbtne s of aviation spark plug, and gives the result of numerous mea uremenLs by thi method
The p lugs to be te ted are crowed into a pressure bomb and subjected to an air pre sure of
225 pounds per square inch while submerged in oil heated to a temperature of 150 0 C. (302 0
F.). The leakage of air is then measured by the di placement of oil in an inverted beli jar
placed over the plugs. Table and curves contained in the report give the result of measurements tfl.ken on a wide variety of plugs under the above conditions, as well as data obtained
with other values of pressure and temperature.
The data obtained are listed in Table I , and have been analyzed to bring out any relation
which might exist. between the gas tightness 'and the type of construction. For this purpose
the types of construction Were g rouped into five classes, and the average lefl.lmge computed for
each. Table II how thfl.t there is comparatively little difference between the vari ous clas es
and hence indicates that gas tightness is much more dependent upon workman hip than upon
design. This is borne out by many tests.
Successive measurement on a single plug fail to repeat, which is dne to permanent deformation of the shell, gasket, etc. Also a wide variation is found among upposedly similar phlO"s
from a single maker.
INTRODUCTION.

During the past year the Bureau of Standards has hfl.d occasion to Lest for gas tightness
several hundred spark plugs of a wide variety of designs, both AmCl·i .an and foreign. It i the
object of this report to summarize the re ult of these tests, to record whatever conclusions can
be drawn from the data thu obtained, and to describe in some detail the metllods of test now
used at the bureau.
The leakage of gas th.rough a spfl.rk plug is negligible so far as the los of pres ure in the
engine cylinder is concerned, but i of the greate t importance as regard the operation of the
plug. A very slight leakage of the hot gases carries heat up into the body of the plug, rapicUy
raising its temperature, and thus causing one or another of a number of diff rent type of failure

which ultimately destroy the plug.
spark plug its sole important property.
The ordinary spark plug consists of three distinct parts, viz: The central clcctrode, the
shell or outer electrode, and the inSUlating material, which is usually porcelain, mica, or glass
There are thus in general two joint which mu t be made tight, though in some instances manufacturers have constructed both the central electrode and the insulator in two or more pieces.
METHODS OF TEST.

Various methods of test are now in use for factory inspection and for judging the relative
merits of difIerent type of spark plugs . For the former purpo e many manufa turers test the

plugs for pccial aviation wo rk, ali plug aTC discarded which how any leakage on thi test.
Test for deLermininD' the merit of difT rent types are in cren ral more severe.
Foreign military and aviation committees specify several different tests for gao leakage,
two example of which are a follows:
(1) The plug i te ted for leakage through it, under cold oil, at an air pre ure of 10 kilogram per square c ntimeter (142.1 pound per square inch) for 15 minutes.
(2) Oil is pumped into a cylinder, into which the plug are screwed, at a pres ure or 30
ki logram per square centimeter (426.3 pounds per square inch), thi pres me bing maintained for 5 minute.
pre ure of 100 kilograms pel' quare centimeter (1,421 pound per
square inch) is reported to have been reached in the ca e of one plug, but a p lug i dicarded if it leaks at the low pre ure of 5 kilograms p'er square centimeter (71.05 pound per
quaro inch), the results at tho higher pre sure being of relative value only.
While on an engine in operation p lug are sometime te ted for ga tightness by spraying
oil 0\7 01' them; but thi te t i not reliable, a the oil is likely t.o boil when it come in contact
with the hot plug, producing bubble, thus making it lifficult to ten whether it is heat or leakage
that cause the bubb les.
.
The method u ed by the Bureau of tandard for determining ga leakage may bo described
a follows: The pluD's to be tested are screwed into a pre nre bomb, which i then filled with
compre sed air, while submerged in a bath of oil heated to any desired temperature. The
leakage of air through the plug is measured by the di plac ment of oil in an inverted bell jar
placed ovel' the plug.
tandard condition for testing the relative merits of different types of
pluD's are 15 kilograms per quare centimeter (225 pound per qual' incb ) air pres ure and
150 0 C. (30~ 0 F.) temperatme.
The apparatus u ed i hown in figure 1, and consists of a pre sure bomb, an oil tank, two
pre ure tanks with pre sure gauge, a graduated bell jar, and an a pirator. The pre sure bomb
i made from a piece of hexagonal steel with holes drilled an 1 tapped to accommodate six spark
plug, a w 11 a the pre ure connection of one-eighth inch copper tubing. The bomb i uspended from both end by iron trap, which are made fa t to two upright tandards securely
fa tened to the floor. The oil tank i of. ullicient depth to completely ubmel'g the bomb and
pIllD'S when the tank is raj ed. It is balanced by a weight attache 1 to cor 1 running over small
sheave wheels, 0 a to lide up and down ea ily between the uprights which suppor t the bomb.
The tank contain a 1,000-watt heating coil.
Compressed air i obtained from a tank having a capacity of 150 cubic f et at an initial
pre ure of 1,500 pound per quare inch. Another smaller tank i u ed a a low-pres ure
reservoir, in order to maintain a teady pre me while making a measurement. The gauge
used is an ordinary commercial pressure gauO'e reading to 500 pounds.
The graduated bell jar is made of Pyrex glass, and is about 2 inches in diameter and 7 inches
long. The lower end of the jar has an opening equal to its full diameter, while the other end,
drawn down to a diameter of approximately one-fourth inch, is closed by a rubber hose leading to
the aspirator, as shown in figme 1. The jar i graduated at intervals, and the volume between
succe sive marks i accurately known. I n order to fill the bell jar the oil may be sucked up
to the proper level by the mouth, but it is much more convenient to u e a wa.ter a pirator, as
shown in the drawing. Thi con i ts of an upright piece of iron pipe, closed at both ends,
except for a small pipe connection at the top and bottom. The pipe at the bottom is so connected by valve to both the water supply and the sewer that the tandpipe can be emptied
or filled at will by the manipulation of the e valves. The pipe at the top i connected to the bell
jar by a rubber ho e and water bottle, the purpose of the latter being to pick up any oil which
might pa s the bell jar.
In carrying out a measmement the plug are screwed tightly into the bomb, against lead
ga kets, in tead of the usual copper-a bestos one. The oil tank is then raised, submerging
the bomb and plugs, and the oil drawn to the de ired height in the bell jar, after which the

EFFECT OF PRESSURE.

Using the apparatus above described, te ts were made on SIX different types of plugs to
ascertain the relation, if any, between leakage and pressure. As shown by plots 2 to 7 , inclusiT'e, the leakage increases much more rapidly than the pres ure, but owing to the fact that in
nearly every case the leakage failed to repeat on successive trial , no definite relation between
the variables can be deduced.
ince the amount of gas flowing through very small openings,
such as are here considered, and of fixed area, varies only as the first power of the pre sure, it
is evident that the apertures in a spark plug must be opened up very markedly by the pressure
applied in making these measurements .

EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE.

T ests were also made on several different types of plugs to ascertain the eff ect of temperature on leakage. As shown b y plot;; and 9, it appears that, a might be expected, no definite
relation exi t between temperature and l eakage, and on succe ive trials the leakage fails to
rep eat, in some ca e changing h y a factor of 10 or more between two te is. It will he noted
that one plug howed a definite decrease in leakage with in crease in temperature, suggesting
that in this de ign the thermal expan ion tends to close the ar eJ·tures r ather than to 01 en them.

RESULTS OF TESTS ON PLUGS.

The results of tests to determine the leakage of plugs cover such a wide range that in expressing the results it is more convenient to make seven classifications, as follows:
Class A, leakage below 0.005 cc. per second .
CIa s A -, leakage 0.005 to 0.01 cc. per second.
Class B +, leakage 0.01 to 0.1 0 cc. per second .
Class B, leakage 0.10 to 0.50 cc. per second.
Class B - , leakage 0.50 to 1.00 cc. per second .
Class C, leakage 1.00 to 5.00 cc . per second.
Class D, leakage over 5.00 cc. per second.
Table I and plot 10 show the average results for each of the various types tested , and also
the number of plugs of each type. In studying these results one should bear in mind the variation to be expected in successive measurements of the same plug, also the variation among
different plugs of the same manufacturer and shipment. This is illustrated by plot 11, 'which
was plotted by dividing the 100 per cent base line into as many equal parts as there were plugs
in each set, and then plotting the observed ga leakage of each plug as the ordinate at these
equal intervals, choosing the plugs in the order of increasing leakage. Consequently the
abscissa corresponding to any point on the graph indicates the percentage of plugs having less
than the amount of leakage indicated by the ordinate at that point.
An endeavor was made, by analyzing the data contained in Table I, to determine whether
Lhere was, on the whole, any relation between the design of the plug and its gas tightness .
For this purpose the plugs there listed were grouped into five classes, as follows: (1) screw
bushing, (2) crimped, (3) taper fit, (4) molded, (5) spun gland .
The average leakage for each class of construction was computed by assigning numerical
values for variou grades of leakage, as follows: D equals I, C equals 2, B - equals 3, B equals 4,
B + equals 5, A - equals 6, A equals 7. Each grarle having a numerical value, the summation
of these values was then divided by the number of plugs in that group .
The general features of each class of construction are outlined below:
In the screw bushing method of assembling, illustrated in Fig. 13, the insulator has a
shoulder, one side of which is seated on a shoulder in the shell, while a bushing is crewed down
inside the shell on the opposite side. In order to make this joint tight, a ga ket, either of brass,
copper-asbesto , or some other soH, heat-resisting material is used. Differen t manufacturers use
various shapes for the surfaces with which the gasket come into contact, some placing the gasket
against the upper shoulder and others against the lower shoulder of the insulator. In one instance
a plug was found with a copper gasket against the lower surface of the shoulder and a slotted
spring-steel washer between the upper surface of the shoulder and the screw bushing. The reason
for this design was evidently to avoid excessive stresses on the shoulder of the insulator while
assembling, and possibly to mitigate the stresses due to vibration while operating on the engine.
The result of this construction was that the cylinder pre sure caused the spring washer to be
compressed, moving the insulator upward from the gasket, which was intended to insure the
tightness of the plug. Thus the gas escaped readily, causing a very leaky plug. From a
mechanical standpoint, had the positions of the gasket and washer been interchanged, so that
the insulator would have been moved against the gasket instead of away from it, when under
pressure, the plug would have been much tighter. Two exceptional cases have been noted in
which the insulating material is mica and the screw bushing has been partially mbedded in the
mica by great pressure. In these cases no gasket is used between the insulator and the bushing,
nor can they be separated without injury to the insulating material.
The crimped hell, a used in the Champion, Titan, and other plugs, is il1u trated in Fig. 15
and is formed by forcin.g the top edge of the shell over a gasket of some oft material, as brass,
copper-asbestos, or aluminum alloy, whichrests upon the upper side of the shoulder of the in ulator.
These plugs give fairly good joints, but have never shown themselves to be ab olutely tight,
although in many cases the leakage was very small . This method of assembly has the disadvantage
that the plug can not be taken apar t for cleaning withou t destroying it.

SPARK PLUG DEFECTS AND TESTS.

61

The taper fit used by several manmactmers, Fig. 14, in all cases that have come to the attention
of thi bmeau, were on plugs of mica or steatite in ulation. The taper fit has failed in all cases
but one to give a perfectly tight joint, this being due, undoubtedly, to the flaky property of the
mica, which makes it very difficult to produce a smooth and hard mface that will stand the
pressme exerted upon it when assembling the plug. One maker has overcome this difficulty
by placing a thin steel jacket over the taper, which in this casc is approximately 45 °. This
steel jacket is strong enough to withstand the pressme upon it, thus protecting the mica
insulation, and at the same time is flexible enough to conform to the smface of the taper
within the shell and form a perfectly tight fit.
The molded-in insulators, illustrated in Fig. 12, as represented by the Ander on plug, consist
of glass which has been forced between the central electrode and the shell while in the molten
tate. It adheres to both the electrode and the shell, and forms an absolutely tight plug. Attempts
have been made to use the moldcd materials, uch a Bakelite and Condensite, in spark plugs; but,
although these may produce a tight joint when cold, the samples thus far submitted have not
been able to withstand the temperatme conditions obtaining in actual service.
The spun gland, which is used upon only one type of plug, is as yet in the experimental stage.
It is shown in Fig. 16. Thi plug uses a porce~ain insulator, the shoulder of the porcelain being
smrounded by a spun brass gland which is part of the screw bushing and projects a very little
below the shoulder of the plug. The in terior of the shell has a taper of 45 0, which comes in contact
with the. edge of the gland. When the bushing is screwed down in the first assembly the edge of
the gland is crimped about the houlder of the porcelain, forcing a tight joint. This plug has
the advantage of being easily taken apart for cleaning, and can be reassembled to give as tight
a joint as at first without the aid of special wrenches. When the plug has once been assembled
and the gland formed the insulator and bushing can not be separated without totally destroying the gland.
So far in the discus ion of methods of assembly nothing has bl3en said in regard to the
numerous ways of assembling the central electrode and insulating material, which vary with
different manmactmers. In the majority of cases the electrode is of uniform diameter throughout the entire length of the porcelain, having a shoulder on the inner end while the outer end
is threaded and made tight by screwing a nut against a gasket or washer, the shoulder and washer
both bearing on the insulator. In some instances both the electrode and insulator are threaded
and screwed together, and a cement is introduced to insure a tiglrt join t. In still other cases
the electrode is cemented to the insulator, there being no other means of fastenil1g these two
parts together. Other manufactmers fuse or mold the electrode into the insulator.
There are certain objections to the use of any form of cement between the electrode and
the insulator, the mechanical seal first described appearing to be the most satisfactory method
of assembly. This matter is more fullyldiscussed in Report 0.53, Part IV, entitled II Cements
for Spark Plug Electrodes."
CONCLUSIONS.

The results obtained from the analy is of Table I arc listed in Table II. It appears from
this table that the molded insulator is definitely superior to the other types in the matter of
gas tightness. The high rating of the spun gland type is somewhat questionable, since all the
plugs tested were constructed e pecially for experimen tal pmposes and did not represen t a typical
output on a production basis. The close agreement of the other classes, combined with the wide
variations shown in Table I between different makes of the same class, show quite conclusively
that the leakage depends much more upon the workmanship than upon the design.
Table III gives the results obtained by grouping the plugs according to the insulating
material used. The good performance of gla s plugs is due to their being of molded construction. The difference between porcelain and mica is too slight to be given much weight; but
indicates that the laminated structme of the mica docs not seriously decrease its gas tightness.
This result is confirmed by a second set of averages, including only high-grade plugs which
are actually used to a considerable extent on aviation engines. The porcelain plugs showed

METHODS FOR TESTING SPARK PLUGS.

RESUME.

The factors which affect the performance of spark plug in gasoline engine are very numerous, ubject to erratic variation, and differ widely with the type of engine. Consequently
definite conclusions as to the ultimate value of a given type of plug can be based only on reliable
statistical data on the performance of a large number of plug. An engine test of a few hours'
duration serves to develop any marked weakness in a spark plug and is the most valuable
over all test. Laboratory tests determine quantitatively certain pecific propertie of a spark
plug rapidly and conveniently, and have three chief functions. These are (1) the indication
of probable weak point in new de igns of plugs, (2) the indication of progress in the develop ment of improvement or the elimination of faults in de ign or material, and (3) a check on
produ tion by means of routine te t . The tests de cribed below have been developed at the
Bureau of tandard for these purposes.
The first test is for the electrical conductivity of the in ulating material while hot. The
pecimen to be te ted is heated in an electric furnace to the desired temperature and the re istance measured, u ing 50-cycle alternating current at 500 volts . The conductivity of this class
of material i found to vary very rapidly with the temperature, approximately obeying a law
of compound interest with an increase of 2 per cent per degree Centigrade. The quality of the
material is therefore very conveniently expressed by stating the temperature (Te) at which
it has an arbitrarily selected resi tivity. This value has been selected as one megohm per
centinleter cube, and a spark plug of the usual construction, made or material of.thi 1'e i tivity,
will have a resistance of about 200,000 ohms. This is lightly on the safe side of the limit
at which the usual forms of ignition system may be relied upon to give regular firing in a high
compression motor.
The following table give some typical results obtained by this method:

The resistance of the insulating material to thermal cracking is tested by heating the specimen to 300 0 C. and then quenching it in water at room temperature. The sample i then
soaked in an aniline dye which renders vi ible any cracks which may be pre ent.
The assembled plugs are te ted for gas tightne s with compre ed air at a pressure of 225
pounds per square inch while the plug is immersed in a bath of oil heated to 150 0 C. This
serve to duplicate the conditions in the engine which may cau e leaks due to the thermal
expan ion of the various. parts of the plugs. The air leaking through the plug is collected in
a glass tube and measured.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The resistance of the plugs to breakage by mechanical shock is tested by screwing the
as embled plug into the ide of a teel block which, by a trip hammer arrangement, is truck
repeatedly against a hardened teel rail. The number of impacts delivered before the plug is
damaged is taken as a measure of its performance.
The cold dielectric trength te t is made by applying 60-cycle voltage from a tran former
to the plug in ulator while it i immm ed in a ve el of oil. The voltage i raised gradually
to 25,000 volts and any puncture of the material icon idered a failure.
The engine te t con ist in running the plugs in a high compres ion aviation engine at
full load for six hours and at light load for one hour, and noting the general performance of
the plugs.
.
INTRODUCTION.

The methods of te t described in thi report have been developed at the Bureau of tandards as a part of the investigation of ignition problems . The object of laboratory tests of this
nature is to determine certain pecific properties of the maLerial or design of the plug under
conveniently controllable condition, both for the purpose of developing improvement in certain particular properties and for comparing the relative merit of different types of plug in
regard to the e propertie , thus permitting the elimination of types notably inferior in any
important characteristic. The engine test serve to bring out any other ource of wealme s
and indicates the general utility of the plua-. It hould be emphasized that prolona-ed running
in an engine of the type in which the plugs are to be u ed i the only ultimate ba is for judging
the merits of a given type.
The tests employed are a follows:
1. Test for electrical conduch,ity of insulating material.
2. Te t for resistance of in ulator to thermal cracking.
3. Test for gas tightne s.
4. Te t for re istance to mechanical vibration.
5. Test for dielectric trength.
6. Engine te t.
These tests are nece sarily in continual process of development, and the directions given
below are subject to frequent revi ion.
ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY.

The measllrement of electrical conductivity is made either on spark plug insulators or on
spccially designed test specimens. In either case the sample of insulating material to be tested
is heated in an electri furnace to the de ired temperature and 60 cycle alternating current at
500 volts is then impressed upon the spe im n between two uitable electrode. A voltmeter
connected between the e electrodes and an ammeter in serie with the specimen are read imultaneou ly and the resistance is taken as the quotient of eff ctive voltage divided by effective
current.
Since the current through the pecimen is rather small, a very sensitive milliammeter i
required and it is u ually found convenient to u e for this purpo e a dynamometer wattmeter.
The fixed coil of thi wattmeter is excited by a lmown current from the arne souree of supply
as the test current through the specimen. The moving coil of the wattmeter is connected in
serie with the pecimen. Such an arrangement provides a higher ensitivity than can be
attained with commercial milliammeters, and is also convenient because of the great range of
current which can be measured by using variou exciting currents. The connections used in
this test are shown in figure 1.
..Measurements made by this method on the same sample are found to give results agreeing
to a few per cent when different voltages, frequencies, and time of application of the measuring
current arc used.
For the accurate measurements of the conductivity of the material, a cup specimen, similar
to the American ociety for Testing Materials' standard test piece o. 1, should be used, though
it is not essential that the side wall of the cup be tapered. Figure 2 gives a cross-section of

The resistivity of the material can be computed by multiplying the

desired resistance of such a cup by the factor K obtaincd from the equation K=

7rf/ where d

is the diameter of the cup and t the thiclrne s of the bottom.
This test cup is filled to a depth of about 2 cm. (0.8 inch) with melted solder, which forms
one electrode, and is in turn set in a slightly larger shallow steel cup containing melted solder,
'which forms the other electrode. This arrangement insures good contact between the electrodes
and the por~elain. To avoid cracking the cup, it is, of course, necessary to insert the solder
in the olid form and melt it by gradually increa ing the furnace temperature. Figure 3 shows
the arrangement of the cup specimen in the furnace. Two thermocouples protected by porcelain
tubes are in erted in the solder in the te t pecimen and in a hole in the Leel cup respectively.
Measurements of resistivity are made only whcn the e two couples indicate sub tantially the
same temperature.
In cases where cup pecimens are not available, actual spark-plug insulators can be tested
by using the centr al electrode as one terminal and the shell of the spark plug as the other. If
the insulator is removed fr()m the shell, a band about 2 cm . (O.S inch) wide at the center of the
length of the insulator is coated with platinum by applying a layer of platinum chloride solution
and then heating this to reduce the chloride and leave a deposit of metallic platinum. This
platinum belt i then u cd a the outer terminal. The pecimen is inserted in an electric furnace,
as shown in figure 4, the temperature of which is indicated by a thermocouple placed in contact
with the shell of the plug.
Measurements obtained on these specimens are accurate as indicating the resistance of
the specimen, but owing to the irregular shape and the uncertainty as to the area of outer
lectrode in actual contact with the porcelain they arc not suitable for accurately measuring
the resistivity of the material. Assuming the usual formula for current :Oow between coaxial
cylinders, the factor K by which the resistance must be mul tiplied to give the resistivity of the
material can be computed by the equation
27rL
K= 231 oglO d u
.
(12
where L is the effective axial length of the electrodc, and d2 and d l arc the diameters of the
inner and outer electrodes. In this computation, it is as umed that the contact is made over
the entire surface covered by the shell of the plug, an 1 consequen tly the values of resistivity
computed on this ba is are too high if this contact is imperfect. It should also be noted that
the path for surface leakage is much shorter in the case of the plug specimen, and i11so that if
the glaze is of poorer material than the body of the plug, conduction through this glaze will
reduce the apparent resistivity. In the cup specimen, on the other hand, the area of contact
and thickness of the bottom of the cup are definite and easily measured. It is found that in
general measurements on plug samples give lower resistivity than those on cup.
The change of resistivity with temperature in this class of materials is so rapid that it is
impracticable to plot resistivity against temperature diroctly, as a scale which is suitable at one
end of the temperature range becomes extremely crowded at the other. It is found, however,
that by plotting the logarithm of the resi tivity against the temperature, a smooth curve slightly
concave upward is obtained. The curvature of this plot is quite small and the data can be
represented within the r ange of temperature used with suiftcient accuracy by a straight line which
more nearly fits the observed points. Plot 5 shows a typical plot of data obtained on a cup
sample.
The points on the straight line give the relation

Log 10 R=a-bt
where R is the resistance of the specimen in ohms and t the temperature in degrees Centigrade,
while a and bare cons tan ts of the curve. Adding log K to both sides of this equation we obtain
Log10 p=a+log1o K-bt=c-bt

where p is the resistivity in ohms per centimeter cube and c a new constant of the material which
is obtained from a by the equation
The constants c and b depend upon the material only and not upon the shape or size of the
particular specimen, and from a knowledge of these constants p can be computed for any tempera.ture by the above equation. Unfortunately neither c nOT b is very convenient a a figure of
merit for the material, since a slight error in either will greatly affect the value of the other.
It is, therefore, advantageous to compute for each material p500 which is the resistivity of the
material at 500 0 C. Another very convenient figure of merit is the t emperature at which the
material has a definite resistivity of 1 megohm per centimeter cube. Thi can be computed
by the equation

This value is given in the r eports of this bureau for each material tested and is the mo t sati factory criterion of its value as an in ulator at high temperature.
An interpretation of the fa t that the results as thus plotted give a straight line can be
obtained by considering that the conductivity increa es with temperature according to the law
of compound inter st, at a rate of about 2 per cent per degree Centigrade. Tills r ate is equal
to 2. 3 X b for each material. The cumulative effect of the compounding is such that an inerea e
in temperature of 100 0 corresponds in the average material to an increase of the conductivity
by 600 per cent.
The following table gives some typical results obtained by this method:

A material having Te less than 400 0 C. should not be used unless the design of the plug is
such as to keep the insulator well cooled. An assemblocl plug having less than 0.5 megohm
resistance at 400 0 C. should be con idered unsatisfactory.
RESISTANCE TO THERMAL CRACKING.

The quenching te t is intended to indicate the ability of the insulating material to resist
cracking due to teep temperature gradient . The in ulator with the shell and central electrode
removed are brought to a uniform temperature of 300 0 C. in a small furnace and then quenched
in water at room temperature and examined for cracks by soaking for several hours in an
alcoholic solution of the dye eosin. The specimen is then broken to determine the depth of .
the cracks. The cracks developed by this test seldom extend entirely through the specimen so
that an electrical te t is not a sati factory for indicating them a is the use of the penetrating
stain. Practically all in ulators will bow some cracks when quenched from 300 0 C. but the
number and depth of the cracks varies very greatly among different specimens and the test
gives a qualitative basis for the comparison of different materials.
TEST FOR GAS TIGHTNESS.

Gas tightness is determined by screwing the completed plugs into a steel bomb and admitting air at a pre sure of 225 pounds per quare inch to the interior. By the use of lead wa hers
in place of the usual copper-asbesto gaskets a tight joint can be ecured between the plug and
the bomb. The entire bomb .is then immersed in a t ank of oil which serves to show the leakage
by the resulting bubbles. The oil is heated to 150 0 C. and consequently heats the plugs apd
develops leaks which may arise under operating conditions due to the differential thermal
expansion of different parts of the plug, The actual I+mount of gas leaking out is measured

total period of six hours with not more than three interruptions, and is then run one hour
throttled down to about 400 re,olutions per minute. If the enO'ine has two plugs per cylinder,
either the plugs to be tested arc put in both sides or, if the number of samples is insufficient,
the plugs are moved in the middle of the test so as to be run for about half the time in each
location. The temperature of the cooling water leaving the engine is maintained between
65° C. and 70 ° C. (149° to 15 ° F.). The temperatures of the oil in the crank case, of the
cooling water, and of the surrounding air are recorded, together with the average power developed and the oil and fuel consumption. At intervals, each igni tion system is cut oil to indicate
missing in the other set of plugs, and any misfiring or preignition due to the plugs is noted.
The plugs are examined at the end of the run to determine if any corrosion or warping of the
electrodes, as shown by a change in the length of the gap, foulinO' with carbon, cracking of the
insulator, or other defect occurred. The plugs arc also subjected to the test for gas tightness
both before and after the engine tests, and if cracking of th porcelain is suspected the insulators are removed from the shells and soaked in an alcoholic solution of eosin to indicate any
cracks which may exist.

RESUME.

This investigation was conducted at the Bureau of Standards for the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics .
Brass has often been assumed superior to steel for spark plug shells because of its greater
heat conductivity. Thc mfflsurements described in this report prove the contrary, showing
that the interior of a spark plug having a brass shell is from 50 0 to 150 0 C. (90 0 to 270 0 F .)
hotter than that of a similar steel plug. Consistent results were obtained in both an aviation
and a truck engine, and under conditions which eliminated all other sources of difference
between the plugs. It is to be concluded that steel is to be preferred to brass for spark plug
sh lIs.
INTRODUCTION.

The measurements described below were undertaken to compare the temperatures attained
in various portions of spark plugs having brass and steel shells. Tte plugs used were of the
R ajah type. The porcelains were especially made with a hollow central (electrode) space of
approximately 2 mm. (0.0 inch) diameter and sealed at the lower end. The temperature gradient along this central axis of the porcelain was measured with a movable copper constan~an
thermocouple. A brass tube about 2 cm. (0.8 inch) in diameter and 15 cm. (6 inches) in length
was attached to the upper part of the shell of each plug to protect the thermocouple and to
support it in any desired position.
MEASUREMENTS WITH PLUGS IN HALL-SCOTT MOTOR.

Two plugs with brass and two with steel shells were placed in the regular spark plug holes
on the exhaust side of a four-cylinder Hall-Scott motor, type A-5a, running at a speed of about
1,500 revolutions per minute, and delivering about 110 horsepower to an airplane propeller.
A separate run was made for each plug and the temperatures measured after sufficient time
had elapsed (about a half hour) for the t emperature to become constant. The temperature of
the discharge water from the cylinders was about 70 0 C. (15 0 F. ) in each case. The following
table contains the results of the measurements. The first column gives the position of the
thermocouple from the bottom of the porcelain: This was limited by the dupth of the central·
space.

MEASUREMENTS IN A TRUCK M OTOR.

Similar measurements were made in a Waukesha truck motor with special cylinder heads
which gave a maximum compression of about 115 pOlmds per square inch. This motor was
connected with a dynamometer and loaded down with the throttle wide open to run at a speed
of 1,000 revolutions per minute. There was no fan or radiator connected but the discharge
water was thermostated at a temperature of 63 0 C. (145 0 F .). Each plug was placed separately in the second cylinder and in the same spark plug hole, which was specially drilled and
tapped in a position originally used for a priming cup. The bottom of the plugs lacked about
2.5 cm. (1 inch) of being flush with the inside cylinder wall. The temperature gradients along
the central axis of the porcelains were measured as before. An additional thermocouple was
placed about 2 mm. (0 .08 inch) witllln the metal of the shell of each plug and level with the
copper gasket below the shoulder of the porcelain.

CONCLUSIONS.

The measurements indioate that the temperatures of the brass shells are considerably
higher than the steel in each case. Also, the temperatures in the center of the porcelain are
higher in the case of brass shells. This difference can not be attributed to difference in gas
leakage, since plug of the same material differing quite widely in leakage gave practically
identical re ult. Al 0, the thread dimen ions were 0 nearly the same that the difference in
temperature can not be due to difference n the contact between the plug and the jacket, and
is apparently due to the difference in the material of the shell. Thi effect is apparently due
to the greater thermal conductivity of bra (0.22 c. g. s. units) as compared with steel (0.11
c. g. s. units). The heat received from the hot ga es in the cylinder by the inner end of the
brass plug is more readily conducted longitudinally to the upper part of .the shell, which is
thus maintained at a relatively higher temperature in spite of the loss of heat from the upper
portions of the shell and insulator by radiation and convection.
ince the. contact between
the porcelain and the plug is above the plane of the engine water jacket, the porcelain is less
effectively cooled in the ca e of the bras plug where the upper part of the metal is hotter,
and consequently shows a higher temperature throughout its length .

RESUME.

This repoi·t describes in some detail the preliminary experiments which were made on the
conductivity of spark-plug insulators in order to develop a satisfactory comparative method
for testing various materials. The measurements were made at temperatures between 200 0 and
900 0 C, and with both alternating and direct current at voltages as high as 2,000 volts.
The results obtained confirmed the experiments of earlier observers at lower temperatures
in indicating a very rapid decrease of resistance with increase of temperature in porcelain,
mica, fused silica, and similar materials. This decrease is, however', a gradual one and there
is no definite temperature at which the material suddenly changes its properties. The results
of conductivity measurements can be most conveniently expressed by stating the temperature
( T.) at which the material has the arbitrarily selected resistivity of one megohm per centimeter
cube. Table 1 gives the values of this constant for various substances.
The measurement with direct current showed the presence of disturbing polarization
effects which make the apparent resistance of the specimen vary with the magnitude and time of
application of the measuring voltage. This effect can be eliminated by the use of alternating
current in making the measurements and the later work on a wide variety of substances, the
results of which are given in Part II of this report, was done by this latter method.
There is a wide field for further investigation of this subject, as the mechanism of conduction
in this class of materials is very complex.
INTRODUCTION.

The purpose of this report is to describe some measurements carried out at the Bureau of
Standards during the past two years, on the resistance of various insulating materials at high
temperatures. This work was undertaken with a view to studying the relative merits of various
insulators for use in spark plugs, and in particular to assist the ceramic laboratory of the bureau in
developing improved porcelain bodies for this purpose. The method finally adopted as a result
of this work for the comparative testing of materials is described briefly in Report o. 51,
Part III, the results of a large number of measurements on a wide variety of materials are given
in Report No. 53, Part II, and the development of the ceramic side of the investigation is given
in R eport No. 53, Part III. The present report will be confined to a description of the various
phenomena observed in the experiments which led to the method finally adopted.
The electrical and thermal conditions under which a spark plug is required to operate
differ considerablY with the type of gasoline engine used. Measurements with embedded thermocouples have shown that the temperature of the body of the insulator within the metal shell
seldom exceeds 250 0 C. in water-cooled engines. The tip of the inner end, however, may reach
temperat~es as high as 900 0 to 1,000 0 C. It therefore, appeared desirable to study the resistivity of the specimens in the range of temperature between 200 0 and 900 0 C.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The electrical stresses applied to a spark-plug insulator by the average magneto or battery
coil ignition system used for firing gasoline engines are quite peculiar and difficult to duplicate in
any method of measurement. The cycle of operation (see Report No. 58, Part 1) following the
opening of the primary breaker contacts consists of a rapid rise of the potential applied to the
spark plug from zero to a value sufficient to break down the spark gap in the engine cylinder .
The break-down voltage is of the order of 6,000 volts and is reached in a few hunch'ed thousandths of a second. After this a comparatively low voltage (800 volts) maintains the electric
arc between the spark points and lasts for a few thousandths of a second. Since the interval
between sparks is of the order of 0.1 second, it will be seen that the average voltage applied over
a complete cycle is quite low and has been found to be approximately 150 volts . These peculiar
electrical conditions should be kept in mind when considering the various methods of measurement described below.
The materials studied in this investigation included porcelains, glass, steatite, mica, and
fused silica, as these constitute the only class of substances sufficiently heat resisting for use
in spark plugs. While the detailed studies of polarization, etc., described in this report were
made on only a few of the porcelain sample, the same effects seemed to be present to gTeater
or less degree in all cases and the process of conduction is probably similar in all of them. The
work of earlier investigators! has shown the complex nature of the phenomena, but as yet no
complete and sa.tisfactory theory has been worked out to account for them.
APPARATUS AND SPECIMENS.

Most of the work reported in this paper was done on cup-shaped specimens similar to the
standard test piece o. 1, adopted by the A. S. T. M., except that the side walls were of uniform
thickness. The cross section of this specimen is shown in figure 1. The principal advantages
of this type of specimen are:
(1) The conduction takes place through the bottom of the cup, which is of definite
and easily measured dimensions.
(2) The large area and small thickness of the bottom insure a relatively large current
even with material of high resistivity.
(3) The path over the rim of the cup for any surface l eakage is relatively long .
(4) A satisfactory contact can be made between the specimen and the electrodes by
immersing the bottom of the cup in a conducting fluid (in these experiments,
melted solder) and by inserting some of this fluid inside the cup to form the
upper electrode.
These cup specimens were used in the furnace shown in figure 2. The heating coil inserted
in the plug below the specimen was found necessary to compensate for the flow of heat through
the bottom of the furnace. By proper adjustment of the relative amounts of current through
the main winding and through this additional coil, the temperatures inside and outside the cup
could be equalized. These temperatures were measured by two copper-constantan thermocouples, one of which was inserted in a closed porcelain tube which dipped below the surface
of the solder in the interior of the cup, while the other was embedded in the steel cup containing
the solder below the specimen. Readings of the resistance were taken only when these two
thermocouples showed substantially equal temperatures.
In cases where cup specimens were not available, measurements were made-on assembled
spark plugs, and also on spark-plug insulators, and on short pioces of tubing. In these cases
the conduction took place between a central electrode and either the shell of the spark plug
or a band of platinum deposited around the center of the outside of the insulator or tube . The
measurements with this type of specimen were definite in indicating the resistance of the specimen, but owing to the uncertainty as to the area of contact and the location of the lines of current flow it is difficult from such data to compute with accuracy the true resistivity of the
material.

PROPERTIES AND PREPARATION OF CERAMIC INSULATORS FOR SPARK PLUGS.

83

For specimens of this shape the electric furnace shown in figure 3 was used, and temperatures ·were indicated by a single thermocouple placed in an iron plug which supported the
speCImen.
For reducing the results of either type of specimen from the observed resistance to a basis
of the resistivity of the material the factors connecting these two quantities were computed
from the dimensions of the specimens. T he resistivity is obtained by multiplying the
observed resistance by the factor K, where for the cup specimen
2

K= 7r d

(1 )

and d is the diameter of the bottom of the cup and t the thickness of the cup in centimeters.
For the tubular specimen
(approx.2)
where l equals the length of the external conducting band measured parallel to the length of
the specimen, and R2 and Rl are, respectively, the external and internal radii of the insulator.
In most of the work the resistances were measured by reading a voltmeter connected
across the specimen and an ammeter in series with it and taking the quotient of these values as
the resistance. AB will be seen from the following, a wide variety of sources was used to provide
the applied voltage, and the indicating instruments were correspondingly varied in character.
VARIATION OF RESISTANCE WITH TEMPERATURE.

The first experiments were carried out with an applied direct-current vo ltage of about
2,000 volts, which was obtained by rectifying with a kenetron a 3,000-cycle voltage supplied
from a step-up transformer. The connections used to obtain this rectification and to reduce the
fluctuations in the resulting continuous voltage are shown in figure 4. This rather complicated
system was chosen in an attempt to duplicate to some extent the voltages existing in ignition
systems, and, although this source of voltage was later abandoned, the data obtained with it
brought out the salient facts in regard to this type of conduction. The most striking of these
facts, as verified by other measurements made later, is the very rapid decrease in resistance of
the specimen with increase in temperature. This variation amounts to aproximately 2 per cent
per degree centigrade at all temperatures. If the results are expressed by plotting resistance
vs. temperature,. or conductance vs. temperature (see plot 5), the resulting curves are so steep
as to render it impracticable to express the data oveT an extended temperature range by a
single curve. It is found, however, that by plotting the common logarithm of the resistance
against temperature, as is done in curve ~o. III, plot 5, and in plot 6 a convenient line of
slight curvature is obtained. It will be seen from this plot that if this curvature is neglected,
the results can be represented approximately by the equation
Log1o R=a-b t

(3)

This method of expressing the results is very convenient in reducing tbe data to a basis of
resistivity, since combining the relation

p=KxR

(4)

LoglOP = a + loglo K - b t = c - b t

(5)

with equation (3) one obtains
In this equation band c are constants of the material and are independent of the shape
and size of the specimen used. Unfortunately, however, the values obtained for one of these
constants depends very markedly upon the other, so that a slight error in one will cause a compensating change in the other. They are, therefore, not well suited for comparing the relative
merits of the different materials and for this latter purpose it has been found convenient to
compute an "effective temperature" (Te), which is defined as the temperature at which the

material has the arbitrarily selected resistivity of 1 megohm per centimeter cube, and which
may be computed from the equation
c-6
(6)
Te= - bThis value of Te ranges from 350 0 in the poorer grades of porcelain up to 800 0 for fused
silica, and is a convenient index of the value of the material as an insulator at high temperatures.
An inspection of these resistance-temperature curves shows a complete absence of any
critical temperature at which the material undergoes an abrupt change in its resistance. This
shows the error of the commonly accepted idea that porcelain .breaks down and becomes conducting at a definite temperature. This belief probably originated from experiments in which
the temperature of a porcelain sample was gradually raised while being continuously subjected
to an applied voltage. The effect of the current flowing through the sample in such cases
would be entirely negligible up to a certain temperature. at which the power

Gf)

supplied by

the measuring current became comparable with the rate at wmch heat could be dissipated to
the surroundings. Owing to the very rapid rate of change of resistance with temperature, a
very slight further increase in temperature would materially decrease the resistance and consequently increase the

(if) loss.

Unless the specimen was in a position to give off heat freely

to its surroundings the temperature would rise rapidly, cau::ling a further decrease in resistance,
thus l~ading to an unstable state which would rapidly cause the fusion of the material and the
passage of an·arc. The rapidity of change of resistance with temperature makes this point of
instability quite definite, provided all the conditions of the experiment are maintained constant, but this apparent critical temperature will depend very greatly upon the contact between
the specimen and the furnace, upon the applied voltage, and the other conditions, so that this
is in no sense a specific property of the material.
The magnitude of this heating eiTect is exemplified by the behavior of a porcelain sample
tested when hot- for example, at 500 0 C. At this temperature, the resistance of a centimeter
cube of ordinary porcelain. is about 100,000 ohms, and if a -v-oltage of only 500 volts per millimeter (i. e., only about one-twentieth of that required to puncture it while cold) be applied,
the current flowing will be 50 milliamperes and 'the power dissipated in the sample will be 250
watts. This will suffice to raise the temperature of the sample at a rate of about 100 0 C. per
second and will cause its rapid destruction.
This heating of the specimen by the measuring current was obser-v-ed on numerous occasions
when making tests at 2,000 and 1,000 -v-olts, and in each case the samples on removal from the
furnace were found to contain one or more spots where the porcelain had been fused into a

and readings were taken only when the current was substantially constant.

In

POLARIZATION.

The early measurements with high voltage direct current show(:)d a number of puzzling
discrepancies, such as a variation of the apparent resistance with the ,oltage used in making
the measurement and with the time of application of this voltage. Plot 7 shows this variation of resIstance with voltage as observed with a porcelain cup specimen. Such discrepancies
indicated the presence of an additional phenomenon to be reckoned with, which in the absence
of definite knowledge as to its origin was called "polarization," and will be so referred to
throughout this report.
The fundamental manifestation of this so-called polarization is that if a constant directcurrent voltage be applied to a specimen, the resulting current will decrease at first rapidly
and then more gradually, as is indicated in plot 8. The reduction in current is often equivalent
to an increase in resistance by a factor of 10 or 20. If the specimen is allowed to remain at a
high temperature but without applied voltage for some time, the effect gradually disappears,
but a considerable time is required to accomplish this. The disappearance js more Hlpi.d at

high temperatures than at low. Plot 9 gives a record of the variation of the apparent
resistance of a glass beaker, as measured with 1,000 volts direct current, after various applications and removals of the measuring potential. The course of the experiment is indicated by
the arrows, and the duration of each period of application or of rest is indicated on the curve.
The lowest and highest curves give the resistance as observed with very short application of
the testing voltage just prior to the polarizing test and on the following day, respectively.
The apparent permanent increase of resistance observed with this specimen serves to explain
some mysterious results obtained at an earlier d~te, in which one specimen had shown an
increase of resistance to more than twenty times its initial value after several successive tes~s.
The fact that an appreciable time is required to obtain a reading, even with quick acting direct
current indicating instruments, and that during this time the specimen is being polarized, is
probably a complete explanation of the variation of apparent resistance with applied voltage,
shown in plot 7. If the applied direct-current voltage is suddenly reversed after a specimen
has become polarized to a considerable extent, the initial current in the new direction is found
to be approximately equal in magnitude to the original current and much greater than the value
immediately preceding the reversal. (See plot 10.) This implies a counter E. M. F., and an
attempt was made to observe such an effect by connecting an electrostatic 'Voltmeter across
the specimen. No residual deflection of this meter was observed when the supply current was
removed, even after long-continued polarization of the specimen. This result is to some extent
in contradiction to facts mentioned by other observers.2
A magneto having alternate distributor points of the same polarity connected together
was also used as a source of voltage and the polarizing effects found to be in every way similar
to those obtained with a steady direct-current source of the same average voltage (150 volts).
When alternating current is applied to a fresh specimen, there is no polarizing effect and
the current remains constant indefinitely, except when the current is so large as to produce
heating of the specimen. When alternating current is applied to a specimen which has been
previously polarized by direct current, the polarization disappears at a more rapid rate than if
the alternating current had not been applied.
An attempt to throw light on these complex phenomena was made by applying alternating
and direct current simultaneously to a specimen. This was accomplished by connecting a
transformer in series with a generator. By opening the primary circuit of the transformer,
or the field of the generator, either source of E. M. F. could be eliminated without opening the
circuit or interfering with the current flow from the other source. The alternating-current
voltage was ro.easmed across the tro,nsformer terminals with a moving iron voltmeter, and the
direct-current voltage by a d'Arsonval type direct-current voltmeter across the generator.
The alternating current through the specimen was passed through the moving coil of an electrodynamometer, the fixed coil of which was excited by an alternating current of constant magnitude and in the same phase as the alternating voltage applied to the specimen. The direct
current through the specimen was measured by a direct-current milliammeter connected in
series with the specimen and the dynamometer. With this arrangement, each pair of instruments measured only its particular component of the resultant current and voltage and was
not affected by the presence of the other component. Plot 11 shows the variation with
time during the course of the experiments of the resistances as computed from the two components of the current. In this experiment the maximum value of the alternating-current
voltage was greater than the direct-current voltage, so that the resultant voltage applied to
the specimen reversed in sign dming each alternation. Other experiments, in which the
maximum alternating voltage was less than the direct-current voltage, and the resultant
voltage was consequently unidirectional, showed substantially the same effects.
Throughout the experiments the temperature was held as nearly constant as possible,
but a gradual drift of resistance will be noticed which can be accounted for by a slight change
of temperature. It appears from these results that the resistance of the specimen is substantially the same for both the alternating and direct current for all states of polarization.
'Maxwell, J. C., Electricity and magnetism, § 271, vol. 1, p. 393, 3d ed.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Or, in other words, the polarization produced by the direct current offers resistance to the
passage of the alternating current and the depolarization produced by the alternating current
reduces the resistance offered to the passage of the direct current.
Wilen alternating current alone was applied to a fresh specimen, the power factor of the
circuit was found to be substantially unity. If, however, the specimen had recently been
polarized by the application of direct current, the power factor was somewhat reduced; values
as low as 0.9 having been observed.
The data described above are quite insufficient for the development of any complete theory
of this polarization, but it would appear that the assumption of a counter E. M. F. is ~'uled out
both by the experiments of combined alternating and direct current and by the difficulty of
imagining a mechanism capable of producing a counter E. M. F. of the order of several thousand
volts, which would be required to produce the observed decrease of current. A possible explanation may be developed on a basis of the migration away from one electrode, of the ions carrying
the current, thus leaving a scarcity of carriers for the further passage of current in the original
direction, but providing a plentiful 'supply for currents in the reversed direction. Another
suggested explanation is the formation of resisting films which may cover a considerable part
of the area of the electrodes but which are readily removed by electrolysis on reversal of the
current. Tests made using platinized surfaces as electrodes instead of the melted solder
showed no difference of behavior. It may be noticed in this connection that when the samples
were removed after cooling, the solidified solder adhered firmly to both surfaces of the cups
which had been treated with direct current, but could be very readily peeled off from specimens
which had been tested on alternating current.
DISCUSSION OF METHODS FOR MEASURING RESISTANCES.

Aa a result of the data obtained in the preliminary experiments just desClibed, it was
decided to adopt a.3 the most satisfactory method for the rapid comparison of different types
of insulating materials the volt-ameter method, using alternating cmrent. Under these conditions the observed reaistance is substantially independent of the frequency, voltage, and time
of application, and the convenient values of 60 cycles and 500 volts were adopted for the later
work. Plot 6 shows typical reoults obtained by this method and indicates the agreement
attainable on successive runs even at different voltages. It should be remembered, however,
that the results thus obtained are for the material in the unpolarized state, and, when in actual
use in ignition systeID3, the material may show a much higher resistance to the unidirectional
.
impulse from the magneto.
Of other possible methods for such work, a bridge method ming direct current would be
objectionable because of the variable amount of polarization which would occur. Attempts
were made to use alternating current as a source, but the meaSUlements are complicated .b y the
effect of stray capacities shunting the high resistance which are necessary, and the time
required to obtain a balance on the bridge is a serious drawback because of the rapid change
in the resistances to be measured with even slight drifts of temperature.
The megger, while extremely rapid and convenient, is open to the disadvantages of polarizatitm and to the fact that the voltage supplied varies very considerably with the resistance of
the .3pecimen under test.
The use of a magneto in place of alternating CUTrent as a SOUTce has the great advantage
that it approximately duplicates the conditions of operation in the engine. The magneto,
however, is very variable in its ouput, both from instant to instant and as a result of permanent
changes in the magnets, contact points, etc. Moreover, there is an abrupt change in the
operation of the machine when the resistance of the specimen becomes so low as to cause the
spark in the safety gap to cease, and also the total variation of the CUlTent delivered with various
resistances in the circuit is comparatively slight with this type of machine.
A method involving the measurement of the rate of loss of charge from a condenser
connected in parallel with the specimen has been used by Cunningham. This method imitates
the conditions of operation much more closely than does the alternating current method, but

not as perfectly as the use of a magneto as a somce. The principal objections are the very
delicate string electrometer which i required and tho necessity of recording the results
photographically.
TYPICAL RESULTS AND CONCLUSION.

The following table gives the results obtained by the u e of the alternating current method
on a number of types of samples, the significance of the various constants being the same as
those defined previously.

. The e figure show a wide variation in the resistance of the dillerent materials but a rather
smprising similarity in the constant h, which is a measme of the temperature coefficient of their
re i tance. It should be mentioned in this connection that while successive mea urement
with alternating current on a single specimen give re ults repeating to a few per cent, yet
measurements on different specimens of material which are supposed to be identical show wide
variations in resistivity, amounting in some cases to a factor of 10. This fact tends to indicate
that the conduction is due to a considerable extent to the presence of small amounts of
ecting the composition
impurities whIch may vary greatly in amount without appreciably afi1
of the material as a whole.
It appears from the above data that the alternating current method developed is very
practical and convenient for comparative measurements on samples of this character, but
there is a very wide field of investigation concerning the phenomenon of polarization and much
interesting work may be done in developing theories as to the precise mechanism by which
conduction is calTied on in this class of materials.

ELECTRICAL RESlSTANCE OF VARIOUS INSULATING MATERIALS AT lllGH

RESUME.

In very hot high-compression engines spark plugs may fail because the core becomes a conductor of electricity. The ignition current then flows through the body of the plug instead of
causing a spark at the terminals'. The data given in this report show the characteristics of
various porcelains and other materials in this respect. These data include values for a large
number of plugs now on the market and also various experimental porcelains produced in the
laboratory and covering a wide variety of compositions.
To secure definite and repeatable results on this property, it was found necessary to make the
measurements with alternating current, using a 500-volt, 50-cycle supply. In this way the disturbing effect of polarization, etc., is avoided. The conductivity of this class of materials increases very rapidly with temperature according to the law of compound interest at a rate of about
2 per cent per degree centigrade.
The most convenient basis of comparison for different materials is the CI effective temperature" (Te) to which they must be heated in order to reduce their resistivity to a definite vulue. This
value is arbitrarily taken as one megohm per cm. cube. A spark plug of normn.l design with
material of this resistivity would have a resistance of about 200,000 ohms. This value is only
slightly above the limit at which the usual ignition system can be counted on to fire a. plug. The
effective temperature thus defined varies from 870 0 C. in case of fused quartz (the best material
tested) down to 280 0 C. for some kinds of glass. Porcelains have been developed at the Bureau
of Standards ceramic laboratory which have an effective temperature as hi.gh as 800 0 C. Certain
bodies recently developed for use in aviation engines have temperatures of about 650 0 C., while
the majority of spark-plug porcelains have 500 0 C. A material having Te less than 400 0 C. should
be used only when the design of the plug is such that the insulator is extremely well cooled.
INTRODUCTION.

The measurements described below form a part of the investiga tion of spark plugs undertaken
by the Bureau of Standards. A number of cases were reported of spark-plug failures which occurred under conditions suggesting that the insulating material had become conducting at the
high temperatures existing in aviation engines, and an extensive study of this phenomenon in
various insulating materials was undertaken. Later information combined with data accumulated in the laboratory indicates that this cause of spark-plug failure is not as common as was a.t
first thought, but may occur in very hot engines. rfhe suitability of a material for use in spark
plugs should therefore not be judged solely on its insulation resistance while hot.
The ceramic laboratory of the bureau, in connection with this worle, undertook to develop an
improved type of porcelain which should be more satisfactory for use in spark plugs. As a basis
for this a large number of samples of porceln.ins of various composition were made up so as to
obtain data over as wide a field as possible, with the idea of correlating the physical properties
of porcelains with their compositions and heat treatment and of obtaining data of value for
many lines of work. The ceramic side of this undertaking is described in Part III of this
report.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The early measUTements of electrical conductivity, which were made with direct current,
showed the existence of very complex phenomena, such as polarization, etc., and it was found
necessary to develop an alternating-cUTrent method for testing the specimens. The various
phenomena observed during the development of this method ·are discussed in detail in Part I
of this report, and in what follows only the method finally adopted and the results obtained by
it will be given.
METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.

The specimen of insulating material to be tested is heated in an electric furnace to the desired
temperatUTe. Sixty-cycle alternating current at 500 volts is impressed upon the specimen between two suitable electrodes. A voltmeter connected between these electrodes and an ammeter·
in series with the specimen are read simultaneously and the quotient of effective vultage divided
by effect.ive current is taken as the resistance.
Since the current through the specimen is rather small, a very sensitive milliammeter is required and in most of the work it is found most convenient to use for this purpose a dynamometer
wattmeter. The fixed coil of this wattmeter is excited by a known CUTrent from the same SOUTce
of supply as the test; current through the specimen. The moving coil of the wattmeter is conuch an arrangement provides a higher sensitivity than can

which can be measured by using various exciting cunents. The connections used in this test

MeasUTements made by this method on the same sample are fourid to give results agreeing
to a few per cent when different voltages, frequencies, and times of application of the measuring
current are used . This method has been adopted by the BUTeau of Aircraft Production and is
recommended in their specification No.2 ,017.
Two typps of test specimen have been used in this work. For the accUTate measUTement
of the conductivity of the material, a cup specimen, similar to the American ociety for Testing
Materials, standard test piece No . 1, is very convenient, though it is not essential that the side
walls of the cup be tapered. Figure 2 gives a cross section of this type of specimen.
The test cup is filled to a depth of about 2 cm. (0. inch) with melted solder, which forms one
electrode, and is in turn set in a slightly larger shallow steel cup containing melted solder, which
for ms the other electrode. This arrangement insures good contact between the electrodes and
the porcelain. To avoid cracking the cup it is, of COUTse, necessary to insert the solder in the
solid form and melt it by gradually increasing the furnace temperature. Figure 3 shows the
arrangement of the cup specimen in the furnace. Two thermocouples. protected by porcelain
tubes are inserted in the solder in the test specimen and in a hole in the steel cup, respectively.
Measurements of resistivity are made only when these two couples indicate substantially the
same temperatUTe.
In cases where cup specimens are not available, actual spark plug insulators are tested,
using the central electrode as one terminal and the shell of the spark plug I\S the other. In cases
where the insulator is removed from the shell, a band about 2 cm. (0. inch) wide at the center
of the length of the insulator waB coated with platinum by painting it with a solution of platinic
chloride (PtCl 4 ) in oil of Cloves and then heating the deposit to reduce the chloride to metallic
platinum. This platinum belt is used as the outer terminal, and makes good contact with the
insulator. The specimen is then inserted, as shown in figure 4, in an electric furnace, in which
the temperature is indicated by a thermocouple placed in contact with the shell of the plug.
MeasUTements obtained on these plug specimens are accUTate as indicating the resistance
of the specimen, but owing to the irregular shape and the uncertainty as to the area of outer
electrode in actual contact with the porcelain they are not suitable for accUTately measUTing
the resistivity of the material. We have, however, computed, from the usual formula 1 for

current flow between concentric cylinders, the factor K, by which the resistance must be multiplied to give the resistivity of the material, and from this factor have computed the resistivities
of the plugs, which are given in Tables IV and V. In this computation it has been assumed
that contact was made over the entire surface covered by the shell of the plug, and consequently
the value of resistivity computed on this basis arc too high if this contact be imperfect. It
should also blJ noted that the path for surface leakage i much shorter in the case of the plug
specimen, and also that if the gln.ze is of poorer material than the body conduction through
this glaze will reduce the apparent resistivity. In the cup specimen, on the other hand, the
area of contact and thickness of the bottom of the cup are definite and easily measured, and
any po sible leakage path is very long.
COMPUTATION OF RESULTS.

The change of resi tivity with temperature for the class of materials tested is so rapid
that it is impracticable to plot resistivity vs. temperature directly, as a scale which is suitable
at one end of the temperatlU'e range becomes extremely crowded at the other. It has been
found, however, that by plotting the logarithm of the resistivity against the temperatme a
smooth ClU've slightly concave upward is obtained. The ClU'vature of this plot is quite small,
and the data can be represented within the range of temperatures used with sufficient accuracy
by a straight line 1 which most nearly fits the observed point. Plot 5 hows a typical ClU've
obtained on a cup specimen and also shows the agreement to be expected on repeating the
observations on the same sample even at different voltages.
The points on the straight line give the relation
(1)

where R is the resistance of the specimen in ohms and t the temperature in degrees Centigracle,
while a and b are constants of the curve. Introducing the factor f{ mentioned above, we obtain
Log,Op = a + log,o [{ -b t = c -bi

(2)

where p is the resistivity in ohm per centimeter cube and c a new constant of the material
which is obtained from a by the equation
(3)

c and b depend upon the material only and not upon the shape or size of the particular specimen,
and from a knowledge of these constants p can be computed for any temperature by equation (2). Unfortunately neither c nor b is very convenient as a figlU'e of merit for the material,
ince a slight error in either will greatly affect the value of the other. We have, therefore,
found it advantageous to compute for each material p 500' which is the resistivity of the material
at .500 0 C. Another still more convenient figure of merit is the temperature at which the material
has the definite resistivity of one megohm per centimeter cube.
This can be computed by the equation

_c-6
T c- b
This value is given in the following tables for each material, and is the most satisfactory criterion
of its value as an insulator at high temperatlU'es.
A physical interpretation of the fact that the results when plotted logarithmically give a
straight line can be obtained by considering that the conductivity increases with temperature,
according to the law of compound interest, at a rate of about 2 per cent (2.3b) per degree
Centigrade. 'rhe cumulative effect of the compounding is such that an increase in temperature
of 100 0 corresponds in the average material to an increase in the conductivity of 600 per cent.
1.\ sligh t error is theoretically introduced by iltis method or representing the results, siuce the poorer materials are tested at lower temperatures, where the curve is steeper. Tbis is entirely negligible ror the pllrposes ror which t he results are to be used.

TABLES.

The results of the measurements are given in the tables below. In each table the first
column contains a description of the material, the second column gives a number arbitrarily
assigned to the specimen for laboratory references, and the remaining columns the value of
the constants b, c, Te, etc., defined in the preceding section.
Table 1 gives the results on the experimental porcelains made up in the ceramic laboratory of
the bureau. The composition, heat treatment, etc., corresponding to each of these specimens,
is given in Tables 6 and 7.
Table :2 gives similar data on cup specimf'ns which have been submitted by various porcelain manufacturers in connection with their (levelopment work.
Table :i gives results on various other materials which were obtained in the form of cr~l­
cibles, tubing, etc., by the laboratory.
Tables 4 and ,5 contain the results on American and foreign spark plugs, respecti vely.
Table G gives the compositions and firing temperatures (in terms of Or Lon's pyromeLl'i'
cones) of the various materials listed in 'rahle ] . The various calcines mentioned in this table
arc described in Table 7.
The numerical values in the tables are in each case the average of the results of all the
samples tested of the same material, but in many cases only one sample was tested. Unfortunately, the variation in Te observed in different specimens 01 what was supposed to be the
same material sometimes amounts to as much as 50 ° C, and this variation should be borne in
mind in comparing the results on different mat')rials.
It should also be noted that where both cup and plug samples of nominally the same material were tested the latter usually showed decidedly lower resistance. Three explanations fo1'
this may be suggested:
First. The material is made up by a somewhat different process, the cup specimens being
molded under slight pressure while the plugs are extruded through a die.
Second . Surface leakage and con Iuction through the glaze may have been present in the
plug specimens and not in the cups.
Third. The cup specimens being especially prepared for test, may have been made up with
greater care than the plugs.
CONCLUSIONS.

The following conclusions seem evident from the data given in the tables,
Quartz is by far the best of the materials testecl as far as resistance at high temp era Lure is
concerned, alth ugh several of Lhe laborat.ory porcelain bodies, such as 77 and 7 ,approach this
fairly closely. The mica plugs show fairly high resistivity, but it should be noted also that Lhis
material loses its water of crystallization at temperatures approaching 1,000° . and becomes
very soft and friable.
.
Several of the porcelains recenny developed in this cOlmtry for aviation work are very
notably superior to the majority of the porcelains tested .
The steatite and Rajah porcelains from Germany are not notably high in resisLivity, and
therefore the very high reputation as spark plug insulators which these materials had before the
war was apparently not due to their resistivity. The French porcelains are on the whole not as
good as the more recent American bodies. This may account for the preference for mica plugs
shown in the former country.

PORCELAINS FOR SPARK PLUGS.

The average co mmel'cinl porcelain does not fulfill the conditions required for spark-plug
servicc, nor for any other conditions where hi.gh-tensi.on CUlTents are employed, and the temperature is considerably above atmospheric conditions. From the standpoint of the electrical
resistance at the temperatures reached in airplane engines, the feldspathic porcelains begin to
break down nt a l'Clte rapidly increasing with temperature, due to electrolytic effects. Tills is
indica ted also by the polarization willch is observed in using direct cw:rent. The leakage thus
taking place may become a serious factor .

REPLACEMENT OF FELDSPAR.

pon comparing the Te value§ of the different porcelains it was noted that there exists
no definite relation between the composition and the elC'ctrical conductivity. On the other
hand, the higher the rna turing tempera t1U'es of the porcelains, the higher was the Te value.
This is practicall~' equiyalent to sasing that, roughly speaking, the electrical resistance at
higher temperatures is the QTeclier the lower the feldspar content, s ince small amounts of this
flux make it neccssary to calTY the porcelain to H higher burning tempera tUl'e. The relation,
however, is not well defined, as mny be observed from the resu lts compiled in the fol1owing table:

It i quite evident that the micro-structurc of the porcelains is an important facto)' in this
connection, ince it can not be immaterial how much kaolin 01' quartz has been dissolved by
lhe fused feldspar and how much sillimanitc has been formed. The evidence, however, was
considered sufficient to wal'l'ant the replacement of the feldspars by other fluxes, the oxides of
magne ium and beryllium being u ed fOJ ' this purpose,
Owing to the e\-olution of carbon dioxide during the firing proce from magne ite. and
the artificially prepared ba ic magnesium cat'bonate, and the very large hl'inkage accompanying their usc as a flux, iL was decided Lo introduce. the magne ia in the form of a calcine;
that i, a silicate mixture pre\' iou 1y firod to a point close to ,itl'incation. The mL'i:tures employed for this pUt'pORe cOlTespond to the formula: ~lg0 Al z0 3 2 i0 2 ; 1JgO Al z0 3 4SiO z, and
:\10-0 Al zO.1 6 iO z' Of thoso, t be first and the Rccond wero mo t u' ed in thi work. The preparation of the calcines con. isted in dry bal1 mill grinding and firing the mL'i:ture made up into
balls with just ufflCient water. After calcinaLion, the material was cru 'hed and ground and
introduced into the bodies in this form. The beryllium oxide wa. brought in through the use
of the mineral beryl (which has the genera] composition HBeO AlzO a 6Si02 ) "rithout any previous
treatment.
With the use of magnesia as Lhe principal flux, th e eleclrical re' i tance and hence the
value T e, wa found to increase quite decidedly, t.hough with no well-clefinecll'egulal'ity a referred
to pcrcentage contcnl of magnesia. It was seen again in this connection, t.hat the structure of
the porcelain pla~-s an impol'tallt part especially ns it. i~ known t.hat :MgO accelerates the cr'ystallization of 'lillimnni({' most ,-igorously. ~ ol only the number buL also the , ize of the sillimanite crystals is of significance in determining the texture of the body, wheLher it is to be fine
grained, gla sy, or con.rs e l~- crystalline. The] ale of cooling t.be porcelain i ' likewi e of importance, since a rapid drop in temperature illyal'inbl~- caus('s the structure to be closer and of more
vitreous charadeI' than ,,-hen a longer time is taken in cooling down the kiln. For this reason
smaller kilns are to bl' prefeneu to largcr on('s, since they require les time in eooling at a
given raLe. The elrect of magnesia addecl in the form of s}'nt.hetic silicate, i trikingly shown
by the high T. yalues of bodie. 1. J 0 . 77 and 7. See Table IY.
It is a fact thaL th(' llJllgnesium silicates 8ho'" electrolytic eireM which are much less

It likewise appears that the higher the firing temperature of the porcelain the greater its electrical resi tance , a L temperatures up to 700° C. , or ::;omewhat above this point.
With refel'encc Lo th(' usc of beryllium oxide it W,1S found that this Jlux behaves imilarly
to the magne::;ia in showing high electrical resist.ance ,mel 1'e ,alues. This is indicated by the

It is evident from these results that beryllium oxide, used in the form of the mineral beryl,
is a valuable filL,{ from the standpoint here under consideration . It requires, however, careful
temperature control in firing, since the beryllium porcelain is subject to sudden deformation
a'> Lhe vitrificaLion temperature is exceeded. The experiments have proven that beryllium
oxide is ,,'or thy of con idel'ation fo), the production of such porcelain, and the high T. value

UAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

REPLACEMENT OF QUARTZ.
I

From a general study of porcelain, it appears desirable to eliminate the quartz, as has been
pointed out in u. previous paragraph. Some of the materials available for this purpose are
calcined kaolin, synthetically prepared sillimanite (A1 20 3 Si02 ), and sintel'ed or fu ed alumina
and zirconium oxide. These substances have been introduced in a number of compositions.
The effect of adding calcined kaolin in general wa beneficial; and even with a feld par content
of 13.5 per cent (body No. 63 ), a fair Te value, 540, was obtained. rrhis particular composition
contained 50 per cent raw kaolin, 13.5' per cent feldspar, l.5 per cent calcium carbonate, and
35 per cent calcined kaolin. The maturing temperature of this porcelain was that corresponding to cone No. 16. It i e,Tident that by rai ing the content of calcined kaolin still more at.
the expen e of the feld par a higher Te YRlue would be obtained. The introduction of plastic
ball clay to replace kaolin, invariabl~T and in all types of bodie, reduces the electrical resistance
within the temperature range here under consideration.
The use of fused alumina in any exten ive work was prohibited by the lack of maLeriallow
in iron content. The commercial ubstance (alundum) is unsuited for this purpose. The total
amount of white fu ed alumina, anlilable was not more than 2 pounds. To bring about the
necessary impervious and dense structure the use of 17.6 pcr cent of feld pal' was required. A
mLxture consisting of 4.') per cent kaolin, 17.6 per cenl feld 'par, 4.4 per cent calcine No. 13,
and 33 per cent of alundum, resulted in a, very tough porcelain "Yhich howed a Te value of 620.
Calcine r o. 13 was compounded acc()l"(ling to the formula 11g0 \.12 3 2 i0 2 from 4 parts, by
0
weight, of magnesium carbon ate and 25 of ph, tic kaolin from Florida ancl Georgia. Here
again the reduction of tbe feldspar content and its replacement by calcine No. 13, or beryl, or
a combination of the e two would be certain to raise the To value considerably and at the arne
time would result in a porcelain of excell('nt mechanical properties. The co t of the fused
white alumina would be quite high, but would be justified Uliller the circulllstance. Furthermore, a single calcine could be readily produced by combining the rmv mtttel'ial of calcine
o. 13, the kaolin and magne ita, with uncalcined alumina from any convenient source, and
firing the mixture to a point of constant volume, which ('ou ld be accomplisheclat temperatures
not exceeding cone No.1. At the same time this procedure would simplify the proce s of
preparation very considerably.
Sillimanite (A1 20 3 2 ) is a normal component of all hard fired porcelain: and this conSi0
stituent, if not present in the form of large crystals, impart to the materilll constancy in
volume upon heating, lower the thermal expansion, increases the refractorine ,and the resistance to sudden heating and cooling. For this reason it "as thought desirable to produce
the mineral synthetically and to introduce it in the porcelain composition in place of the
quartz. This was done by combining 70.20 per cent of plastic kaolin, 27. 0 of anhydrou
alumina, and 2 per cent of boric Rcid. After grinding this mixture in the dry state in a ball mill,
it 'was made up with water to form a plastic ma. '': \"hich was molded into balls calcined to a
temperature corre3ponding to that of conc ITO . 20, or approximately 1,530° C. At this temperature the ma s sintered to .1 dense structure, subject to but little additional shrinkage
and containing only a maJl amount of uncombined alumina. The boric acid \Va added to
assist in bringing about the necessary hrinkage and closing up of the pores, and it is quite
probable that most of this constiLllent is yolatiliz(;'d at the fiual temperature of the calcination.
Thi calcine (No. 19) was then cru.'hcd separately, pa sed over H magnetic;..eparator, and then
ground, together with Lhe other material ' of the body with the addition of water in the ball mill.
In preparing tbi. type of body the feldspar was el iminatr d on thc basis of the re:mlt.. discu sed
abov~, and replaced by a calcine corresponding to the formula :LIJgO Alz0s 4SiO z (No. 14) .
This porcelain (No. 152) wa. compos(;'d of 30 per cent of kaolin, 10 per cent of ball clay, 40 per
cent of sillimanite calcine, and 20 per ccnt of fluxing calcine No. ] 4, and fi!'c d to a temperature
of cone No. 16 or higher. The re ultanL material had excellent mechanical qualitie and an
average Te value of 690. The structure of this' body should be fine and dense, a condition
which requires quite rapid cooling of the kiln. Slower cooling re ults in the formation of coarser
sillimanite crystals which cause a structure much less resistant to sudden heating and cooling .

PROPERTIES AND PREPARATION OF CERAMIC INSULATORS FOR SPARK PLUGS .

105

The preparation of this body may be simplified by the combination of the two calcines into
one, thus, by employing the composition of the flux No. 13 (MgO AlzOs 2SiO z) the combined
calcine would be composed of 75.]0 pel' cent plastic kaolin, 8.77 pel' cent magnesite, and 16.13
pel' cent anhydrous alumina. The boric acid content has been eliminated. Body o. 152
would then consist of 30 pel' cent of kaolin, 10 per cent of ball clay, and 60 per cent of the combined calcine. Wherever the working condition permit the ball clay should be eliminated,
and an effort made to employ the body containing 40 pel' cent of plastic kaolin, which can
usually be done by allowing the mixture to age before molding it.
The tendency of the body to crystallize may be diminished also by replacing the fluxing
calcine in part by beryl, so that these two components are present in the ratio of 1:1. If, then,
the combined fluxing and sillimanite calcine is employed, the resultant composition would be
kaolin, 60.94 pel' cent; anhydrou alumina, 18.39 pel' cent; boric acid, 1.32 pel' cent; magnesite,
4.58 pel' cent; beryl, 14.7 pel' cenL. The body, as before, would consist of 60 per cent of this
calcine and 40 per cent of kaolin. The fu ion point of this mixture is so low that it would be
quite possible to eliminate the boric acid entirely. At the same. time the vitrification point of
the body is lower and closer to the normal kiln temperatures.
.
Attention might be called to the fact that the use of a siliceous porcelain i not objectionable
hom the electrical standpoint but only from consideration of the mechanical strength, resistance to . udden tempel'aLUl'e ehanges, et. This i ' hown by the )'e ult upon high silica porcelains, bodies Nos. 1] 6 and 119, which show a very high 1'e value, namely 730. This type of porcelain contains 50 per cent of clay, 30 pel' cent of free quartz (flint), and 20 per cent of magnesia
calcine. In No. 116, the calcine corresponds to the formula MgO A120 a 28i02 , and in No. 119
to MgO AlzO a 48i0 2 . It is fair to state those porcelain would give excellent results, considered
from the dielectric standpoint, when used uncleI' conditions not so extreme 'with reference to
temperature and shock as is the case with spark plugs used in airplane engines .
Zirconium oxide was used only in Lwo porcelain:;, clue to the cOlllparatively limited supply
available. The material at hand wa zircon which contained 52.74 per cent of ZrO z and 43.46
per cent of silica. As received, the mineral was high in iron, which, however, was eliminated
by treatment with chlorine at a temperatme of 00 ° C. In this manner all but a trace of the
iron w~\s removed. Owing to the l'act that the e zircon porcelains were produced comparatively
early in the work, feldspar was employed as the flux. The result was that the electrical resistance, and hence the 1'e value, was low, being 500 and 450, respectively. With the use of the magne::;ia or beryllium fluxes much better products could undoubtedly be produced. The mechanical strength of the::;e porcelains was excellent in every respect. The compo ition of ~hese bodies,
Nos. 72 and 73, is given in Table IV.
The effect of the quartz in porcelain upon the thermal expansion of the body is shown by
the results compiled in Table III.

It is at once evident from a comparison of these figures that the thermal expansion of these
magnesia porcelains increases with the silica content of the body, and, at the same time, is
subject to decided variation within the temperature limits of 30°-550° C. On the other hand
the porcelain in which the clay content is lower, and all the quartz has been replaced by sillimanite, shows both the lowe t thermal expan ion and the least variation in the value of the
coefficient. However, the composition is not the only determining factor, and the importance
of the microstructure must be realized.

CONCLUSIONS.

The work, t he results of which have been given, ha been ucce sful in howing: First, t he
injurious qualities imparted to electrical porcelain by the use of feldspar a a flux; and seco nd .
in bringing ou t the de irability of replacing tho quartz by mineral or synthetically prepared
materials which are more constant in -volume when heated. The remedial procedures advocated
are, hence: (1) T he repl acement of feldspar by other lluxe , such a ilicatcs of the type
MgO AlzOa 2 iO z, or MgO Al 20 3 4 iO z• or other . ilicate of beryllium and tho alkaline earLhs.
either n atural or prepared artificially. (2) The elimination of quartz and the substitution of
ubst ance not subject to inversions or other volume changes. These may be highly calcined
kaolin, alumina, zircon, or sillimanite, either natural or produced ynthetically.
The compositions of the most typical porcelain produced in this work are compiled in
T able IV, V, and VI, and the T. value is gi-ven for each body. 0 that the e tabulations may be
consulted for detailed information.

PART IV.

CEMENTS FOR SPARK-PL G ·ELECTRODES. ·
By II. F.

STALEY.

RESUME.

Considerable trouble has been caused in airplane engine work through the breaking of the
central electrode of spark plugs.
An investigation of this problem by the Bureau of tandards shows that in many cases the
cement used to hold the nickel electrode wire in the porcelain is of such a nature that it rapidly
eats away the wire through oxidization, when exposed to the high temperature of the engine
cylinder. A cement composed of silicate of soda and raw kaolin has been found to give the least
trouble in this respect.
In cases where the cement holds the wire firmly in the porcelain the latter often cracks when
ubj ected to heat due to the difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the wire and
the porcelain. The breaking of the porcelain docs not seem to be due to leaky spark plugs as
has often been supposed to be the ca.se.
On account of the difficulties attending the use of any form of cement between the porcelain
and central electrode, the elimination of the cement and the use of a mechanical seal at the top
of the porcelain is greatly to be desired. In such a plug only a porcelain strong enough to safely
with tand the resulting stresses should be used. The porcelain recently developed by the
Bureau of Standards is believed to meet these requirements.
CEMENTS FOR SPARIC-PLUG ELECTRODES .

Considerable trouble has been experienced in the operation of airplane engines due to
breaking of the central electrode wires in spark plugs at the point where they enter the porcelain .
Examination of numerous broken spark plugs showed that at the point of failure the central
electrode wire was oxidized practically through its cross section, this oxidization extending up
into the spark plug a variable distance, depending upon the permeability of the cement with
which the wire was surrounded. In some cases the cement had melted and run down along the
wire. It was apparent from the nature of the failures that in order to thoroughly study the problem, the composition of the electrode wire, porcelain insulator and the cement used to secure
the wire to the insulator, must be investigated.
The material in common use for central electrodes in the spark plugs bought by the Government for airplane service is known as "97 per cent spark point nickel wire." The following
are typical analyses:

In the case of the cements used between the wire and porcelain, it developed that mo t of
the e consisted of a mixture of ilicate of soda with fmely powrlered solid , which were suppo ed
to be chemically inert. Barium sulphate was the solid u ed by the manufacturer whose plugs
ga,e the most trouble, while another maker, who e plugs are used in large quantities for airpl ane work, employed finely ground ilica. Silicate of soda cements are advantageous for this
work becau e they are cheap, can be "orked cold, and are gas tight at low temperatures.
To determine the effect of various cements on electrode wU'es, mixtures were made of
silicate of soda and typical powdered materials. Small pellets of the e mi..xtures were ,yorked
around commercial nickel electrode wire and after drying at 120 0 C., the wires and adhering
pellets were heated in an oxidizing atmosphere to 1,000 0 C., which approximate the temperature at the tip of the porcelain in an au'plane engine in operation. After cooling, the pellets
were broken off and the wire beneath them examined. The results are given in Table 1.
From Table I, it appeal'S that the solids used do not act simply a inert material. In the
second case in this table, for instance, the reaction probably is as follows:
N a2 0· Si0 2 +BaSO{ =

T

a2SO{ +BaO· Si02 •

The reaction in the other cases are too problematical to be worth di cus ion here. It is
sufficient to say that raw kaolin was found to he the best solid for u e in spark plug cements
since it absorbed the sodium silicate as fast as it melted and produced an impervious mass.
The oxidation is greatly accelerated by contact with fused alkaline substances.
Attempts were made to seal the wires into the porcelain after heating by means of glasses
ranging in coefficient of thermal expansion from that of the porcelain to that of the wire.
None of these attempts have so far been succe sful, for in cooling, the glass pulled away either
from the porcelain or from the wire. Special wire, with a coefficient of thermal expan ion
about equal to that of porcelain, ha been ordered. The e expenments will then be repeated.
As a part of this investigation, a visit was made hy a representative of the bureau to a
spark plug factory where all porcelau1l were. ubjected to a sudden heating test, in which the
tip of the porcelain wa placed in the flame of a Meker burner. The porcelains were uniformly
passing this test. When it was sugge ted that porcelains containing electrodes be tested in
the same manner, it was found that 45 per cent of the porcelains cracked. As the result of
actual enCYine t.est" of complete plug at the bureau, it has been found in general that in the
cracked plug the cement is holding well, the failure being due to the difference in coefficient of
thermal expansion between the porcelain and nickel wire, \vhich ets up so high a stre s between
the two parts of the plug that one or the other ha to give way. This conclusion is collin-med
by the fact that in the above factory te ts, on the 55 per cent of plugs that did not fail, either
cement was absent from around the wire ncar the tip of the porcelain or else it softened and
gu hed out of the hole.

PROPERTIES AND PREPARATION OF CERAMIC INSULATORS FOR SPARK PLUGS .

III

The subjecL of gas leakage of spark plug' in relaLion to failure of Lhe cent.ral electrode has
al 0 heen studied. While considerable work has been done in . det.ermining the gas leakage of
new plugs in view of the above results, it appeared advi. able to Jetel'minE\ leakage on plugs
that had been used in an airplane engine. In Tahle 2 are given the results of examinalion of, a
typical lo t of 10 plug. The following information will be of a. si tanee in reading this t.able.
Of the 12 broken plugs, 6 leaked bacily and 6 diclllOt leak at all. Of t.hose that leaked ba(ily,
4 eonLained loose wires and, in the case of one of these, the wire could be pulled ou t easily .
It is cyident thi1t tests for gas leaka.ge on llew plugs giye no indication of their gas leakage in use
and that this leakage does not necessarily produce broken porcelains. .
In conclusion it may be staLed that on account of the difficulties incident to the use of cement
between the electrode wires and porcelains in spark plugs, t.he elimination of the cement entirely
and the use of a mechanical seal at the top of the porcelain is greatly to be desired. The
mechanical stress incident to the use of such seals should be localized at the top of the plug.
The type of l)Orcrlain develored by the bureau has suITkient strength t.o withstand the necessary
stresses. At least two manufacturers of spark plugs arc follo"illg up the sugge_tiOll of the
hill'eau along this line and tests of these plugs are to be carried out a soon us sumples arc received.

R£SUM:E.

The investigation described in this report was conducted at the Bureau of Standards for
the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics .
The spark discharge used to fire an internal combustion engine must pass through the
compre' ed and heated mixture which occupie the engine cylinder n ear the end of the compres ion troke. The object of the experiments described in this report was to' determine
how the voltage n ecessary to produce such a spark discharge varies with the pre sure and
temperature of the gas. The results are of value in showin a what voltage an ignition sys tem
is required to deliver in order to produce a spark and in enabling one to set up in the labor atory
a convenient experimental gap electrically equivalent to that in the engine cylinder.
Measurements were made on park plugs screwed into a bomb containing compre ~ ed air,
and inserted in an eleetric fUl;nace '0 that both pressUl e and temperature could be varied as
de.sired. The sparking voltages were mea ured on fow plugs, having different electr ode,:;, at
pressure up to 100 pounds per square inch and temperatures up to 500 0 C. Both 50-cycle
alternating current and current obtained from a magneto were used. The observed voltagea
arc plotted against pres ure in plots 2, 3, 4, and 7, and again t density in plot 5.
The results show that the sparking voltage i.5 a linear function of the density of the ga3 and
depend upon pre ure and temperature only as they afl'ect the deruity, i. e., heating a gas at
constant volume does not afl'ect the sparking voltage. For a typical spark plug gap set at
0.5 mm. (0.020 inch) the sparking voltage was found to be 2,800 volts at atmospheric density
and 9,400 volts at a density five times as great.
The data given in this report were obtained on ail' only . The 1 esul t of mea UI ements made
elsewhere indicate that the sparking voltage in an explosive mixture of gasoline and air ia about
10 pel' cent less than in pure air, and that the change in voltage is proportional to the amount
of gasoline presen t.
INTRODUCTION.

This report de cribes some experiments ,made to determine the change of spark potential
with pres ure and temperature, in order to determine the nece sary minimum potential for
causing sparks to pa s in a gasoline engine whose compre sion ratio was known and in which
the temperature of the gase before ignition could be estimated.
According to the simple theory (J. J. Thomson, Conduction of E lectricity through Gases;
Townsend, Electricity in Gase ; and Peek, Tl'l1nsactions of the American Institute of E lectrical
Engineers, 1910- 1916) the sparking potential depends solely on the denaity of the gas between
the electrodes for a given fixed pair of electrode, i. e., on the total number of molecule between
the electrodes. This has been investigated over a con iderable range of pr essure.;:, spark distances, and forma of electrode by numl?rous observers, but only three investigators have
studi ed the effect of temperature, and then only over a limited range. They aU found that the
sparkin!?; potential depended soleiy on the dC'nsity of the ga over the range studied .
In the study of illl'plane park plugs it seemed advisable to determine whethej' th i law held
for pre;:;smes and temperatmcs which might occm in the cylinder" of n high compression engine

just before the ignition of the charge. In airplane engine the maXLDlUm compression
pressures under normal conditions range from 90 to 130 pounds per square inch with temperaturE's
up to 300" C.
APPARATUS.

The experiments were conducted as follows: An ordinary i-inch Titan A. C. porcelain
plug wa' screwed into a steel bomb about 25 cm. (10 inche~) lon er, having the design
indicated in figme 1. There wa a thick gla window opposite the ~ parkjng terminal wheu
the plug was screwed in position. A high-pre:; me air tnnk connected to the bomb throuerh
suitahle alve s!:'rved to regulate the air pres. ure to any desired value. TemperatUIes w're
measured by aPt, Pt-Rh thermocouple, B. S. W5, which wa inserted in a teel tube ealed at
one end with walls t mm. (0 .020 inch) thick. This wa screwed into the bomb 0 that it
inner end was within 1 cm. ot the parkin o. terminals of the plug. The bomb waR placed in
a cylindrical electric res i~tance fmnac!:' and packed with asbe ' to WOOl, SO that only thr. porc lain
insulatol was expo ed at one end, while the window projected out about 5 cm. (2 inches) heyond
the other end.
Sixty-cycle voltage was upplied through a step-up trans[ol'mf'r having a ratio of 200: 1
and applied between the central electr de and the bomb. A re' i tance of 220,000 ohm was
put in sel ies with the plug to avoid an exce ive cmrent and consequent bmning of the terminal
when the park pa sed. The voltage was read on a voltmeter connected to the low-ten~ ion ide
of an auxiliary step-down tran formel. The pa ago of the park was made evident both by
the kiek of the voltmeter and by the appearance of the spark in the bomb. Ionization was
provided for by the use of a half milligram ample of radium in mo t of the experiments, while
in some fl, 50-mgm. sample, placed ju t below the electric fUlnace, wa~ alo used. This ionization
served to eliminate the complicating effect of spark c: lag" and m,tde the readings much more
0 striking dillerence in the readings could be noticed with the two

The te.:;ts were run on three Titan plugs: o. 1 had the regular terminals of i-Mn wire
1.3 mm. (0.05 ] inch) in diameter et at rierht angles and epara ted by 1. ffiffi. (0 .071 inch);
o. 2 W:1S a Titan plug with similar terminals 2.13 mm. (0 .123 inch) in diameter rounded at the
ends, e arated by 1.2 ffiffi. (0.047 inch); o. 3 wa a plug like o. 1 but with a distance of 2.2
ffiffi. (0 .0 6 inch) between the wire.
In ea h ca e the park pa . ed between the cylindrical
surfaces of the wire near the point of clo cst proximity.
PROCEDURE.

The readings were taken as follows: The temperature was run up to the desired value
and held constant from 15 minutes to half ,an hour. There were fluctuations at the higher
temperatures of as much as 10 degrees either way so that a mean temperature wa cho en
as repr senting the true conditions. The breakdown voltage of the gap ,va then determined
by at last 10 trial for each pre ure. The pre ure was increa d in tep of 10 pound per
square inch. The pressures were read by two small pre sure gauge whose raneres were from
o to 100 pounds per square inch. The spark potentials were read 0 a high a pre ure as it
was po ible to obtain without the spark pa ing over the outside of the insulator. Then the
pressure was reduced in steps of 20 pounds and reading again made. As a whole the return
readinga check d the first readings well. This can be een from the plots where maximum
sparking voltage i plotted against the pressure for each temperature. A the oltage whi h
could be u ed without sparking over the out ide of the porcelain wa' about 19,000 volt, no
voltages were measured above thi. The pressure range over which the mea urements co uld
be carried out started from 60 pounds at room temperature and incr a ed until at 200 0 C., or
thereabouts, pre sures of 100 pounds could be u eel.
From then on the pre iures were limiLed with increasing temperatures by a new phenomenon
which may have been caused by electron emi sion from the hot terminal at high voltage.
Under these conditions the spark was replaced by fl. sort of purple bru h discharge (corona)
which came on grac1ualJy as the vol tag wa increa ed.

EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE ON THE SPARKING VOLTAGE.

119

I t was at first thought that this glow discharge might be an important factor in causing
ignition trouble. Fmther measur.cments were therefore made in the same apparatus but
wiLh a Bosch D- 6 magneto as a source of volLage. With this arrangement no brush discharge
could be detected aHhough the observations were carri.ed to 760° C. Above 600° C. the electrical conductivity of the porcelain insulator wa great enough to prevent the magneto from
sparking at the higher pressures, but there was no sign of brush discharge under any conditions .
It is probable that a certain time is required for such a discharge to form and that the very
sudden application of voltage produced by the magneto does not admit of this.
RESULTS.

The curves plotted between maximum sparking potentials in kilovolts and pressure in
atmospheres may be seen in plots 2, 3, and 4. The results represented by all these curves,
except the one for low temperature measurement with the larger terminals could be repeated
consistently. I t is possible that a stronger source of ionization should have been pr ovided,
and the voltage increased still more slowly in this case. The slight curvatures of the lines may
be due in part to the gauges, since no calibration corrections were applied. The direction of the
curvature is the sarno as that noted by oLhor observers.
The data given in the curves were analyzed by first reading from each of the curves tho
pressure corresponding to a given voltage, say 10,000 volts. From this pressure and the temperature pertaining to t~e curve, the relative density of the ga is then computod by the formu la :
p =

o
00

=273

P
T

where 00 is tho donsiLy at 1 atmosphere and 273° absolute, P is the pressure in atmospheres,
and T the absoluto temperature in degrees centigrade. This was done for six different volt ages on each plug. Table I gives the results on plug No . 1 at 10,000 and 8,000 volts, and is
typical of the other data. It is evident that the densitites thus obtained are constant within
a few per cent over the entire range and show no systematic change with temperature or
pressures.

It may therefore be concluded that the breakdown voltage is a function of the gas density
only. To determine the form of this function the average values of density obtain ed as
described above are plotted against the corresponding voltage in plot 5. The curves thus
obtained show that the breakdown voltage is a linear function of the density but is not proportional to it. The data can be represented by the following equations:

Plug No.1
Plug ro. 2
P lug No.3

E=2.2+3. 1 p
E=1.8+4 .0 p
E=2.4+3 .4 p

Where E is the sparking voltage in kilovolts and p is the density relative to air at atmospheric pressure and 0° C. The constants in these equations are of course dependen t upon the
shape and spacing of the electrodes, and would be smaller for the case of the shorter 0.5mm
(0.020 inch) gaps uscd in spark plugs.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS .

In addition to the measurements with alternating current described above, a second series
of tests was made, u ing aBo ch D-6 magneto as the source of e. m. f. and a special crest voltmetor equi ment 1 to measure the breakdown voltage.
This equipment consi ted of an Albrecht electrostatic voltmeter connected in series with
a G. E. kenotron (electric valve) a hown in figure 6. This valve permits current to flow
when the heated filament F is negative with respect to the relatively cold anode A, but allows
no current to flow in the reverse direction. Consequently, a negative charge accumulates on
the insulated conductOl, formed by the anode and the case of the electrometer, of such amount
that when the sparking electr.ode and voltmeter needle are at their greatest positive potential
the filament and anode are at the same potential, and there is no tendency for further charging.
During the res t of the time the ncedlc of thc voltmeter is near ground potential, but the rectifying effect of the kenotron prevents the charge from leaking off. Consequently the meter comes
to a steady deflection which measures the maximum positive voltage applied.
Rum were made with this apparutu at tempel'ature~ of 460 0 C. and 520 0 C. up to pressures of 150 pounds per square inch, using a Champion (Toledo) plug No.4 with X-bend electrodes set with the ll'mal spacing of 0.5 rom. (0.030 inch). The result as obtained are plotted
in plot 7 and the combined data from the ~e curves are plotted again. t relative den ity in
plot 5, giving a line whose equation is
E= 1.1 + 1.7p.
These measurements with th magneto and crest voltmeter showed the \Jlesence of a further complication due to the fact that the heat of the spark raised the temperature of the elect10des very materially. This in turn heated the ga.? near them so that the discharge occurred
through gas which was decidedly le.;;8 deme than the surrounding atmo phete. This was
indicated by the fact that at fu"t starting the magneto the vo~tmetel' showed a relatively high
voltage (in one ca e 4,100 volts), which decreased graduuUy for nearly a minute, after which
it remained constant at a much lower value (2,350 volts). The time required for th~ change
implies very strongly that it is a purely th('rmal effect rather than any ionization due to the
preceding sparks, since the latter effect would be ahno t ins tantaneous. In the case of a spark
plug in an engine cylinder, the central. elel'trode, being insulated thermally as well as electri·
cally by the core, is much hotter than the incoming charge and consequently this effect may
be pI e- ent to some extent.
A a check upon the laboratory datfL mea.surements WOle also made in a Hall-Scott A-5
aviation engine having a comple'i.",ion ratio of 4.2 :1. Owing to the late closing of the intake
valve and the advance of the 'ipark, the actual ratio of cylinder volume at intake to that at
ignition was only 3.2:1. If it can be <1'1s umed that the charge in the cylinder is at atmospheric
pressure and temperature at the closing of the intake valve, then the relative density at ignition will be 3.2. Plug o. 4 waR run in this engine firing from a Dixie" 88" magneto. The
crest voltage as mea ured by the kenotron was found to be 5,950 volts . Measurements with a
calibrated spark gap having 1 cm. spheres indicated 4,500 volts. The voltage predicted for
this density from figure 5 is 6,400 v01ts .
In comparing these results it mu t be borne in mind that the crest voltmeter loses its
charge very slowly, '30 that it leallv indicates the highest peak occurring during two or three
minutes pl'eceding the reading. The parallel spark gap, on the other hand, is adjusted to fire
about haU the time and probably give:; more nearly the average crest voltage. It appears,
therefore, that the results obtained in the laboratory are in substantial agreement with those
found on the engine, and that the lin ear relation between voltage and density may be safely
applied to ignition circuits .
It will b(l noted that the results shown in plot 5 can be represented roughly by a straight
line through the origin, such as is sh own dotted, and which indicate3 a direct proportionality
between the sparking voltage and density. This relation will be found u eful in cases where
the voltage iil known at SOme one density and it is desired to estimate it for another density

not too widely different. It is unsafo, however, to use this law of direct proportionality to
extrapolate over a long range from the parking voltage at normal atmospheric den ity to that
at a very high density.
CONCLUSIONS.

These experiments confirm the relation that the breakdown voltage of a spark >gap depends
only upon the density of the ga~ and varies with pressme and temperatme only as they affect
the density. This relation i found to be valid up to 800 0 C. and 8 atmospheres pressme.
Both the pl'e3Sme and temperatme of the charge in a gasoline engine increase very greatly
during the compression stroke, but the parking voltage can be computed from the linear
relation hown in plot 5 without a knowledge of the e variables separately, since the den ity
is determined solely by the original density and the compression ratio. For mall change in
den ity, as between engines of different compression ratios, the assumption that the voltage is
proportional to the den ity may be made.
.
Wi~h the sudden discharge from an ignition coil or magneto a disruptive spark is produced even at temperatmos where a 60-cycle voltage would produce a brush di charge.
The voltaae required for a spark plug set at 0.5 mm. (0.020 in ch) in an aviation engine of
moderate compre 'sion is of the order of magnitude of 6,000 vol~'S.

INVESTIGATION OF THE MUFFLING PROBLEM

REPORT No. 55.
INVESTIGATION OF THE MUFFLING PROBLEM FOR AIRPLANE ENGINES.
By G. n. UPTON and V. R. GAGE.

The initial perception of the presence of an airplane comes commonly through hearillg
rather than sight. When near a plane the noise of the unmuffied engine is fairly deafening.
If muffling can be contrived without too large a loss of power it will become much easier for
the pilot to operate his plane, a cut-out being provided for engine-testing pmposes. In civil
use of planes, if pas engel'S are to be' carried or if planes become numerous, muming will almost
surely be required, as it now is for automobiles, motor boats, and stationary engines. In
military use of the planes the advantages to be derived from silent operation, if that is possible,
are immensely greater; for example, with night-bombing airplanes.
A preliminary report upon this subject was printed as Report No. 10 of the Second Annual
Report of the rational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, 1916, pages 41 to 49; hereinafter
referred to as Report No. 10. This report outlined the problem, gave the status of muffling for
automobile engines, and gave the beginnings of our experimental work. For the main part of
the experimental work, Prof. V. R. Gage has been associated with the initial staff of Profs.
H. Diederichs and G. B. Upton.
In the early summer of 1917 the Cmtiss engine was taken over by the U. S. A. S. M. A.
at Ithaca. A considerable amount of experimental data had already been accumulated.
Designs of mufflers had been worked out to be tried upon planes in field work. At this time,
however, muffling was much less important than the production of engines and planes, so that
field experiments with mufflers were not carried out.
The work has fallen into two divisions: First, the determination of the relation between
back pressure in the exhaust line and consequent po vel' loss, for various combinations of speed
and throttle positions of the engine. Second, the construction and trial of muffier designs,
covering both type and size. The main body of the work has been done on a Curtiss OX eightcylinder airplane engine, 4 by 5 inches, rated 70 horsepower at 1,200 revolutions per minute.
For estimation of the muffiing ability and suppres ion of II bark" of indi idual exhausts, we
have also used an "Ingeco" stationary, single cylinder, 5Y2 by 10 inch, throttling governed
gasoline engine, and occasionally other engines.
On the Curtiss engine the carburetor was a Schebler model L. The throttle control rod
was graduated and adapted for duplication of settings by means of a screw setting into holes.
Adjustment of needle valve and cams controlling the mixture was once m~de and was not
subsequently changed. The ignition was by Bosch magneto ,· ith fixed spark, set in the
v
advanced position by the manufacturer's instructions. This adjustment was never changed.
The spark plugs gave trouble and had to be renewed. The engine was started by power from
an electric (street car) motor, belted to a pulley which was keyed on the end of the fan dynamometer shaft, on the end away from the engine. The engine was brought to a moderate speed
with the magneto short circuited and then ignition was turned on and the belt thrown off the
fan dynamometer pulley simultaneou~ly. Cooling water was supplied to the engine from the
water mains through the regular circulating pump. The water supply valve was always opened
to the same point, which had been found by trial to give slightly more than adequate cooling.
ft was found that air locks might occm and to detect them separate discharges lines were used,
one from each block of cylinders.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIO.r AL ADVISORY COM 1:ITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

In the determination of power losses due to the muffiers it was desirable that the engine
should 'ive a dynamometer with the same torque-speed characteristics as a propeller. We
therefore built a fan dynamometer, copying in detail the dimensions of one at the
Automo ile Club of America's laboratory at New York City. This design of fan has previously
twice been calibrated using cradle dynamometers. The fan has two blades set diametrically
opposite. These blades are rectangular plates 14 by 10 inches, with the lO-inch dimension
radial. As used, the outside diameter across the blades was 42 inches, requiring 35.4 horsepO'wer at 1,000 revolutions per minute, and.for other po\\-ers varying with the cube of the speed.
'l'his adjustment holds the engi.ne to rated load at rated speed (61.2 horsepower at 1,200 revolutions per minute, 69.1 horsepower at 1,250, 77. horsepower at 1,300). Dimensions and
calibration of the fan are given more completely in Appendix A.
The determination of the power consumed by the fan depends solely upon the measurement of speed. For the reading of speed we used a Hopkins electrical tachometer, with its
dynamo dTiven directly by the engine crankshaft through a flexible coupling. The tachometer
was calibrated several times during the progress of the work, both in place on the engine and
on a small high-speed lathe.
To determine the power loss due to back pressure, we put exhaust maniiolds on the engine
along each block of four cylinders and combined the exhausts in a cross pipe at the rear of the
engine, as illu trated in figure 1, a photograph of the set-up. The cross pipe ended in a tee
with two valves, one a gate valve for adjustment and the other a quick-opening valve, similar
to a "molasses" valve. The second valve was used either entirely open or entirely shut; the
change from closed to open and reverse could be made instantly. In running to d termine
power loss the engine would be set at a given throttle position with the quick-opening valve
wide open; then closing that valve the gate valve was set to give a desi.red back pressure. Runs
were then made, alternately, in quick succession, with the quick-opening valve open and shut.
In each condition readings were taken of speed and back pressure. 'l'he alternation of conditions was repeated several times, until the drop of speed (and power losses) associated with a
certain back pressure seemed well determined.
There was one manifold for each block of four cylinders composing one leg of the vee.
The back pressures of the two groups of cylinders ,yere read separately and independently.
The manometer connections were made in each manifold at a point about 6 inches beyond the
la t cylinder and the two fittings were identical in construction. The pressure taps ,,,ere made
of small brass Tods riveted over inside nearly flush with the manifold, with a lock nut out ide
the manifold. The openings through the rods "Were the same and were about ft inch in diameter. This construction was used in order to minimize as far as possible any errors of pressure
due to the effect of velocity and to damp the pulsations of pressure. If any such velocity
effects did enter into the observations of pressure they would disappear in the taking of the
pressure difference of nms ,yith and without applied back pressure . . Taking the pressure
readings so close to the engine was intentional; all manifold and piping resistance beyond these
taps will be shown in the readings, and it was a matter of interest to discover how serious these
losses might be, due to the use of lono- or improper exhaust piping.
From the pr'essure taps connection was made through rubber tubing of about Xi -inch inside
diameter and 6 feet long to mercury manometers. A considerable mass of mercury was used
in each manometer to obtain the damping effect of its inertia. Further damping was found
necessary and was secured by StuifU1g the upper ends of the manometer tubes with cotton
waste. With the engine running, the back-pre sure readings were satisfactorily steady and
practically without time lag in shifting from running with and without applied back pressures.
The frrst series of runs was made to determine the poy;er losses caused by different applied
back pressures with the engine under a fixed throttle position, set for normal power and speed.
rrhe observations taken are shown in the first fOUT columns of 'l'able 1. The other' values shown
in Table I are the results of computations from the averages of the data.
The true speed, revolutions per minute, is obtained from the tachometer readings by the
use of calibrations made before and after groups of tests. The correction factor for the tacho-

back pressure. If the speed with applied back pres ure was 97 per cent of the original speed, the
power loss was (1.00)3 - (0.97)3 = 1.00 - 0.9 127 = .7 per cent. This relation is true because of
the loading of the engine by the fan dynamometer . The power absor'b ed by the fan is propOl·tional to the cube of the speed. (Appendix A.)
The brake M. E. P. (bral<e mean effective pressure) is the product of the mechanical efficiency of the engine and the m ean effective pressure as shown by an indicator diagram, and is
expressed in pounds per square inch . For this engine:

Various resul ts from this group of teots, a shown in Table I , are shown as curves in plots
2 to 5, inclusive. In all of the e curves the abscissa is the applied back preSSUTe measured in
inches of mercury. This" applied back pressure" is strictly the increase of manometer reading, •
over that given with open discharge from exhaust manifolds and piping, with the application
of a definite con triction of discharge.
Plot 2 shows the power losses, in per cent, as a function of the applied back pressure.
With no applied back pI' ure the throttle was set and locked to give about 1,23 0 r. p. m.,
corresponding to about 65 horsepower output to the dynamometer. The engine did not always
come back to this speed and power when the back pressure was relieved, because of many
minor variations of ignition, carburetion, lubrication, cooling, etc. These changes were cared
for by the method of testing employed, as previously described. The results as to power loss
in plot 2 will be found only for one setting of the throttle on this engine. It could not be assumed
that the same percentage power 10 s would be found, for a given applied back pressure, on
another engine, or even with other throttle positions on this engine. These power losses are
conditioned, also , by the dynamometer characteristic of power varying with cube of speed.
They would not hold for automobile engine operation in general, because the load characteris tic would be different. This curve is, however, approximately typical, in form and in numerical value, of average flying conditions with airplane motors, when the exhaust is choked by
any means to increase the back pressure. This curve gives the information desired concerning the relative magnitude of the power losses incident to increasing the back pressure of an

airplane engine by attempts at muffling. If sati factory noise suppres ion can be secured with
small increa es of back pressure, the power loss may be tolerable.
For moderate back pre sures the power loss is substantially proportional to the back
pressure. For higher back pre sures the power loss mounts rapidly, apparently at such a rate
that a baeI<: pressure of even les than 10 pounds l~ er squar e inch (20 inches mercury) would
stop the engine. These relations are perhaps better brought out in plot 3, which is the S~Lme
as plot 2 except that the coordinate are logarithmically scaled. The full lin e curve in plot
3 is the curve of plot 2 tran ferred. The dash line in plot 3 shows what would happen if the
power los continued to be proportional to the back pressure.
A possible explanation of this changing effect of back pressure as the back pressure increases
may be found by con idering the indicator card. This is schematically hown in figure 4.
For small back pressures we may expect the main e-[ect to be a lifting of the exhaust line of
the card by an amount sub tantially equal to the increase of back pressure. The result would
be a loss of indicated M. E. P. equal to the back pressure, because the elevation of the exhaust
line would extend through the whole troke. The loss of brake M. E. P. will be smaller than
the loss of indicated M. E. P. in the ratio of the mechanical efficiency of the engine to unity .
. At higher back pressures the exhaust ga es are held back in greater amoun ts in the cylinder ,
leaving the clearance pace, at the end of the exhaust period, fi lled with an adnormal weight
of hot, dead gases . These, reexpanding, interfere with the incoming charge in various ways,
les ening the amount of the fuel mixture drawn in. The decrease of charge quantity will
result in a decrease of M. E. P. which is added to the decrease of M. E. P. due to lifting of the
pressure of the exhaust line.
Proba,bly it is the decrease of charge which is the principal reason for the po ibility of
stalling the engine by fairly completely choking the exhaust pipe and before complete closure
is reached.
To make the findings of power loss caused by applied back pre sure more general, not so
much a matter of the particular case studied, the re ults are given a 10 s of brake M. E. P. ,
by the curve on plot 5. The previous discussion of the effect of back pres ure upon the indicator
card explains the form of this curve and the relations between the test curve and the line of
equality of brake 1. E. P. loss and back-pre sure increase. For the smaller and reasonable
values of bac7e pressure it is quite safe to assume that the loss of bra7ce M. E . P. (pounds per square
inch) does not exceed, and is nearly equal to, the applied back pressure (in pounds per square inch).
This conclusion is of considerable importance to the de io-ner of eno-ine , exhaust manifolds,
and muffiers, and is probably valid for all types and services of internal-combustion engines .
Of in terest to the airplane designer i the loss of propeller speed con equent upon back
pressure in the engine exhaust. Since propeller speed is tied, in a definite relation, to propeller power, the curve of plot 6 is really another version of plot 2. This curve of plot 6 should
correspond approximately to average running conditions of airplane motors. It i about a
three-quarter throttle position curve for this engine, and full throttle would probably change
the form of the curve only at the higher back pressures.
In th second series of test the engine was brought up to abou t normal speed and power.
The regul ting valve at the end of the exhau t pipe was cIo ed, allowing all the exhaust to
leak through the joints of the piping an d through the wall of the flexible metallic exhaust
hose when the end outlet valve was closed. The value of back pre sure was purpo ely made
large, in order to give more accurate readings of back pressure, and to see what would happen.
Readings of speed and back pre sure were then taken with the end outlet valve al ternately
open and shut, until the values seemed to check among themselves. Then the throttle opening
was reduced, and again readings were taken. Immediately after the smallest advisable throttle
gun, the normal tm:ottle as used at first was r eproduced, and a check run was made.
Table II gives the data and the compu tations of the runs made on August 24 and 29 . The
exhaust piping was changed between August 24 and 29 by making the pipe Joints tighter.
Plot 7 shows the relation between the brake horsepower and the actual back pr e sure, as
given in T able II. The back pressure increases as some exponential function of the horsepower)

INVESTIGATION OF MUFFLING PROBLEM.

when the conditions of the exhaust passages remain unchanged. The same curves are shown
on plot 8, using logarithmic instead of arithmetic coordinates. The lope of these curves is
slightly less than 1.5, indicating about the 1.5 power of the engine output. An analysis of the
muffler tests made at the University of Michigan (printed in Horseless Age, May, 1915) also
indicates that the back pressure varies with about the 1.5 power of the engine output. (An
analysis of some of the features of the University of Michigan report is given as Appendix B.)
Neglecting changes of mechanical and thermal efficiency, the weight of exhaust gases, per
unit of time, must be nearly proportional to the brake horsepower.
0, for a rouah approximation, the quantity of exhaust gas can be substituted for the brake hor epower, as abscissre
of the curves, plots 7 and 8. The quantity of fluid discharged through orifices is nearly proportional to the square root of the pressure difference across the orifices. By analogy it would
be expected that the slope of the curves on plot 8 should be nearly 2. A contributing feature
in the fact that they are not may possibly be explained by the common method of averaging
and reading a fluctuating pressure. Averaging in case of pulsations is quite often done by
damping. The damping of the oscillations mayor it may not give a nearly true average of
the pressure. But the instantaneous rate of flow through the orifice is proportional to the
square root of the pressure at that instant. So for a pulsating flow there should be found
the integration of the product of the average of the square roots of the pressures and the time
interval during which the pressures existed, not the product of the square root of the average
of the pressUTes and the total time. The latter method was used, agreeably to the common
practice under such circumstances. The flow and the preSSUTe difference in the exhaust manifolds are widely and rapidly pulsating. The average pressure as indicated on the manometer.
may be far from the average preSSUTe value which should be used in determining the flow
However, when measuring the exhaust back pressUTes in this conventional manner, the empirical
relation here shown may be quite useful-that the back pressUTe varies approximately as the
horsepower of the engine, raised to the 1.5 power.
Plots 9 and 10 give information very applicable to muffling of airplane engines. They
show how rapidly the back preSSUTe rises to high values as the engine is opened out to full
power and speed. The numerical values are obtained from Table II. Plot 9 shows the result
of excessive choking of the exhaust which was purposely done in this case to bring out the
action. The two curves of plot 9 result from slightly different initial conditions. Plot 10
shows the back pressure due to exhaust piping, only, including sharp turns, some extra pipe
resistance, and fittings on oUT experimental set-up. This curve is of the same type and of the
same magnitude of back pressure values which would come from a good muffler. It should
be carried in mind that with these figures the engine was driving a fan whose charactcristics
correspond to an airplane propeller. The form of the curves is conditioned by this type of
loading.
I n attempting to analyze the data of Table II, reducing the loss of engine torque to terms
of brake M. E. P., the result is the "shotgun" diagram of plot 11. Interpretation of this is
highly speculative considering the small amount of data which was collected. The analy is •
here attempted is much broader than the special problem which was being studied, and so no
special runs were made to get the information needed to complete thi figure. Curve OB is
transposed bodily from plot 5, representing runs at fixed throttle and varying exhaust conditions.
The str aight line OF on plot 11 represents, as near as possible, the average relation from the
runs with varying throttle against fixed exhaust conditions. Since the engine was coupled to
a fan dynamometer, speed and throttle position are tied together except for the light modifications due to back pressures, etc. The small numbers adjacent to the points in plot 11 give
the approximate r. p . m. of the engine and fan; and equal speeds nearly coincide with equal
throttle positions. The apparent scattering of the points may indicate that the points do not
belong upon one curve, but upon a family of constant throttle curves such as 00, OD and OE,
all similar to OB. The curve OB was at about three-fourths throttle of the engine.
Table III and plot 12 are put in as a demonstration that the choking of the exhaust by
sharp turns, pipe iittings, etc., give the same results as choking by a muffler. 0Ll. August 29,

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY OOMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

after taking the data given in T able II, the exhaust piping connections were changed some·
what in order to tryout a muffler. The wire-gauze-filled muffler, described on page 48 and
figure 4 of Report No. 10, was put on the open end of the exhaust manifold piping. Runs were
made with and without the muffler as resistance, giving the data shown , n Table III, and in
i
plot 12. This is comparable with plot 7, the lower curve of plot 7 being reproduced as the
upp I' curve of plot 12. All three curves are evidently of the same type. H ence the information
o"!Ytained.from Tables I and II and their analysis will be applicable to the analysis ofmuifier actions
so .far as bac7c pressures and power losses are concerned.
In the cour e of the experimental work so far described some peculiar phenomena were
noted. One such was an abnormal power ell'op, considering the back pressure, at certain
"cri tical speed ." It was found that thi abnormal power 10 s was avoided by a very small
.change of speed cither way from the critical. The critical speed changed or disappeared with
change of exhaust manifold. Apparently some manifolds would not show this phenomena;
probably the curved manifold would be free from it. The supposed cause of this abnormfl l
power loss at a critical speed is a reflected wave of exhaust gas filling the clearance of some
cyli nder just before its exhaust valve closes.
Study of this effect led- to a suggested design of an exhaust manifold, and ultimately to
the design of a muffler. If the pulses of exhaust gas, following the opening of successive exhaust
valves, could be so trapped that they would never return to their own or other cylinders by
direct motion, or by reflection, interference and abnormal power 10 es would be avoided, and
the muffling problem itself might be simplified. The scheme selected was rather similar to the
muffler design shown in figur 3, page 47, of Report J o. 10. The exhaust of each cylinder
was to enter, tangentially, the annular space between two concentric cylinder. In this space
the exhaust gas, entering with high velocity and pressure, could spin around, dissipating its
energy both by friction and by progressive leakage through numerous small holes in the inner
cylinders. The inner cyli nder, continued outward from the manifold, was' to become the
exhaust pipe. A design for a manifold-muffler of this type is shown in figure 13. The tangential
entrance effects the trapping of the exhaust pulse, preventing its direct or indirect return to
any cylinder. This is shown more in detail in figure 14.
While a device of this character (figure 13) might be successful in normal operation of an
automobile engine, it was discarded as unsuited for airplane engine service. First, the internal
construction would burn out owing to the great heat of the exhaust gases in airplane servi e,
and secondly, the radiant heat from the large surface of the manifold would prohibit the
installation. The first objection may be met, and the second minimized, by the more compact
construction suggested in figure 15, which could well be built with a smaller external diameter
than the other design.
Th remainder of the experimental w rk con isted of trials of various commercial mufflers
and of experimental mufflers df' igned and built by the authors of this report. The experimental apparatus remained, in general, unchanged . The dynamometer, the tachometer, and
the arrangements for reading back pres ures remained the same and were used as before. Power
losses du e to the application of muffiers were found as Clescribed previously in the Cl etermination
of power 10 ses due to applied back pressures. When the emphasis was upon the determination
of muffii.ng ability, and tbe compari on of various mufllers with each other as silencers, the
determination of power loss was inferred from t.he back pre sure reading and general engine
speed . This method is more accurate than the direct determination of power los from speed
drops, becau e the power los es from the muffiers finally selected were small. The drop of speed
was too small to read sati ft)'ctorily while the back pres ure was still a readily measurable
quantity.
Usually, when working with muffiers, the Curtiss engine was set to run at its recommended
speed of 1,200 to 1,250 r. p. m., developing about 70 horsepower. A scale of throttle settings
had been made so that this, and other settings, could be duplicated . Generally one mufHerwas
used for the ent-ire engino, taking the exhaust from all eight cylinders. The setup shown in
figure 1 was then modified by pu tting the quick-opening valve on the side ou tlet of the tee on

the end of the cross manifold, allowing the installation of the mumer under test, without a valve,
in the direct line of the exhaust flow. The back pressure due to the mumer could then be
determined, by taking alternate readings as before, with the quick-opening valve open and shut.
The data of Tables III, VI, and part of VII came from this arrangement.
In a few tests, concerning particularly the capacity of muliers, the cross manifold was
removed. A mumer could then be placed directly on the end of the tock exhaust manifold
for one block of four cylinders. Generally a mumer was placed on each of the two manifolds.
The mumers then had to be applied and removed by hand in order to determine the back pressure due to the mumer. This procedure was used for getting t.he data of Table IV, using the
G. P. F. 12-inch and 28-inch mufflers, and part of Table VII.
Estimates were always made of the silencing qualities of the mumer being tested. In the
end the devices solected as most promising were put through comparative tests, where rapid
substitutions were made by hanel. For this work it seemed desirable to make an open-air
estimation of tho noise of the exhaust and the degreo of silencing with the various mufflers.
To get the exhau t outdoors and pointed in the right direction tho tee and valves on the end
of the cross manifold were removed. At the end of the cross manifold direct connection was
made to a 2-inch piping system consisting of a 6-foot length of pipe, a 45° ell, and a second
6-foot length of pipe. This piping did not mume the exhaust to any noticeable degree. The
back pressure due to the piping, at normal engine speed, was about 1 inch of mercury. TIns
measurement, in itself, may be of considerable interest in the problem of the dispo al of engine
exhaust on airplanes. The data of Tables VIn and IX were taken with the mufflers placed
outdoors in this manner.
Many devices and ideas for silencing were considered, and quite a few were tried out. All
devices with which tests were made, and which were found worthy, as well as a fow which were
rejected, are included in the descriptive matter which follows. Of the rejected schemes, only
those are described which are based upon some peculiarly attractive idea, or which are akin
to common practice. The experimenters (the authors of this report) applied quite peculiar
descriptive nomenclature to some of these devices. For the sake of brevity, some system of
naming is necessary, so those designations will be perpotuated, and the derivation of the appellation briefly indicated.
G. P. F.-These mufflers are shown in figure 2 and described on page 43 of Report No.
10. Four of these were used, two each of the two sizes. All were 5 inches diameter, two were
12 inches long, the other two were 2 inches long. They were made by Geuder, Paeschke &
Froy Co. These are regular stock muffiers.
Maxim.-A Maxim silencer for Fords was purchased of a local garage. The entrance to
this mumer was only 1.5 inches internal diameter. The tail pipe was 12 inches long, tapering
from 1.5 inches diameter at the muffler to 1 inch diameter at the outlet. It was hardly fair to
use this on a 70 horsepower engine; bu t the data is of grea t in teres t.
Manifold rnufJle1's.-The name comes from the original idea of putting several of those
devices in line, end to end, one for each cylinder, the combination to replace the exhaust manifold. However, tIns manifolding schemo was never thoroughly tried out; the one unit of the
device was used as a mumer, with conventional installation at the ond of the manifold. As
originally cons~l'ucted the inner cylinder did not touch the end plate, so that the exhaust could
escape around the end as well as through the holes of the inner cylinder. The end path could be
blocked by a piece of asbestos board fastened to the end plate. This first manifold muffler was of
the same general design as shown in figure 16 and figure 17, but with the outer cylinder 6 inches
long instead of 9 inches, and containing only the 31 inch perforated inner tube.
The "Long Manifold Muffler" was made up of two outer sections of the first manifold
muffler, maJcing an outer cylinder 12 inches long. The inner tube was not perforated and ex.ten led the full length of the muffler, its serrated end touching the far end plate. The exhaus t
en tered the outer cylinder near one end through the regular tangential en trance of this type of
muffler. The entrance of the second unit was blocked. The annular space was both spin and

expansion chamber for the exhaust gases, which 'escaped into the inner tube only through its
serrated end, at the opposite end of the muffler from the gas entrn.nce and exit.
Later a " Jew Manifold Muffier" was built similar to the sections which were first made,
but 3 inches longer, and with provision for slipping an extra p erfor ated inner tube of 2t inche
diameter inside of the regular 3 _-inch inner cylinder. This l a t design of the manifold muffler
is shown in figure 16, with the extra inner tube in place, and in figure 17 assembled and disassembled. The manifold mufflers are developments of the muffler hown in figure 3, pago
47, of R epor t o. 10.
Wire mesh type.-Several of this type were built and tried out. The general scheme is
shown in figure 4, page 4 , of the Report o. 10. The idea is to gradually increase the resistance, and to break up the energy, of the exhau t by means of sections filled with fine wire
mesh. The finest mesh was used at the outlet, and the mesh increasing in size toward the engine.
Spiral guide vane.- This scheme consisted of an expansion chamb er, with spirals in the
annular outlet passage, instead of the wire mesh. The spirals formed, in effec t, a long nozzle.
Various forms of spiral were tried: of constant pitch, or area of passage; with area of pa age
growing smaller toward the outlet, forming a sort of converging nozzle, and with the area of
passage i creasing toward the discharge end. The general design of these is based on that of the
i(axim ilencer, but there is not the repeated reversal of flow in the spirals.
Whirl chambel' m~fflers.
0 called from their general cons true tion. Figures 17, 1 ,19, and 20
show the form of these mumers. The exhaust pipe is flattened from a circular cross section at
the engine to a rectangle at the mumer, giving a eontracted nozzle effect. This rectangular
section i fastened tangentially to the circumference of a ring of con iderably larger diameter.
One cover plate for one side of the ring is a plate di hed to give stiffness. The other cover is the
outlet for the gas, and consists of a truncated cone . The exhau t gases enter the ring tangentially,
swirling around and around inside the ring. As tbey lose velocity they gradually escape through
the opening between the dished cover plate and the end of the tnmcated cone. Four of these
mufflers were made, one each with ring 4 inches and 12 inche in diameter, two with 7-inch
diameter rings. The 4-inch and 12-inch diameter were made with the idea of having one of them
too small and the other too large. The exhaust pipe entering the muffler was contracted from
a 2-inch diameter to a rectangle I-inch wide, except that one 7-inch ring had a nozzle t inch
wide. The sides of the rectangle had the same total perimeter as the circumference of a 2-inch
circle. This is a constructional requirement. The width, or depth, of the cylindrical ring was
limi ted to the length of the rectangular di charge nozzle, plus clearance neces ary in manufacture. This makes the rings 4 inches deep with the I-inch nozzles, and 4t inches with the
t -inch nozzle used on one of the 7-inch whirl chambers. The cover plates were dished about
i inch, this being the maximum obtainable with the local tin mith. The design called for
t inch. These plates could be applied with the convex surface in or out as indicated in figure
19. The area of the open end of the truncated cone was the same as that of the exhaust
pipe, that is, 2 inches diameter. The space between the end of the truncated cone and the cover
plate was varied from time to time by the various arrangements, some of which are indicated
in figure 19. hallow cones were available as well as the deep ones. With deep cone, and
cover plate dished inward, the clearance through which the exhaust had to escape was about
i inch. With cover plate dished outward the clearance became t inch. With shallow cone the
clearance was 1 ~ inches.
The 7-inch whirl chamber muffier was also tried out with a double cone assembly, one cone
pointed inward and one outward . (Diagram of arrangement in Table VII.) Thi assembly
was also tried with a "diffuser" plate between the two cones. One diffuser was a plate with
about 100 soattered ft-.inch holes punched through it. Another diffu er tried with both 7-inch
and 12-inch whirl chambers had no holes, or very small ones, in the 120° sector first pas ed by
the entering gas, the next 120° with larger hole, and still larger holes in last 120°.
The Duplex whirl chamber muffler consi ted of the two 7-inch ring bolted end to end, using
Qne of the tangential nozzles as entrance, and the other as discharge passage . . The arrangement
required the reversal of internal whirling before the gas could get out. Generally one or the

other of the diiTuser plates was placed between the two rings. The I-inch nozzle 'was used as
'ntrance in most cases.
Venturi.-A 2-inch pipe Venturi with %; inch throat was tried, upon the idea of an expanding nozzle to secure an adiabatic drop of pres ure and temperature of the gas, also, to increase
the velocity of the gas above the velocity of sound, so as to prevent any ound waves is uing
from inside the manifold. The Venturi was used alone, and in combination with the 7-incb
whirl chamber muffler, the Venturi then acting as a discharge pipe.

The problem of silencing the exhaust noise from an internal combustion engine is fairly
comparable with the problem of silencing a high velocity rifle, or better, a machine gun. At
the instant that an exhau t valve begins to open, the gases seeking to escape from the cylinder
have a pre sure in the neighborhood of 40 pounds per square inch gauge and temperatures of the
order of 1,000° F. Where the endeavor is to ge t maximum power from the engine, these values
are under tated . If adiabatic expansion i assumed at the time of r ele!l.se, the initial velocity
of the disch!l.rging gas is independent of the pressure into which the gas is escaping, because
the " critical pressure" is greater than the pressure in the manifold or atmosphere . The initial
veloci ty "Will be the veloci ty ~f sound at the " cri tical" pressure and existing temperature of the
g!l.S at this pressure. This velocity of the exhaust gas is of the order of 1,500 to 2,000 feet per
second-con iderably higher than the velocity of sound through the air. The fir t portion of
the escaping exhaust is practically a slug of gas coming out like a projectile from a gun, with a
velocity greater than that of sound in air.
It is well recognized that the report of a high-velocity rifle consists of two sounds. One
sound wave, the " report," comes from the muzzle of the gun arising from the slap of bullet and

140

AUTICS.

exhaust gas upon the air adjacent to the muzzle. The other sound, of cracking, ripping quality,
come from the tearing of the air by a projectile moving with a velocity in exce s of the velocity
of sound. If the bullet is traveling toward the observer, thi second sound i heard first. The
slugs of exhau t gas from the open exhausts of an airplane motor are soon dissipated, and do
not travel far as projectiles. While they la t, however, there i litt.le doubt that they contribute
to the quality and amount of exhau t noi e from the engine.
If the velocity of the slugs of exhaust gas at the time when they enter the air can be reduced
below the velocity of sound in air, the quality of the exhaust sound will be much duller and the
quantity of noi e much less. The mo t effective way of lowering the velocity of sound in a gas
is to low I' its temperature.
There are two means of accomplishing the cooling of the exhaust gases before they reach
the atmosphere. One is by direct cooling, as by water jacketing. The other is by designing
the exhaust passages on the idea of the nozzles of a single velocity stage steam turbine, so as
to reduce the velocity of the exhaust gases to approach the velocity of sound in air, by efficient
expansion in the nozzles. This latter method was suggested by Mr. F. C. Mock. (. A. E.
Bulletin, p. 270, Vol. V, ro. 3, Dec., 1913.) It was found that uch design of exhaust ports
apparently increased engine power. However, the reduction of temperature by expanding in
nozzles is limited, if no work is done by the gas. Only the edge of the crack of the noise from
the lug of gas can be removed by means of expansion alone. If the exhaust is made to drive
a turbine, then more heat energy will be abstracted, u eful work will be done, and at the same
time the exhau t velocities will be made uniform and small.
The frequency of the exhau t from a multicylinder, high- peed engine generally is a ~ource
of a humming sound, if in any way the air is made to vibrate with the engine frequency. The
lowest audible note to the human car is of about 40 beats per seoond. The exhau t frequency
of a 12-cylinder 4-cycle engine running 1,500 r. p. m. is 150 per econd. This will be a lowtoned hum. To this hum an airplane propeller al 0 contributes harmonic which will blend
with the engine hum.
Complete muffling, so that the engine will give neither crack, whi tIe, nor hum of exhaust
noise would- involve the smoothing out of the flow of exhaust gases into the atmosphere to a
uniform velocity below that of sound. This is manife tly impraoticable. With a pulsating
flow it might be practicable to keep the maximum velocity of exhaust gas entering the air below
the velocity of sound in the air. The humming noise will then be heard, without the crack or
whistle.
The greater portion of the exhaust from a eylinder mu t pass out in this first lug of high
velocity discharge, as the average velocity of the pi ton on the exhaust stroke is only about 25
feet per second. Thi shows that the actual time required for di charging the major portion
of the exhaust of anyone cylinder i quite short compared to the period during which the
exhaust valve of thi cylinder is open. A whole group of cylinder may be discharging into one
exhaust manifold without interferences, provided the manifold is so designed that each lug of
exhau t can freely escape down the manifold without check or reflection. If too many cylinders
exhaust into one manifold, there will be overlap of the scavenging period, during which two or
more of the variou exhaust valves may be open at the same time. This overlap of the cavenging periods is a minor matter compared to what happens when a slug of exhaust enters ome
cylinder through an open exhaust valve directly or by reflection.
An exhaust manifold may reduce the crack of the exhaust by slowing down the initial
velooity of the slugs of gas, and by a limited amount of cooling. The direction in whioh the
exhaust is pointed is a considerable factor in the noise heard by observers, the intensity of
sound being much greater in the direction of projection. Long exhaust pipes may somewhat
increase the muflling effect of a manifold, by added friction and added cooling. However, the
notation on Table VII, based upon the estimates of several ob ervers, would indicate that
muflling effect of manifold and long smooth exhaust pipe Was very slight. Bends, and also
rough interior surfaces, will increa e the mufl1ing effect and also the power loss.
Any long pipe may aot as does an organ pipe, having a natural period of vibration in sound
waves. This period may happen to coincide with the frequency of the exhaust in such a way

141

that exhaust gas will be forced back into some cylinder just before the closing of its exhaust
valve, entailing an abnormal power loss at a critical speed. Such an effect was noted in the
experimental work, and was r eferred to in the discussion of Table II.
As previously stated, the silencing problem would be solved if it were feasible to reduce
the velocity of exhaust gases escaping into the air to a uniform velocity, less than the velocity
of sound. Practically, it is possible only to spread out the peak of the discharge, or the "slug"
of exhaust pulse, so that its velocity i reduced toward that of sound. Every slug of exhaust,
not only while in the exhau t sys tem but in the period of issuing from the system, is a potential
source and exciter of sound waves. The internal vibrations of the system as excited by each
slug, combine their sound with that of the impact of the lug upon the air, and change the
quality of the sound as a whole. Great irregularities of internal form of the exhaust system
may break up the internal sound waves. The sound-producing qualities of the exhaust slug
are relatively much greater than the sound waves intcrnal in the exhaust system.
A very obvious device for di sipating the excessive velocity of initial flow of each exhaust
is an expan ion chamber. The gas velocity entering the chamber is highly irregular; it is
assumed that the discharge velocity is much more nearly uniform; and the slapping of the
external air by successive exhaust slugs is stopped . This is nearly true if the chamber is
capacious enough. The slapping action takes place as theexhaust enters the expansion chamber ,
and sound waves from this point radiate outward, some of them e caping through the tail pipe.
To complete this device as a muffiN', the exit of sound waves would have to be prevented, it
being assumed that the capacity of the chamber is sufficient to prevent the slug pas ing through
as such.
If through the exhaust line there is placed a long series of baffles, each baffle will drag back
a portion of a p assing exhaust slug, delaying this portion with reference to the remainder, and
thus changing the flow from intermittent to nearly uniform. Muffling might then be secured
by a sufficient amount of baffling alone. The cost in back pressure and power loss would be
prohibitive, to say nothing of the weight of material nece ary for the baffles and general
structure. When baffling structures are used, the highly heated exhaust ga es burn out the
internal structure, and carbon deposits and oxide scale choke the baffles. This burning away
of internal parts is a very serious objection to the use of baffles in mufflers for airplane motors.
A combination of expansion chamber and baffles can be m ade into a very satisfactory
muffler. The smoothing of the pulsations of the exhaust flow is done mainly by the expansion
chamber, and with much less power loss than if it were done by baffles. The baffles permit the
expansion chamber to be made of moderate dimensions, by helping the smoothing out of the
flow. Also, if properly designed, they will nearly prevent the escape of sound waves from the
expansion chamber by reflection (backward) and dispersion (scattering and interference) of
the sound waves coming from the initial slap of the slug.
In order to get the effect of a large expansion chamber without great weight and size, the
manifolq muffler type (" whirl chamber") construction was proposed. The exhaust is brought
tangentially into an annular space between two concentric cylinders. The slugs of exhaust gas
may continue to travel around in this space, but they can not escape from this cylinder until
their velocity is sufficiently reduced to reverse or change direction in some way. If, for example,
the gas slug whirls around the chamber 20 times (it was observed to travel around more times
than this upon a single cylinder slow-speed engine) it has had, in effect, the use of an expansion
chamber of a volume 20 times the volume of the annulus. AB the gas spins, losing velocity,
. a continued series of small portions escap~, at right angles, into the inner cylinder or dis'charge
passage. The gas can more readily turn at right angles than reverse itself, so that there is
little chance for a r eturn pulse to the cylinder. In spinning around and escaping inwards, a
subdivision of the exhaust pulse is made such that the successive small portions enter the atmosphere over a comparatively long period of time, making the velocity of the exhaust gas entering the air fairly uniform instead of highly intermittent. It is also probable that the initial
slap of exhaust entering the whirl chamber of the mufflers is less than if they abruptly entered
a large expansion chamber, because there is relatively a much smaller change of size of passage.
As contrasted with the use of baffles to smooth out the exhaust pulsations, the desired end is

accomplished in these "whirl chamber" designs (and "manifold muffiers") with relatively less
power loss through back pressure.
In the typical "whirl chamber mufti rs" all metal parts had one side exposed to the air
in order to have considerable cooling effect upon the exhaust, and also to avoid the danger of
the burning away of the metal. (The succe of this cooling is illustrated upon one of the
muffiers tested, which still has upon it a paper label only slightly charred.) In so far as any
cooling of exhaust is secured, the muffling is thereby aided.
A sufficient cooling of the gas will, in itself, silence the exhaust. Such cooling is only
possible in marine practice, where water is sprayed into the exhaust line, and is found effective.
It may be desirable to place:fin for air cooling upon the exhaust manifolds, pipes, and muffiers
of airplanes. A radiator used to cool the exhaust gases for the purposes of ilencing may sound
like a humorous suggestion, and yet it may be practical on heavy duty planes.
Before a muffier can be applied to an engine thero must be a manifold of some kind to take
the exhaust gases from the engine to the muffier. This manifold is itself a source of power
loss, both through friction of flow, and through the possible interferences all-eady mentioned,
particularly the back flow of exhausts. In the early days of internal combustion engines,
manifolds were first made by bringing the pipes from the indivi~ual cylinders squarely into a
collecting pipe. The right angled turns of this design caused high back pressme and promoted
interferences. '1.'0 decrease the back pressures (and interferences) the manifolds are now made
with sweeping curves on the discharge pipes of each cylinder, making each individual pipe
have an easy entrance, in the direction of flow, into the common pipe. It is suggested that a
more compact design could be made by analogy with the "whirl chamber mum rs." The
individual exhaust pipes might be brought straight out from the cylinders, but with their
center lines so far above or below the center line of the common pipe that the uxhausts would
make tangential entrance to the common pipe. This idea is shown in the desig'n s of figures
13, 14, and 15. The change of direction of flow from the individual pipes to the common
pipe can probably be made with back pressures no larger than from the sweeping bends of the
conventional construction, and with the advantage of compactness. The smallness of back
pressure may be inferred from the data at the bottom of Table VI on the resistances of rings
with nozzles only.
Throughout all the des ign of manifolds and muffiers there is one item that must be kept
continu lly in mind . The sharp pul e of each exhau t is practically a mechanical slap or blow
upon all of the inside surfaces of the metal parts. If these metal parts are made of thin material,
as they mu t be to save weight, it is necessary to so form them that they are inherently stiff,
incapable of bucklinO' or drumming . Otherwise they will become transmitters for the exhau t
sounu to the adjacent air, with additional noises from the reverberation of the metal it elf.
Flat surfaces are to be avoided, and doubly or singly curved surfaces chosen.
The preceding paragraphs have outlined the theory of muffling and associated problems
as it developed to the authors during and after their experimental work.
Early in the work there arose the que tion of how the capacity rating of a muITler ~hould
be mad .. The data of Table IV precipitated this question. The two different si~ed muffiers
compared were presumably alike in internal design save that the longer ones contained a greater
number of the baffling elements in series. The G. P. F . design is given in figure 2 of Report
No. 10.
ccording to the makers the horsepower capacity to be handled by the 2 -inch
muffiers is four times that of the 12 inch. They recommended the 12-inch muffiers for
engines up to 553 cubic inches displacement, and the 2 -inch muffiers for engines up to
138 cubic inches. Yet it was found that' on the Curtiss engine, with one muffler handling
4 cylinders, of 251 cubic inches displacement, the 12-inch muffiers gave 2 inches of mercury
back pressme, against 4 inches from the 28-inch muffiers, and if there was any choice as to
silencinO' ability, the smaller mufflers were the better. It was also found that the 12-inch
G. P. F . muffler failed to silence a 3H by 4 inch Ohevrolet automobile motor of about 170
cubic inches displacement. Thi same 12-inch G. P. F. muffler gave the same back pressure
and better silencing effect when handling all
cylinders of the Ourtiss enO'ine (Table VIII)
502 cubic inches displacement, that it did when handling only 4 cylinders of the same engine.

INVESTIGATION OF MUFFLING PROBLEM.

143

In Table VII the data shows that one of the" manifold mufflers" had this same peculiarity of
improving its silencing, and of not increasing its back pressure when the number of cylinders
handled was changed from 4 to 8. At the same time some "whirl chamber mufflers" increased
their back pressure in the ratio of 1 to 1t or 1 to 2 when changed from handling 4 to handling
8 cylinders. If the back pressure of a muffler followed the usual laws controlling the increase
of pressure with quantity passing, the doubling of number of cylinders exhausting into a muffler
should have multiplied the back pressures by 4. The explanation is in part in the design of
the mufflers themselves, and in part due to the peculiarly intermittent flow of the exhaust
gases.
The silencing by the muffler comes in its operation upon the" slugs" of the exhaust gas,
the size and character of which is fixed by the individual cylinders. In so far as the frequency
of impulse (due either to multiplication of the number of cylinders or to the increase of speed)
is concerned, it appears that the more frequent the impulse, the easier it is to silence the exhaust
noise. The power loss, or back pressure, seems to depend upon the form and size of the individual impulses. Perhaps if the number of cylinders should exceed the present limit (12)
there might be sufficient overlap of instantaneous impulses to require a larger muffler. The
bulk of the exhaust comes at the first opening of the valve, so these.. pulses are not liable to be
superposed to any appreciable extent. The characteristics of the individual exhaust pulses
are controlled by volume of cylinder, valve timing, throttle position, ignition timing, and
mixture ratio, all of these affecting the amount of gas and its pressure at the time of opening
the exhaust valve. The speed of an airplane engine is tied with the throttle position because
of propeller characteristics, while an automobile engine tru:ottle and speed are independent.
As a matter of fact, it appears that the smaller the mufflers, up to some limit, the better
the silencing. Also the larger the mufflel·, the less the back pressure, geometric similarity
being assumed. (The 2 -inch G. P. F. muffler is not similar to the 12 inch.) The effect of
change in back pressure is slight. So that the tentative conclusio;n is reached that, with the
muffler design geometrically fixed, and if the size only is changed, then the smaller the muffler
the better the silencing and all around action, until the power loss exceeds the tolerated value .
It may be remarked that mufflers taking all cylinders of the Curtiss engine receive about
the same frequency and magnitude of impulse as if used on one side, 4 cylinders, of back geared
motors such as the Thomas or Sturtevant.
The effect of size of muffler was noted when using the ~ame mufflers on different engines.
The greater the bark of the exhaust, the better was the relative suppression by the same muffler.
The mufflers were more effective in suppressing the bark of the single cylinder farm engine
(572 by 10 inch Ingeco) than on the Curti s (4 by 5 inches).
The suggestion from the facts mentioned above is that the capacity rating of a muffler
probably should not be based upon the total displacement of the engine, so much as on the
displacement per cylinder.
In reading the discussion which follows concerning the various schemes for silencing the
exhaust which were considered in this work, it should be kept in mind that the experimenters
had formulated certain requirements and limitations for mufflers in airplane service. The
manifolding and mufflers should not be a source of fire risk from radiant heat. Muffler explosions
should be made harmless, either through sufficient strength, or provision of a breaking piece.
Weight of manifolds and mufflers must not be excessive. Any parts so disposed as to cause
head resistance must be made as small as possible and of It stream line" form. The power
lost due to back pressure must also be very small. It is desirable, but not essential, that the
muffler be durable, especially with regard to burning out the interior parts. The amount of .
silencing required is not great, compared to the usual ideas of muffling devices as exemplified
on automobiles. The reason for not requiring so effective silencing is that there are many
other noises coming from a plane moving through the air. Such noises are the hiss or whistle
of the wires, the beat or drum of the propeller, and the valve and gear noises from the engine.
It has been assumed in this report that what the experimenters and assistants called a 50 per
cent total silencing of the exhaust noise would be sufficient and satisfactory for airplanes. If
there is more silencing than this} a muffler cut-out may be needed by the pilot to judge the

engine performance. However, it was found that 75 per cent silencing was easily obtained,
so this was soon adopted as a standard.
A common device on planes is a long exhau t pointed upward. This is not a muffler, but
it is somewhat effective in directing the sound away from the ground. Long pipes running
back along the fuselage take the exhaust gas and some of the noise away from the occupants of
the plane. If pipes of smooth interior are used, the power loss due to back pre sure is relatively
mall. In Table VIn it is noted that 12 feet of 2-inch pipe with one 45° elbow caused a back
pressure of 1 inch of mercury on a Curti s ( -cylinder OX) engine, re ulting in a power loss of
about seven-tenths of 1 per cent. It i regretted that data on the back pressure due to flexible
metallic "Khau tho e was lost, but the notation made wa that 4 feet oT the 2-inch flexible hose
gave more bacle pre sure than the 12 feet of standard 2-inch wrought-iron pipe including one
45° elbow .
The first muffler tried out in this series of test wa a wire mesh muffler shown in figure 4 of
Report o. 10. The muffier type is that of expan ion chamber plus baffles, relying largely upon
the baffles for noi e uppre sion. The power 10 s was slight and the mu1:lling estimated about
50 per c nt. The weight i 15 pound , which is comparatively great. The flat metal side
probably drummed, reducing the muffling ability. It wa anti ipated that the wire gauze would
burn out and choke the passages with scale under continuous operation. Even in short operation the wire gauze began to pack although it did not burn. These prospective troubles, together
with the weight, caused the di carding of this type.
The variable pitch spiral muffler mentioned in Table V, was, as constructed, cumbersome.
Its silencing was estimated at 50 per cent plus. The construction embodied a cylindrical
expansion chamber plus a baffle placed in a concentric annular space. The baffle was made of a
single strip, helically wound around the chamber, making, in effect, a long unobstructed path.
This device i of the ame type as a number of commercial muffier which have aheady been
more highly developed. It is subject to the di advantages of -weight, ize, and burning out.
A V nturi with throat 0.75 inch diameter and of 2-inch enLrance and exit was tried on the
end of the 2-inch exhaust pipe. The throat size was selected to give a gas velocity greater than
the velocity of sound, in order to prevent the transmi ion of sound from the engine through the
exhaust pipe. The succe s wa undoubted, as there wa no crack. But the veloci yof the gas
in the throat set up an unearthly noise all its own. The expanding portion of the Venturi,
instead of serving as a diverging nozzle, acted as a megaphone. Then the Venturi was tried
with the exhaust first pa ing tluough the 7-inch "whirl chamber" muffler, with somewhat
similar results. The Venturi was al 0 rejected.
The Ford Maxim muffler was found to be a very effective silencer ,,,,hen u ed upon the
Curtiss engine, as well as when u ed on a Ford automobile. On the Curtis engine, handling all
8 cylinder, the power los was rather high compared with ome other device. Con idering the
fact that the muffler was built for a mall engine (the tail pipe was 1 inch diameter), thi is
hardly to be wondered at. The weight of 12 pound was prohibitive.
Throughout the experimental work the G. P. F. 12-inch muffler was u ed as an arbitrary
standard of mu1:lling qualitie. It appears repeatedly in the tables on account of this. While
e timates of noise suppres ion were attempted in absolute values, the final deci ion always re ted
upon relative performance. The "Remarks" of Tables Vn I and IX will illu trate this. The
G. P . F. 12-inch muffler construction, as shown in figure 2 of Report No . 10, i novel. The
baffles, in the form of nozzles, occupy the expan ion chamber. The parts are few and imple.
Surfaces are doubly curved, making for inherent stiffness. The peculiar fact was noted that
this muffler worked equally well with either end as entrance, both as to back pre sure and
silencing. There is a possibility that the internal parts may act as dispersers of the sound waves
by reflection, as well as other ways.
Our attempts to design mufflers, e pecially adapted to airplane use, have followed two
main line. The" manifold" eries of designs use tangential entrance to an annular whirl
chamber, the gases gradually e caping to the central part as they pin. The spin chamber
give the effect of the conventional expansion chamber with a much smaller volume. The
perforated inner tube replaces the baffles, with less weight and back pressure. The objection

INVESTIGATION OF MUFFLING PROBLEM.

145

to the construction is that the inner cylinder may burn out. To avoid this objection the" whirl
chamber" series was designed. The action is essentially the same as the "manifold" type, but
all metal parts are air cooled on one side, and the weight is less. A particular study of the
"whirl chamber" type is given in Tables VI and VII. While making the observations on bark
suppre sion, using the Ingeco engine (Table VI), the tests were made with load, at about 100
explo ions a minute, and with retarded spark to give a vicious bark. The exhaust was flaming
as it is ued from the engine, and gave visual demonstration of the spinning action in the whirl
chamber, and of the gradual emission of gas from the muffler.
Both "manifold" and "whirl chamber" types have a peculiarity that may be advantageous. The exhaust is turned at right angles between the entrn,nce and discharge of the muffler, and with very little back pressure. Roughly, the back pressure is less than when using
an ordinary pipe-fitting elbow. Short tail pipes of diameter equal to the manifolds were tried
upon these types of mufflers, and were found not to affect either silencing or back pressure.
So these mufflers might be placed at the end of a horizontal manifold, and the muffler tail pipe
be carried vertically upward.
The data from the different tables in thi report should not be indiscriminately compared.
The manifolding conditions were frequently changed. In Tables VIII and IX the manifolding
arrangements were the same, apparently, but actually were not constant. The increa ing
vibration of the engine continually shook loose the packing of the joints of the complicated
exhaust line. Leaking of the exhaust from the manifolds became noticeable and evidently
serious. Part of the piping was made of flexible metallic hose, from which the asbestos packing
departed. These troubles make it improper to compare the data of Tables VIII and IX
directly with the other tables, especially in regard to back pressure. However, the small group
of tests, marked off by themselves in these tables, are correct for relative internal comparisons.
To show how these increasing leaks affected back pressure results, the diagrammatic Table X is
given. With the aid of this diagram, applied to the data given in the previous tables, the summing of results as given in Table XI is derived. Power losses are here inferred from the curve
established in plot 2.
It is evident from this table that the" manifold" type of muffler will give good silencing
with power losses less than 1 per cent and with weights comparing very favorably with any
commercial muffler. If minimum weights are desired, the "whirl chamber" type looks most
promising although its silencing action is not as good as the manifold type.
In the" manifold" muffler type the size, shape, location, and total area of the holes in the
inner tube may be varied over a considerable extent. We used a total area of all holes equal
about one-half the area of the exhaust pipe with very good results, and deviations did not alter
the action of the muffler to any great extent, although many small holes probably gave better
muffling without corresponding increase of back pressure. The best construction happened to
have no holes opposite the entering gas, 33 holes VB-inch diameter which the gas first passed,
33 holes -h-inch diameter next, and 33 holes ~ -inch diameter last, just under the nozzle. We
do not lay particular stress upon the size or location, except they shall not be too big.
Taking all the results as shown in plot 10 into consideration, we have recommended, as a
tentative design for the Liberty 12-cylinder engine, the design shown in figure 21. A variant of
this is given in figure 22. Both designs may possibly be improved by the addition of cooling
fins . They are supposed to be placed at the end of an exhaust manifold handling the exhaust
from either six or twelve cylinders. The length of the muffler is to be parallel to the fuselage.
There is no real attempt to stream line the back end of these mufflers for the stream of escaping
exhaust gas is supposed to perfor.QJ. this function . Also any suction at the back end of the
mufflers due to lack of stream lining may be worth its cost. In figure 21 is shown a design in
which air is supposed to pass through the inner tube to some extent, aiding in cooling.
It is possible that very effective silencing could be obtained if the exhaust manifold were
pn,tterned after the design shown in figure 15, in combination with a muffler.
The completion of the solution of the muffling problem can only be accomplished by trials
at fitting manifolds, mufflers, and tail pipes to engines installed in airplanes and in use in actual
flight.

n.-Runs at varying throttle, back pressure conditions fixed.

Back pressure conditions fixed, in the sense that tbe ohstructions to the escape of exhaust gas were unchanged through the series of runs.
However, the baCk pressure changed with engine power output due to chan~e of amount of exhaust gas.
End outlet valve alternately open and closed, relieving or applying the hack pressure.
Power output varied by chan~ing the throttle position. These runs correspond to throttling an en,g:ine loaded 'oy propeller witb the exhaust
escaping through a gi ven m a nifold and mumer.
Data of Aug. 24, 1916, was obtained by forcing (by closing the end outlet valve) the exhaust to leak through the walls of a Hoot len~th of 2!
inches tJexible metallic exhaust hose and the joints of the connections .
Data of Aug. 29, 1916, was a similar set up with fewer leaks.

Louger manifold before mufIler may lower back pressure

worse.
Back pressure same from either part of double set-up showiug that it makes little difference whether gflS goes around

an airrlane passing close overhead. Noise practiraily,

there was an engine somewhere, but the noise would not

APPENDIX A.
FAN DYNAMOMETER DESIGN AND CALIBRATION.

Because of its flexibility and inherent regulation, due to torque varying as square of speed,
and similarity to a propeller , the dynamometer ch osen was the fan type. The general scheme
of design is shown in figure 23. The resistance plates PP are of Tobin bronze plate -h inch
thick. The length, a, of each plate pa.rallel t o the shaft is 14 inches . The radial wid th, b, of
each plate is 10 inches. The plates are fastened to the steel arm, A, which revolves edgewise,
by two angle irons riveted on the back of each plate, and bolted to the arm A . A series of
evenly spaced holes in each end of arm A makes it possible to clamp the plates PP at any desired
distances from the center, making the outside diameters of the plates, Do, adjustable.
The fan shaft is mnul1ted in ball bearings, which are suppor ted by a fr amework built up
of steel angle shapes. This frame is extended, as may be seen in the photogr aph, figm e 1 of the
main body of this report, to carry a rectangular box safety housing of wire mesh screen around
th e fan.

from an engine or motor mounted on a cradle, and the calibration curve so obtained were
available to us and used for our machine, as developed in the following analysis:
To eheck the accuracy of the e calibrations we used the general formula for fan dynamometers, worked out by the White 0 - Poppe Automobile Co., in England, and published in
I\..utom bile Engineer, August, 1910. The formula is quoted in the book on Dynamometer ,
by F. J . Jel'vis- mith, on page 117. It is
a 2R3 foP
np=, 4.01 X 1015
in which a is the ide dimension of a sC]uul'e plate, replacing the a and b of figure 23; R =

~

of

figure 23; and N = r. p. m. Dimensions were in centimeters in getting the constant 4.01 X 10 15
above. We may generalize the formula into
abD OS Ns
HP= 8 X 4.01 X 10 15
for dimensions in centimeters, or

157

INVE TIGATION OF MUFFLING PROBLEM.

for dimensions in inches.

This reduces to

HP = 3.43 X 10- 15 X abD o3X N3.
The formula is stated by White &; Poppe to be valid only if there is no interference with in or
ou t flow of air around the fan . If there is such interference, and less air is handled, the power is
decreased b elow that given by the formula.
T aking the formula as
we checked over the available calibrations of our dynamometer design by finding the valu es of
K for different settings of Do, and trying to account for variations by the expected interference's
with air flow.

The relation of the K value to Do, and of the two calibrations to each other, are shown in
plot 24 . The A. C. A. or Chase calibration seems probably the better, b eing notably more coni tent internally. This may, however , be due to smoothing out of data' b y Cha e, b y crossfairing method. Low value of J( for mall valu e of Do are due to interference with intake
air by the shielding framework around the fan ; small values of K at large valu es of De are due
to interference of the floor and ends of framework w ith discharg0 air.

APPENDIX B.
TESTS OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINE MUFFLERS AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
[R eported in IJorscless Age, May , 1915.'

The e tests were made on a tock Hudson 6-cylinder motor of {Vg-inch bore by 5}4-inch
troke. For the purposes for which we would like to use the data the method of test was unfortunate. Runs were made through the range of tru:ottle positions and speeds without a mumer,
followed by similar sets of runs with the mumer tested. Back pre sures were read with the
muillers. Power losses were inferred by comparison of the runs with and without the illUmer .
As the e runs were somewhat separated in time, power changes due to changes in carburetion,
lubrication, ignition, etc., can not be sorted out from power changes due to the mumer alone.
The muffiers tested were commercial deRigns, five in number.
From the data \\'e have sorted out parts from result on three of the mumer (tho e found
best as silencers), tabulating and plotting their results for our own information. The data
are given in Table XV herewith. Inspection of the table, which may be taken to represent
the state of the art of muilling at the date of 1915, shows how well grounded ,vas the fear that
the muming of airplane engines would be accompanied with prohibitive loss of power. One
commer ial muffler 10 t about 1 per cent and another 14 per cent of the maximum engine
p ower. At the ame time" however, there was hope offered, in that the mallest and lighte t
muffler tested gave the be t silencing a:r:J.d also the least power loss-only 3.6 per cent of ~he
maximum engine power. This mumer weighed 14 pounds for a 40-hor epower motor, or 0.35
pounds per horsepower. We have now obtained, by contra t, excellent muming on a 70horsepower motor at a power los less than 1 per cent and with a weight of 5 or 6 pound (less
than O. 9 pounds per horsepower).

Muffler Y, besides giving the least back pressure and power loss, was the least in weight
and size, and the best in silencing ability.
A partial analysis of the University of Michigan data is given in plot 25, showing the losses
of brake M. E. P. as a function of back pressure at various speeds. At the right of plot 25
the curves for the three speeds are combined. The resultant grouping is comparable with
Table II and plot 11 of the main body of this report. (Note that in plot 11 back pressures are
in inches of mercury and in plot 25 in pounds per square inch.) The conclusions there reached
are confu'med, at least qualitatively, from this independent source.
Plot 26 shows the back pressures due to the mufflers as a function of power output of the
engine. It is similar to plots 7 and 12 of the main report. Plot 27 presents the same data in
logarithmic plotting, just as plot 8 reproduces plot 7. The suggestion that back pressure
varies as about the 1.5 power of the output of the engine is checked .
It does not seem quite true, however, that back pressure depends, for anyone muffler and
engine, solely on power output. The back pressure (and per cent power loss) is higher when

the power is obtained by small throttle opening and high speed than by large throttle opening
and low speed. It should be remembered, however, that in the discussion of muffler capacity
we have pointed out that some muffiers in our own tests did not increase back pressure when
the number of cylinders exhausting into the muffler was doubled. Other muffiers did increase

be expecLed from ordinary flow laws. It seems probable that the differences between the
curves for muffier D in plot 26 for speeds of 1,300, 1,000, and 750 r. p. m. are largely tied up
with its having b en a poor muffler design (in respect of power 10 ) and that such a dillerence
would show much less with the better mufflers of our later tests.

R ESUME.

This report describes a method developed at the Bureau of tandards [or measuring tbe
total energy liberated as heat in a spark gap by an ignition sy tern. Since this heat energy
is obtained [rom the electro~rnagnetic energy stored in the 'Yindings of tbe magneto or coil,
it is a measure of the e[ectivene s of the device as an electric generator. It must be borne in
mind, however, that this total energy is by no means a measure of the igniting po,'-er of the
spark.
Use is made o[ a hollow block of copper and the sparks to be measured are passed between
nickel alloy terminals in a cavity in the interior of tbe block. The heat liberated rai es the
temperature of the chamber and this temperature rise is measured by a copper-constantan
thermocouple and a galvanometer. The apparatus is calibrated by sending a kno'wn current
through a heating coil inclosed in the cavity. Measurements reliable to 5 per cent can be
obtained in about 15 minutes as the apparatus is u uully operated. The run cun be shortened
to £i,e minutes w'ith some sacrifice of accuracy. A gap length 2.1 mm . (0.0 2 inch ) between
terminals 1.5 mm . (0.06 inch ) in diameter i used, as this makes the breakdown voltage and
duration of the spark substantially the equivalent of that occurring in nn aviation engme
cylinder.
I TRODUCTION.

The method for the measurement of energy dissipated in ignition sparks which i described
in thi report was developed at the Bureau of Standards as a part of the ignition in,c tigation.
It is recognized that this total heat energy is by no means a mea ure of the igniting pmyer of
a sp~rk, since the latter is affocted by many othor factors. The value of this measure as an
indicator of magneto performance arises from the fact that the energy which is liberated in
the park gap is derived from the electro-magneti energy stored in the magneto or coil, and
the amount of this energy is to that extent a measure of the effectiveness of the appar·atus
as an electric generator.
Calorin1etric method for mea uring thi energy ha,e the advantages of greater simplicity
and freedom from the many sources of error which are liable to enter into purely electrical
methods of measuring power uncleI' the extreme conditions of 1
1igh voltage and di storted wave
forms which occur in ignition circuits. The u e of a copper block form of calorimeter avoids
the inconvenience of liquid calorimeters and ha been found very satisfactory for this as well
as many other lines of work. In common with other calorimeter measurements, the results
can be conveniently expressed in ab oluie units and may therefore be compared with results '
obtained b'y other observer with different methods .

DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS.

The calorimeter itself consists of a hollow copper block, as shown in figure 1, approximately
3.5 cm. (1.4 inches) in diameter and 5.5 cm. (2.2 inches) long, containing a cavity in the
center. The spark to be measured occurs between. the grounded electrode 0 and a high
potential electrode B, the latter being insulated from the chamber by a small glass bushing.
These electrodes are fitted with nickel alloy terminals 1.5 mm. (0.06 inch) in diameter, for
most wOI'k set to give a spark gap of 2.1 mm. (0.082 inch). This gap may be varied, if
desired, by the micrometer adjustment of the grounded terminal.
The effect of 'e xternal temperature changes is compensated for by the use of a dummy
.
copper block, E (figure 2), which is similar to the working calorimeter but contains no spark
gap, and is placed symmetrically with respect to the working chamber inside of a double-walled
wooden box. This box is lined with sheet copper in order to insure uniform temperature
over its entire surface. A copper-con tan tan thermocouple has one junction imbedded in
each of the blocks and by means of a Leeds & Northrup type 2,400 galvanometer serves to
indicate the difference in temperature between the two blocks. The ab olute temperature of
either block is immaterial and is not measured. The gah-anometer which has a sensitivity
of 5 microvolts per divi ion and a resistance of 190 ohms has been found very satisfactory for
this purpose.
METHODS OF USE.

tarting with the two blocks at the same temperature the park is pa ed in block A for two
minutes and the magneto is then stopped for one minute to allow the temperatures to equalize.
A t the end of this third minute, the galvanometer is read and the magneto again started for
another period of two minutes continuous run. This proce is continued until five or ix
readings have been obtained. These galvanometer deflections are then plotted again t time,
giving a curve similar to the ones shown in plot 4. This curve i then uperposed on the set
of similar curves obtained at the original calibration of the in trument, and of which plot
3 is an example, and the average watts corresponding to the observed curves are read off directly.
The heat energy per spark is then computed from the formula
watts X 60
.
Joules per spark = sparks per rev. Xl'. p. m.
Before starting a second measurement, it is neces ary to cool the chamber A to the
temperature of the block B, but this is quite easily done by moistening it with alcohol and
allowing this to evaporate.
The advantages of this somewhat complex system are that a number of galvanometer
readings are obtained so that the l' sults are not vitiated by a single error in reading, and the
pauses b tween runs ensure that the temperatures are fairly equalized throughout the block.
The time for the entire run is approximately 15 minutes . In cases where the dis i1 ation of
power is in excess of five watts, it is more convenient to use a cycle consisting of one minute
running and one minute equalization.
It is, of course, possible to make a single continuous run of 5 or 10 minutes' duration and
take a single galvanometer reading at the end of that time, and accuracy of 10 per cent or
better can be obtained with such a procedure. It is al 0 probable that apparatus of thi
general type might be constructed with mercury thermometer instead of a thermo ouple
and thereby avoid the necessity of using a sensitive galvanometer.
CALIBRATION.

The calorimeter is calibrated by the u e of a coil of re istance wire, which is shown in
figure 1. A known amount of enery is dissipated in this coil using the same cycle of operation
as is done in measuring the spark energy and the curves of galvanometer deflection against
ince the heat is added aL the ame rate as in the actual
time are plotted as in plots 3 and 4.
operaLion, thi method of calibration eliminate any error due to 10. of heat from the
calorimet 1". The calorimeter has approximately a heat capacity equal to that of 40 grams
of water, 0 that the temperature rise corresponding to 1,000 joules is about 6° C.

SOURCES OF ERROR.

As mentioned above, the heat losses from the calorimeter are compensated for by the use
of the dummy chamber and the method of calibration. Another possible source of error is
conduction of heat through the high-tension lead which is thermally insulated 'from the block
by the' glass bushing. Thi has been investigated by making use of the fact that if sparks
of the same polarity are repeatedly passed through a gap, one electrode becomes much hotter
than the other. Measurements were made on a system giving this constant polarity, both
with the high-tension electrode as anode and later as a cathode, and no difference in average
energy was detected. This indicates that the heat loss through the high-tension lead, even
when the high-tension terminal is much hotter than it becomes with alternating sparks, causes
no appreciable enor.
The passage of the spark through the air causes a formation of oxides of nitrogen and
nitric acid in the chamber which have some tendency to corrode the interior. Computations,
however, show that the energy involved in these chemical reactions is entirely negligible in
comparison with the heat energy dissipated. The change in volume of the gas, due to this
chemical reaction, does not enter into the measurements with this apparatus as it does when
an air thermometer is used.
The standard length of gap 2.1 mm. (0.082 inch) was chosen for this work because measurements with a crest voltmeter showed it to havc the same breakdown voltage as that of an
average spark plug in a high-compression engine cylinder . What is still more important, the
voltage drop acro s the term.inals while the spark continues to pass is also substantially the same
as that occurring in an engine. This sustaining voltage is the principal factor in determirring
the rate of dissipation of energy and, consequently, the duration of the spark. Since the voltages above mentioned were measured with the gap in continuous operation, they include the
effect of any accumulated ionization in the chamber, and therefore the fact that the gap is not
ventilated is not an objection, but is, indeed, essential to the measurements for only under
these conditions are the initial and sustaining voltages of the calorimeter gap the same as
those obtaining in the average aviation engine.
It is believed that the results obtained with this apparatus and procedure may be relied
upon to 5 per cent, and after the apparatus is once calibrated a determination can be made in
about 15 minutes.
TYPICAL RESULTS.

Plot 5 gives a typical curve of the results obtained by this method on a shuttle core
magneto at different speeds . The particular curve shown represents the performance of a
Bosch Type Z- H- 6 taken from a captured German airplane, and is quite similar to other highgrade magnetos. Battery systems usually give less heat, ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 joules
per spark.

RESUME.

Tile duty of an ignition syst.em is Lo produce definitely and reliably in the engine cylinder
spark suIfLCiently energetic to cau e the rapid and certain comhu Lion of the explosive mixture.
Tills report gives the results of direct mea urements in absolute units of the total heat
supplied to a spark gap by ignition systems of different lypes operating at various speeds uncler
conditions sub tantially equivalent to tho e in the cylincler of a high-compression a,iation
engine. Values ranging from 0.16 joules (0 .00015 B. t. u.) per spark in the more powerful
ma~netos to O . O~ joules (0.00003 B. t. u. ) in the case of a battery system are recorded.
The actual igniting power of a spark depends on many factors which arc at present little
understood, and the total heat energy is by no means a direct measure of this igniting power.
It Joes, howe,er, give an index of the total power output of each type of machine, and form ' a
basis for a study of the eirect of various features of design upon this output. Besides the
systematic data given in the curves on plots 1 to 16, inclusive, and T,lble 1, additional measurements were made which sho,\-ed that a condenser connected in parallel with tbe spark gap
did not affect the heat liberated. The heat was also found to be independent of the gap length
until this become .0 short that the spark la t until the clo ing of the breaker. For st.ill shorter
gap the heat di 'ipatell becomes less.

INTRODUCTION.

When a spark discharge from an induction coil or high-tension magneto pa ses through a
gas, a very appreciable amount of electrical energy is liberate(l which is rapidly clissipated as
heat in the gas and to some extent in the electrodes. This heat enero-y is deriyed from the
electromagnetic energy tored in the windings before the pa age of t.he . park and the amount.
of thi energy is to that extent a mea ure of the efi'ecti,enes of Lhe device as an elect.ric o-enerator. Very little is lmown as to the detailed sequence of events hy whi.ch the ga' is ignited,
and it is undetermined whether the ionization , which is always present, is an essential factor
or whether the process i merely a thermal eirect. due to the high temperature resulting from
tbe rapid di ipation of a relatively large alllount of energy in a small pace.
Recent. experiments m(lieate that tbe toLal amount of energy required to explode a ga eous
mixture (approximately 0.003 joules) is mucb less tban that supplied by e\'en a very weak
igllition system of t.he conventional type. It is pl'ohable, ho·wever, that cases of faulLy carburetion, where drops of fuel mus t be yaporizecl by the spark, require a di charge of vpry appreciable heat content . . In such cases the larger volume and the longer duration of the hotter
spark are also of \~alue .
Tills report contains the re ' ult of calorimetric measurements of the energy content of
the sparks produced under standard conditions by various types of ignition systems. The data

are of value both as a general index of the power of each machine for comparative purposes
and also as a basis for the more complete study of the effects of various features in de ign upon
the delivered energy of a magneto.
Reg lar runs were made on 15 magnetos and one battery system for total energy output,
the energy being measured on a specially construcLeu calorimeter de cribed in a later paragraph.
Observations were taken on the magnetos at speeds up to 3,500 revolutions per minute. Preliminary measurements have also been carried out to determine the effect of spark length and
other variables on the total energy.
METHOD.

The calorimeter u ed i fully described in Part I of thi report and consists chiefly of two
hollow copper bombs of approximately the arne shape and volume, suspended by means of
hard rubber posts in a dead-air space. The spark is made to pass between nickel alloy spark
points in the interior of one bomb and the rate of rise of temperature of this bomb over the
other i measured by means of a thermocouple and galvanometer. Previous calibration with
a known heater re i tance and dire~t ClUTent provides means for determining the constant of
the apparatus.
In the regular runs a standard park length of 2.1 mm. (0.0 2 inch) between flat surfaces
l.5 mm. (0.059 inch) in diameter was used. This gap \vas chosen because it was found by
mea urement to have the same breakdo\vn voltage (about 6,000 volts) as that of a 0.5 mm.
(0.020 inch) <Yap between spark-plug electrodes in a high-compre ion aviation engine. Furthermore the voltage required to suotain the arc acro s the e electrodes is approximately the ::;ame
as that of an opemting plug. Consequently the rate of di. sipation of energy and the duration
of the spark are sub tantially the same as in actual practice. A more detailed description of
this method is given in Part I or thi report.
REGULAR RUNS.

The principal feature of each of the systems tested are tabulated in 'fable I, and the
observed values of heat energy are plotted agaimlt magneto-driving haft speed in plots 1 00
16, inclusive. Where the magnetos were provided with variable spark po ition, the mea urements were made at full advance. The data from these plots are smnmarized in Table II.
Column III gives the average joules per spark over the range from 500 to 2,500 revolutions
per minute of the magnetos; column IV gives the maximum joules per spal'k, and column V
the speed at which thi maximum occur; column VI gives the joules per spark at the speed
requil. ed for operating at 1,500 revolutions per minute a 4-cycle engine of the number of cylinders
for which the magneto i de igned; column VII gi ves the joules per spark at the speed at 'which
the system is delivering 100 sparks per second.

I Corresponding magneto speed, 3,000 revolutions per mjnute.
• Corresponding magneto speed, 1,500 revolutions per minute .
• Corresponding distributor speed, 500 revolutions per minute.

It will be noticed that all the curves, with the exception of the Liberty battery and coil
ignition set, have the the same general characteristic shape, rising rapidly to a maximum value
at some low speed-generally between 750 and 1,000 revolutions per minute-then slowly
decreasing toward higher speeds. In practically every case a peculiar bend in the curve, which
is shown very markedly in plot I, is evident.
The energy curve of the Liberty coil (plot 14) starts with its highest value at a very low
speed and remains constant up to about 140 revolutions per minute. At higher speeds the
primary current does not have time to build up to its maximum value, which causes a decrease
in total energy as the speed is increased. In order to give a better comparison the coil system
curve is replotted as a dotted line to correspond to the speed of rotation of a four-spark magneto.
(The coil as operated gave 12 sparks per revolution.)
SPECIAL RUNS.

Several different runs were made on typical magnetos to determine the effect of (a) type
of distributor; (b) condenser added to primary circuit; (c) large number of secondary turns;
(d) length of spark gap; (e) added secondary capacity.

REPORT No. 57.
THE SUBSIDIARY GAP AS A MEANS FOR IMPROVING IGNITION.1
By W. S.

GORTON.

RESUME.

This report was prepared at the Bureau of tandards for the ational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.
Additional or subsidiary gaps have frequently been used in jump-spark ignition systems,
in order to cause the resumption of sparking in fouled spark plugs. The series gap, to which
the greater part of this report is devoted, is a subsidiary gap in the connection between the
high tension terminal of the plug and that of the magneto or coil. A brief account is given
of the use of thi gap up to the present time and also of the statements concerning it which have
gained some currency, mo t of which are shown to be erroneous. The simple theory of the action
of the .series gap is di cussed and a detailed account given of the effect upon the sparking ability
of the plug produced by changes in the values of the electrical resistance of the fouling and of
the capacities in parallel with the plug and with the magneto or coil. Experiments confirm
the main features of the simple theory. The points of difference between the conditions as
postulated in the simple theory and the conditions actually existing are enumerated and their
bearing upon the design and operation of the series gap discussed. The ensuing section is
devoted to a discussion of tJ:le design of series gaps.
It is concluded that the series gap may be u ed as a remedy for a considerable part of
the trouble due to the fouling of plugs which is met with in practice, since it has been found
po ible by the use of a eries gap on an ayernge ignition system to park a plug having a
fouling resistance of only 4,000 ohm .
INTRODUCTION.

The spark plugs used on internal combustion engines employing the jump- park sy tem
of ignition are subject to many ills. At pre ent the chief of these is the fouling of the plugs
with carbon and oil, which are deposited on the surface of the insulation forming a conducting
path between the electrodes of the plug. The resistance of this path frequently falls ,so low
that sparks will no longer pass between the electrodes. It has been found that, under these
conditions, modification of the ignition system involving the use of an additional spark gap,
or gaps, will cau e parks to pass again between the electrodes. Such spark gaps are called
subsidiary gaps and the use of them will be di cussed in this report.
Some of the ignition y terns employing subsidiary gaps have been of de igns radically
different from those ordinarily u ed. IIi the majority of ca e , however, the u e of a subsidiary
gap has involved merely the insertion of a gap in the connection between the high-tension
terminal of the magneto or coil and that of the park plug. Such a ub idiary gap is called a
series gap, and it i with this gap as opposed to the other varietie of subsidiary gaps that this
report principally deals.
The series gap has been made in many form. and employed in n umerous way. A large
number of claim, frequently of an extravagant character, have been made in its favor, while
there have al 0 been objection raised against the use of such device.
The purpo e of this report i to make available, in a form convenient for reference, the more
important information concerning series gaps, anI to state what may reasonably be expected

(A)

PAST A D PRE E T STATE OF THE ART.

In the automobile field racing clriyer have long used the eries gap for improying the
ignition f their car . In its original form it con i ted imply of a block of wood fa icned (0
the spark plug. To tbis block was attached the high ten ion lead in uch fashion that there
was a mall gap between the end of the wire and the terminal on ihe in ulated electrode of th
spark plug.
Recently variou commercial fonn of the serie gap, u ually intended ror attachment to
standard spark plugs, have appeared. Tho e of American manufacture that ha\e come to
the attention of thi bureau are as follows: (a) Ma tel', (b) peco, (c) uper park, (d) Walden

The Lodge system is the best known of these sy tems and will be described briefly. It co n i ts
simply of one or two condensers which are charged by the magneto or coil, and which discharge
across a subsidiary gap, called by the inventor the" primary gap." The spark plug is included
in the discharge circuit of the condensers and a spark takes place between the electrodes . The
circumstances governing the passage of the spark are identical WIth those described later in the
discussion of the action of the serie gap.
fan y advantages have been claim d for the erie gap and ome objections ha\e been urgecl
again t it . The former arc more num0rou than the latter and orne of them are 0 extreme in

SUBSIDIARY GAP AS A MEANS FOR IMPllOVING IGNITION.

(b) Ohjections urged:

1. I-lard on insulation of ignition system.
2. Causes large drain of cun:ent.
3. Causes difficulty in starting.
The experimental and oLher evidence on the questions above enumerated will now be
di"cus ed.
(a) ADVAKTAGES CLAIMED .

o. 1 is o~viously not true. It is, of com e, unqu estioned that plugs can sometimes be Crred by means of a series gap when they can not be fired without it, but the ability of
the series gap to fire a fouled 01' otherwise damage d plug depen~s entirely upon the value of the
r esistance shunting the plug gap . If this hunting resistance r eac hes a sufficiently low value
it may become impossible to fIre the plug. For the average spark plug and magneto this limiting
value of resistance is of the order of magnitude of several thousand ohms. Fouling with a
resistance of this order of magnitude is of not infrequent occmren e.
(2) The usc of a series gap may result in incr eased power, speed, and economy, as claimed,
but, as far as our present knowledge goes, only indir·ectly . The irlcr ease in magnitude of the
quantities named results solely from the fact that the use of the series gap may cause to be
fIred charges of the explosive mixtm e which otherwi e would be discharged from the engine
unignited. The chtim of increased power, speed and economy as frequcntly made is that the
use of the series gap will bring about the result mentioned even though ever y ch arge was being
fired by the engine without the use of the gap . This claim has been investigated experim,entally
at the Bureau of Standards and found to he unjustified. Experiment were made on both a
truck an d ,an aviation engine in which a commercial form of the series gap was attached to
eac h plug. A switch at each plug was provided, whereby the series gap could be short circuited
at will. It was found that the running of the engine, and the consumption of gasoline, wa
entir'ely unaffccted by the presence or absence of the series gaps through the 'wide range of
mixtures, loads, and spark advance used. Experiments to determine whether the chara tel' of
the spark discharge in the engine cylinder afieci,e 1 the running of the engine were also made.
A condenser was connected through a switch to the terminals of a spark plug on one of the cylinders of an automobile engine. The con den. er could be connected to or disconnected from the
plug at 'will, thus modifyirlg the char acter of the sp ark discharge in the eJ;girle cylinder ma.rkedly.
~ 0 difference in the running of the engine could be detected whether the conden er was disconnected from the plug or connected to it. Additional experiments on this point, the r esults
of which have come to the attention of this bnreau, justify the conclusion that the character of
the igniting di charge has no effect whn.tever on the running of the engine so long a th e spark
ignite the explosive mixture.
(3) The claim that the use of a series gap re ults in a tlfatter ," hotter spark is of mmor
importance, as it has by no means been shown that increa ing the tI fatne s)) of a park increases
its igniting powel'. Some experinlents were made at this bureau with a plug artificially fouled
and a series gap, which sho\yed that whenever the spark passed its appearance was the same,
whether there was a seribS gap present or not, or whether the plug wa clean or fouled . The
temperature of the spark i a very indefinite thing an I little can now be as elted as to the
magnitude of that quantity. The heat generated by the passage of the i3park, however, can
easily be measured. Inve tigation at the Bureau of tandarcls h ave shown that this lastmentioned quantity is in general reduced by the presence of the series gap . Whether or not
this redu ction in the total energy content of the park involves a decrea e in the igniting power
of the spark is not now known.
(4) The ratio of the amounts of energy spent in the plug gap and eries gap i equal to the
ratio of the sustaining voltages of the r espective gaps. The sustaining voltage of the series
gap is of the same order of m agnitude as that of the plug gap. Consequently the amount of
energy 10 t in the series gap is not negligible.
(5) The experimental eviden ce obtained up to the pre ent time shows that the character
of the spark ha no effect on the speed of propagation of the explo ion. As mentioned above,
experiments on an engine showed that the presence of neither the eries gap ~lor a condenser

made the least difference in the power developed or speed attained. Con equently the effect,
if any, of the presence of the series gap upon the speed of propagation of the explosion is too
.
small to afrect the power d e v e l o p e d . '
(6) It has been asserted by the prop0nent of the eries gap that this device is in effect a
"window in the cylinder" and that the pa age of a spark in the series gap indicates infallibly
the passage of a spark between the electrodes of the plug. This is not the case. Not infrequently plugs are so badly fouled that the breakdown of the serie gap fails to fire them . Moreover, the passage of a spark across the series gap does not indicate thereby a healthy condition
of the ignition system unle s the series gap is set for a breakdown voltage equal to or greater
than that of the plug.
(7) The use of a leaner miiture when the series gap is employed is due not to the series gap
itself but to the fact that upon installing such devices a readjustment of the carburetor is generally made. Many owners of motor cars run with too rich a mixture, and a readju tment of
the carburetor in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer of the series gap results
in a leaner mixture.
( ) Readings taken with a direct-current ammeter in series with a clean plug have ahown
that the presence of a series gap reduces the current as indicated by the instrument. 'l"he
oscillograph, however, shows that the pre ence of the series gap ha no efreet other than to
decrease the duration of the di charge between thc electrodes of the plug. Thi i due to
the higher su taining voltage of the combination of plug and series gaps which causes the
current ill them to stop ooner than it otherwise would. The presence of the series gap does
not affect the value of the current 'while it is flowing. Consequently it is readily een that
the indication of a direct-current ammeter in the circuit will be deCl'eased by the presence of
a senes oap. This fact i probably the basis for the claim that the series gap reduces the
" amperage."
Concerning the effect of the presence of serie gaps upon the life of the breaker points little
can now be said. The value of the current flowtng through the breaker before the points open'
i probably in mo t ca es not afrected by the pre ence of the series gap. When it is affected,
the effect is to increase the value of this current. This is due to the fact, mentioned in the
previous paragraph, that when the series gap is used the current in the secondary of the magneto
or coil dies out more rapidly than' when no series gap is present. Consequently there is less
chance of interference between the last part of one discharge and the beginning of the next,
with a resulting decrease in the value of the primary current when the breaker opens. The
previous sentence is applicable only to the magneto. In the cas~ of the coil operated from a
battery, interference rarely if ever takes place.
The above discussion applies to the case of a gap in erie with a clean plug. If the gap is in
ser~es with a fouled plug, the comparison has to be made between the action of the fouled plug
alone and the fouled plug in conjunction with the series gap. Oscillograms have been taken
which show that the current in the primary at break, if no series gap is present, is in general
the ame whether the plug i clean or fouled. If there is any differe~ce between the two cases
it is that the primary current is greater when the plug is fouled. It was seen in the preceding
paragraphs that the addition of a series gap increases the voltage acro s the breaker points,
and may sometimes increase the primary curren.t at break. Con equently it would be eA"pected
that there would be a decrease in the life of the breaker points upon the addition of a series
gap in circuit with a fouled plug. Experimental evidence on this point, however, is lacking
at present.
(9) The u e of a series gap may increase the amotmt of energy available for ignition only
in the sense that it may cause a spark to pass between the electrodes of a plug when without
it the spark would not pass. If the spark i going to pa s at all, it will pass in such a short ·
time after the opening of the breaker that a negligible amount of energy is lost in that time in
the fouling. During the passage of the spark its resistance is small compared with that of the
fouling, and consequently the fouling has little effect on the fUl:ther course of the discharge.
If the spark does not pass, the energy that would otherwise be expended in the spark is dissipated
in the fouling.

(b) OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE USE OF SERIES GAPS.
(1) The series gap in an ignition system can not be set for a breakdown voltage less t.han
that of the plug if the device is to be of any use. Consequently, the breakdovvn voltage of the
combination of series and plug gaps will, in general, be greater than that of the plug gap alone.
This state of affairs is not considered to be necessarily detrimental, as the insulation of t.he
magneto or coil is supposed to be able to stand, for long periods of time, a potential equal to
the breakdown potential of the safety gap. There is a possibility however, that the continued
application of this higher potential mn.y, in the end, weaken the insulation. Experimental
evidence on this point is lacking at the present time.
(2) Experimental evidence on the claim that the use of a series gap causes a large" drain
of current" has already been presented under section (a) 8 above. It was shown there that the
series gap has but little effect on the currents in the various circuits.
(3) There is some evidence to ahow that the presence in an ignition system of a series gap,
at least one of fi.xed length, may cause difficulty in starting the engine. A case was reported
to this bureau in which a series gn.p of variable length was used on a t.ruck engine. After the
engine had' run for a minute or dO, it would continue to run satisfactorily over a ",ride range of
settings of the series gap, from zero up to a maximum length; but, in starting, the series gap
had to be entirely closed in order to get the engine to fire. In this case the plugs could not ha e
been very dirty.
In experiments carried out at this bureau on a SImilar engine with artificially fouled plugs,
it WfI.S found t.hat the series gap had to be opened wide in order to start but had to be closed
somewhat afterwards in order to fire steadily. The interpretation of the phenomena just
described is not certain; but there can be no doubt that, in some cases, the presence of a series
gap in the circuit is detrimental in atarting. The conclusion is that series gaps should be made
so that their length can be adjusted easily at any time during the running of the engine.
(B) OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACTION OF SERIES GAPS.
SIMPLE TIJEOl"!.Y OF TJ-JE ACTIO

OF THE SERIES GAP, AND RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS MADE TO
TEST THE THEORY.

N oTE.-Reference may be made to Report No. liS, Part I, for a more detailed discussion of the cycle of operations of a magneto or coil.

The outline of what takes place during the cycle of operations of a magneto or coil can be
given in a few words andw1ll be summarized in the follov.ring paragntph .
The first of the periods into which the cycle of operations can be divided is that just before
the opening of the breaker when the current in the primary is increasing due to the action of
the electromotive force of the battery in the case of a coil, or that due to rotation in the case
of a magneto.
The second of the periods is that in which the voltage builds up after the opening of the
breaker. Before the breaker opens current is flowing in the coil. When the breaker opens the
circuit this current decreases rapidly, in so doing charging the condenser and inducing an
E. M. F. in the secondary. If the gap did not break down, this would go on until all the energy
was electrostatic in form; but in general the gap breaks dovro before this stage is reached. Any
arcing at the break lessens the rate of change of current, and so lessens the maximum voltage
attained during thi period.
When the discharge first begins to flow between the electrodes in the plug, it probably
consi ts of a condenser discharge; that is, the capacity of the high tension winding discharges
through the plug gap and the course of the discharge is much too fast for the ordinary oscillograph to record. This state, however, lasts only for a very short time, and then the discharge
a
becomes a steady arc with approximl tely constant sustaining voltage. The effect of capacity
in parallel v.rith the plug, in particular the capacity of the leads and any apparatus connected
to them, is to decrease the rate of rise of the E. M. F. a,nd also the maximum value attained
by it. If there are any dielectric losses in the insulating materials of the system, the same effect,
that is, decreased rate of rise of the E. M. F. and smaller value of maximum voltage, v.rill be
produced.

The phenomenon de cribed in the preceding paragraph applies to the case where the in-

sulation re istance of the plug is high. If the plug is fouled, the insulation 1'e istance is greatly
decreased and the cycle of operation is somewhat different . The effect of this re i tance
hunting the plug gap is to decf(~a e the yalLle of the maximum voltage by diverting to the
fouling energy which woull otherwi 'e go Lo charging the capacity in parallel with the plug.
Another way of interpreting the phenomenon is that the fouling diYert to it elf current that
would otherwi e charge the capacity in parallel with the plug and iucrease the yoltage. The
potential diil'erence acro s the plug at any time mu t neco arily equal the ohmic drop in the
fouling and can not be Ie s than the breakdown yoltage of the plug if the pluO" i to fire the

ep is greater than Ep. The effect of varying the different con tants of the circuit is easily seen
as follows:
A decrease in R obviously decreases the ability of the system to fire the plug due to the
increased amount of charge which flows through the resistance and decreases the potential Of
Op. To offset such an effect an increase .in ep is required. As can be readily een by reference to equation (1), this can be brought about by an increase in am or E., or both. An increase in R cau es the rever e effect. If R is large (of the order of 100 megohms) the condenser
Op is virtually insulated instead of being short circuited by R. Under these conditions, the
voltage across Op and as, before any spark passes, are respectively

Each of these voltages is smaller than em. Consequently, if a plug is clean, the applied
voltage em required to spark the combination of plug and serie gaps may be larger than if the
plug is fouled, provided the resistance of the fouling is not too low.
It is seen from equation (1) that an increase in Op causes a decrease in ep; consequently,
it i in general advantageous to keep the capacity in parallel with the plug as small as po sible.
The one exception to this statement is for the case when the plug is clean. Under these conditions, it i seen from expres ion (3) that the voltage across the series gap increase with Op,
and therefore that the series gap will discharge more easily, the larger is Op. An increase in
Op, however, makes the plug gap harder to fire, consequently Op can not be increased beyond
a certain limit without causing the plug to stop firing.
The capacity in parallel with the serie gap has little effect on the operation of the system.
During the discharge the pre ence of this capacity increases the current through the series gap.
This increa e in current causes an increase in the ionization in the series gap and consequently
a slight decrea e in the resistance of the series gap. If the plug is fouled, the capacity as is in
parallel with am when the condensers are being charged and hence decreases slightly the maximum voltage furnished by the magneto or coil.
The effect of increasing am i seen from equation (1) to increase the voltage applied to the
plug when the series gap breaks down. Can equently from this standpoint a large value of
am i beneficial. However, increasing am decreases the maximum value of the potential furnished by the magneto, and so if am is increa ed too much the magneto will no longer be able
to spark the plug gap.
Variou experiments, made to test the "bove outlined theory of the action of the serie gap,
have come to the attention of this bureau. Some were made on plugs fouled by u e in an engine
and some on clean plug shunted by a water resistance. Other experiments, in tead of being
carried out on a spark plug, were carried out on a gap con isting of a wire going through a holo
in 0, plate. In all three cases, the ub idiary gap wa a ball gap. The value of the hunting
re istanco in the last ca e was 10,000 ohm. The results of the experiments confirm the main
features of the theory; that is, the change in the sparking ability of the system due to change
in the capacity and resistance of the various parts follow the requirements of the theory, with
the exception of some anomalies which were ascribed to the oscillatory character of the di charge of the series (Yap. Evidence was also found that the actual fouling ha a much lower
re istance at high voltages than it has at low voltages, as though the conduction at high potentials were in the nature of arcs .passing from particle to particle of the fouling. One of the most
important conclusions reached was that the length of the series gap nece sary to fire a foul d
plug is extremely variable, and con oquently any series gap used on an engine should be capable
of easy adjustment while the engine is running.
The experimental evidence obtained at the Bureau of Standards, whic~ need not be given
in detail here, also confirms all the lll.jl.in features of the theory. One point worthy of note is
that it was found possible to fire a plug in an engine when the resistance of the fouling, as
measured by a megger, was as low as 4,000 ohms.

DIFFEREtWE BETWEEN THEOR): AND ACTUAL CONDITIONS IN THE OPERATION OF SERIES GAPS.

In discussions of the action of the series gap many ~ondition are frequently postulated
for simplicity, either direct ly or by implication, which do not correspond to actual facts. These·
points of difference between the simple theory and actual conditions will be treated in detail in
the following paragraphs a they must be con idered in dealing with the que tion of series gaps.
The first point for discussion is the question of the potential given by a magneto or coil.
It is generally asserted that this potential is eldom or never the same from one cycle of operations to the next. This statement has frequently come to the attention of this bureau. A
justificat ion given for this statement is that when a magneto or coil is sparking a gap, the
maximum voltage as read by a crest voltmeter (a static voltmeter in series with a kenotron)
is always varying; and also that at certain times the system is able to spark a longer gap
than it is at others. These facts, however, could be just as well, or rather better, accounted
for by a variation in the breakdown voltage of the gap instead of in the potential htrnished by
the magneto or coil. Experiments to te t this point were made at. the Bureau of tandards.
A magneto driven by. belt from a motor was connected directly to a crest voltmeter, no
spark gap except the afety spark gap of the magneto being in the circuit. At first it was run
at approximately 300 revolutions per minute, the speed of the magneto at any instant being
rather ariable. The safety gap did not discharge at all. The voltage as read by the crest
voltmeter was constant to within 1 per cent. The peed was then increa ed. A a consequence
it was nece sary to connect a condenser to the terminals of the magneto in order to prevent
the safety gap from discharging. The voltage was even more constant than at the lower
speeds; and, in fact, up to the highe t speed employed in the experiment (1,600 revolutions
per minute) the higher the speed the more con tant the reading of the crest voltmeter. Conditions at speeds greater than 300 revolutions per minute, where a cond nser had to be connected t o the terminals of the magneto, are not quite comparable with conditions existing
when the magneto is firing a gap; but at 300 revolutions per minute where no condenser was
used they are directly comparable with the conditions of actual use. The experiment was tried
of measuring the voltage with acre t vol tmeter when the magneto was firing a gap at 300
revolutions per minute. The reading of the voltmeter was extremely variable. These facts
show cOD,clusively that any variation in the power of a magneto to spark a gap is due to variability i the gap rather than in the magneto.
The next point to be considered is the variability of parking potential of the series gap
due to one or more of the cau es now to be discu sed. It is a well-e tablished fact that any
change in the surface of ' the electrodes of a park gap in general changes the sparking
potential. In particular the long-continued p~ssage of a discharge corrodes the surface, furni bing numerous points from which the discharge can pass, and increases the distance between
the electrodes. These two varieties of change in surface conditions have opposite effects.
The roughening of the surface makes the spark pas at 'a smaller value of the potential, and
the increase in distance makes the spark pass at a higher potential. The total effect is probably first a slight decrease and then an increase in the sparking potential.
The temperature of the electrodes also has an effect on the breakdown voltage. If the
electrode are hot, the temperature of the gas b tween the electrode is increased, and consequently the breakdown voltage of the gap i deCl'eased if the gap is in communication with
the atmosphere. If the gap is hermetically sealed, a variation in the temperature of the
ga has no effect on the breakdown voltage. A further effect of an in rease in the temperature
of the electrodes is to change the nature of the surface flims upon them. In general, an increase
III temperature tends to dissipate the surface films , which have such a marked effect, usually
inhibitory, on the passage of a discharge between the electrodes.
The medium in which the electrodes of the series gap are immersed i subject in general
to changes in :Qature, pressure, and temperature. The only case in which a change in nature
is to be expected is when the gap is tightly inclosed>. Under these conditions the passage of
a discharge causes chemical changes in the air, which have some effect, probably small, on the
breakdown voltage. The changes in breakdown voltage due to changes in temperature and

SUBSIDIARY GAP .AS A MEANS FOR IMPROVING IGNITION.

pressure obey well-known laws, namely, the breakdown voltage is approximately proportional to the density and is only affected by temperature and pressure as they affect density.
The breakdown voltage of a series gap may be affected by the "hardness)) of the gap. A
gap is said to be hard when it has a higher breakdown voltage for rapidly varying potentials
than it has for slowly varying potentials. Hardness is of two kinds. If the elec trodes are
pointed, the gap is hard, due to its own form. For a rapidly varying potential, that is, one that
rises quickly to a maximum and then decreases to approximately zero in a very short time (in
other words, such a wave of potential as a magneto gives), the potential across a gap with pointed
electrodes frequentl.1 rises to as much as twice or three times the nOTmal breakdown voltage
without a spark passing. Obviously, then, pointed electrodes are not suitable for use either
for plug or series gaps.
For electrodes that are not pointed, that is, ones not having a radius of curvature small compared with their distance apart, hardness of the kind above described does not exist. Electrodes of this kind may be subject to a hardness due to some condition of the surface such that
the breakdown voltage for a rapidly varying potential is somewhat larger than that for a slowly
varying potential but rarely more than 1.,5 times as great. The condition of the surface which
produces such hardness is not well understood. It is known, however, that films of oil are capable of producing it. Consequently, in designing gaps, allowance has to be made for times
when the breakdown voltage is abnormally large.
The effects of previou.s discharges across a gap are to modify the hardness, as described in
the immediately preceding paragraph, and to cause a greater number of ions than normal to be
present in the gap . The hardness of the gap is as likely to be increased as it is to be decreased.
The presence of an abnormally large number of ions in the gap h as no effect upon the breakdown voltage of the gap but does cause the discharge to pass more promptly than it otherwise
would.
Change in dimensions due to temperature changes may occur in the series gap. The principal danger is not due to isotropic expansion but to warping owing to a strained condition of
the structure of the gap .
Series gaps have not been used extensively eno-qgh to permit the accumulation of any data
as to the importance in practice, relative or absolute, of the different effects named above.
The plug gap is affected by all the conditions that have just been enumerated. The
different circumstances in the engine cylinder, however, modify the relative importance of these
,
conditions.
The plug gap is subject to much more cOIT?sion than is the series gap on account of the
much higher temperatures prevailing in the engine cylinder, which are so high that surface
films are probably prevented from forming.
Variation in the proportions of the mixture probably has little effect on the breakdown
voltage. Variation in the compression has considerable effect, the breakdo'wn voltage being
proportional to the density of the charge at the moment of firing.
The presence of oil in the gap generally increases the breakdown voltage because the disch arge is obliged to follow a much longer path through the gas than if the oil were not present.
It is possible, if there is not much oil in the gap, that the breakdown voltage may be decreased
because it is well known that sparks will pass over consider ably greater distances along the
surface of insulators than they will dli'ectly through the gaps. It is generally thought, however , that this condition is seldom realized. The presence of carbon on the electrodes decreases
the breakdown voltage. Not infrequently the carbon forms a bridge from one electrode to the
other and effectually short cli'cuits the plug.
The higher temperatures prevailing in the engine cylinder render any change in the dimensions of the gap, due to temperature, more impoTtant than is the case in the series gap; but
with a proper design of plug, this effect is not to be feared.
In view of the high temperatures existing in the engine cylinder, it is thought that plug
gaps never exhibit the phenomenom of hardness . This opinion is particularly important for
the problem of the series gap because when the series gap breaks down the voltage on the plug
gap increases at a rate thousands or millions of times greater than the rate at which potential

188

ANNUAL RlllPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

is applied to the series gap. Any hardness found in the plug gap will probably cause much
greater variations in the breakdown voltage of the plug than will the same amount of hardness
in the breakdown voltage of the rie gap.
A f ,ther point of difference between the imple theory of Lhe action of the series gap and
actual conditions with a fouled plug is found in the fact that the re i tance of the fouling decrea es
as the E. ill. F. applied to it increase. The evidence on thi point has been ah'eady given. It
is easily seen that this characteri tic of the fouling requires a larger increase in the breakdown
voltage of the serie gap for a given increase in breakdown voltage of the park plug gap than
if the r sistance of the fouling were constant.
It was seen that an improvement in the action of the erie gap could be secured by putting
a condenser of suitable capacity in parallel with the source of E. M. F. 'll1is condenser should
have as small dielectric 10 es as po sible, as the maximwn E. M. F. of the magneto or coil i
decreased by an amount which depends directly upon the magnitude of the losses.
In discussions concerning the acLion of the series gap, iL is practically always assumed that
the passage of a discharge between the terminals of the plug will always fD·e the charge, and
consequently, that Lhe problem i solved when the plug can be made to po, s a park at the
proper Lime in every cycle of the engine. That this assumption i not always true, is shown by
the circum tance reported to this ~areau and mentioned aboye, that a certain engine would not
start with the series gap in circuit but would run with the gap in circuib after being started.
Some experiments at the BUTeau of SLandards made, it is true, with a smaller gap than i,,; usual
in plug (0.15 to 0.30 mm.) gave the following result: A gap was in erted in erie with
a clean plug in one of the cylinders of a foti.~-cylinder engine. When the length of the erie gap
wa zer the cylinder wovId mi ::; steadily. As the length of the erie gap increased the missing
became Ie ,and at a certain value of the gap Lhe engine fired perfectly. As the length of the
series gap was still further increa ed, the cylinder fired perfectly for a short range. A the gap
was increa ed still furLher, however, missing began again, and for a still further increase in length
the cylinder missed all the time. At all times during the experiment the serie gap would pass
a disch rge at the proper in tant of each cycle. \\hen the cylinder wa firing perfectly, obviou ly a discharge must have been pa ing between the electrode of the plug. When the length
of the series gap was increased and a discharge till kept pa . ing in it, the plug in the engine
cylinder must have given a spark for each di charge of the series gap. This fact shows that a
spark between the terminals of a plug does not nece arily fire the charge in the engine cylinder,
even though there i no change in the compo ition or clen iLy of the charge. It is not known
whether any phen mena imilar to those ju t described take place for park-plug gaps of the
dimen ions generally u ed (0.50 mm. ), but it will be well in any discu ion of the action of cries
gaps to bear in mind the possibility of their occurrence.
(C) THE DESIG

OF THE SERIES GAP.-FORM AND MATERIALS OF ELECTRODES.
GEKERAL DE WK.

The following requirements must be ati fied by a eries gap if it is to be of practical u e.
I ts breakdown voltage must be reasonably con tant and greater than that of the plug; it must
be able to spark the plug for the 10'.,-e I, value of fouling re istance likely to be met with in practice; and it mu t be reliable in action and of rea onably long life. In the following paragraphs
will be pointed out Lhe way in which the above requirements affect the de ign of the gap.
FORM A D MA TERrAL OF ELEOTRODES .

The fiT t question to be decided is that of the form and material of the electrodes, a these
are by far the most important factors in determining the breakdown voltage of the gap. In this
connection it has been suggested that a multiple gap could be used instead of a single gap.
There i at present practically no evidence that a multiple gap would ofrer any advantages over
single gap. As to the shape of the electrodes, it was seen above that pointed electrodes are
entirely unsuited for use either in the series gap or in the plug gap, and that in order to avoid
hardnes the radius of curvature of the electrodes hould not be small compared with the dis-

a

189

tance between electrodes. As long as this condition is satisfied the precise shape of the
electrodes seems to make no difference.
The requirements that the material of the electrodes should satisfy are as follows: The
breakdown voltage should be constant; the material should have good mechanical properties,
high thermal conductivity to . prevent heating, and should corrode but little in order that the
gap should have a long life. Nickel alloy wire of the sort used in spark plugs would seem to
satisfy these requirements best at the present time.
INSULATION OF GAP.

The insulating material supporting the electrodes of the serie gap should have, first and
foremo t, a very high insulation resistance. This is absolutely necessary because any leakagc3
between the electrodes of the gap i fatal to the gap's functioning. This material should be
able to stand heat without impairing its insulating properties, if the gap is integral with the
plug; and if the gap is tightly inclosed should be able to withstand corrosion by the nitric acid
which is formed from the air by the passage of the spark.
HOUSING OF THE GAP.

The series gap may be either in communication, more or less direct, with the atmosphere,
or may be tightly inclosed, even hermetically sealed. If the gap is open to the atmosphere, there
is little opportunity for corrosion by the discharge, and the consequent probable impairment
of the insulating properties of the housing. However, there is a certain fire risk if any considerable amount of gasoline vapor should be in the vicinity of the gap. Tests at the Bureau of
Standards have shown that this fire ri k may be eliminated by the use of a Davy gauze inclosing
the gap. A further point to be considered in connection with a gap open to the atmosphere,
when used on an aviation engine, is that at high altitudes the breakdown potential of the gap
is decreased. However, the den 'ity of the charge in the engine cylinder is correspondingly
decr1la ed, and the result i to preserve unchanged the ratio of the breakdown voltage of the
series gap to that of the plug gap. 1£ the gap is hermetically sealed, the products of discharge
can not escape, and there is a chance that the in ulation resi tance of the housing may be
decreased. Nothing is known at present about the amount of the products of discharge and
their effect upon the insulation reoistance of the hou ing. A tightly inclosed gap gives rise to
, no fire risk and has a constant breakdown voltage irrespective of altitude. A the breakdown
voltage of the plug in the engine cylinder decreases with increase in altitude, it is een that a
tightly inclosed gap offer great advantages in the matter of firing fouled plugs at high altitudes.
The adju tment of the length of a tightly inclosed gap, however, demands some attention.
The present state of our knowledge of the subject point to the necessity of the pilot being able
to adjust conveniently and at any time the length of the series gap. To satisfy this requirement in a tightly inclosed gap is not impos ible, but evidently complicates the de ign and
manufacture of the gap considerably.
LOCATION OF THE GAP.

The eries gap ha been placed in several locations: Integral with the plug; at the plug,
but not integral with it; and at the center of the distributor. The e various positions have
their advantages and disadvantages. If the gap is integral with the plug, it is in the be t position
electritally, because the capacity of the leads is directly in parallel with the magneto. However, if the gap is integral with the plug, it can not be adjusted while the engine is running
without the addition of an undesirable amount of mechanism. Al 0 the series gap in this place
will get hot, and its breakdown voltage will be subject to considerable variations . If the gap
i at the plug but not integral with it, it i still in the best place electri.:;ally, will not get so hot,
and will not be so subjed to variations in it- breakdown voltage . It can not be adjusted, however, while the engine is running without additional mechani m. If the gap is at the distributo!', it i not in such a good place electrically for firing a fouled plug. The capacity of the leads
to the plug is in this case directly in parallel with the plug and consequently has a detrimental

190

A

UAL REPORT NATIO AL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

effect on the ability of the series gap to fire the plug. There is only one case in which this position of the capacity may be advantageous. It was previously hown that for a clean plug it
is partially advantageous to have the capacity in parallel with the plug. A further advantage
of having the gap at the distributor is that its length can be adju ted easily while the engine
is running. As was seen from the data given above, a gap of fixed length does not seem to be
at all suited for the function of firing a fouled plug, and consequently, in order to be of any
considerable amount of use, the gap should be capable of adjustment while the engine i running .
It is po ible, however, that one adjustable gap at the center of the di tributor which serve
all the plug may not be a good arrangement, for some of the plug may he clean and some may
be fouled, the clean plugs requiring a difIerent length of gap for their efIective firing than the
fouled plugs. Thi sugge t the po sibility of having a gap in eries with the lead to each plug
and close to the di tributor. Thi would call for a separate adjustment of the length of each
gap. Whether the additional amount of apparatus thus required and the additional amount
of attention requu:ed from the pilot (in the ca e of an airplane engine) would be justified by
the results obtained is a matter for practical te t.
(D) DEGREE OF UTILITY TO BE EXPECTED OF SERIES GAPS.

As a result of the evidence given above, it may be concluded that the modification of jumpspark ignition y tems by the addition of a properly designed and operated gap in serie with
each plug may remedy effectively a considerable part of the trouble due to ca e of fouling met
in practice. At pre ent the limit of the method are not known; that i , one can not say definitely just what is the lowe t fouling resistance which can be handled by a erie gap on a given
ignition system and, conversely, :whether a given ignition system can or can not, by the u e of
a suitable eries gap, be made to park a plug with given fouling resi tance. The po ibilities
of the de ice, however, are well sho'wn by the fact, mentioned before in this report, that it wa
found possible in one ca e by using a series gap on an average ignition system (magneto) to
spark a plug having the extremely low value of fouling resistance of 4,000 ohm . The only
other positive conclusion that can be tated now i that th.e length of the series gap should be
capable of ea y adju tment by the operator of the engine at any given time.
In addition to work done in the laboratory and on a few engine, the installation of a large
number of gap in practice and a careful record of their performance i neces ary before the
question of the practical utility of the series gap can be con idered a entirely settled. Tl' l
practical test can be can-ied out at any time and independently of laboratory work, and I t
results would be of the greatest value.

The purpose of this report is to outline briefly the uccession of operations which occur in
high-tension ignition systems in order to show the connection between the various phenomena

apparatus. Figures 4 to 17, inclusive, give roproduction of osciUograms taken on magnetos
while operating under various conditions.
The cycle of operation of the jump-spark system can be split up into a number of periods.
During each perioel the electrical phenomena proceed under fairly definite conditions, each

INTRODUCTION.

The purpose of this report is to outline briefly the salient features of operation of the hightension magneto, and of the similar battery ignition systems, and to trace the various transformations of energy which take place. The results of numerous measurements on such systems
as have been studied at the Bureau of Standards will be quoted in illustration of these properties. Th se phenomena are doubtless understood by magneto designers, but with the exception
of the excellent papers by Armagnat and Young referred to below, the literature of the subject
is very meager and consi ts chiefly in elementary expositions for the instruction of the amateur
automobilist.
The cycle of operation of a jump-spark system can be divided into a number of period .
During each period the electrical phenomena proceed under fairly definite and constant conditions, each period being separated from tbe one preceding and the one following it by an
abrupt cbange of conditions. It is hoped in later reports to discuss in greater detail and in a
more quantitative manner the phenomena of certain of the periods; and the present report is
issued as a basis for interrelating these later discussions.
The operation of the usual forms of ba't tery ignition systems is quite similar in many respects
to that of the magneto , and the greater part of the following discussion is applicable to both,
with suitable changes in the values of the various constants. The principal points of difference
in the two types of apparatus are discussed later under" Battery Systems."
Throughout this report frequent reference will be made to numerical values of the various
quantities which may be expected in a typical case. For this purpose a magneto having the
constants in the following Table I has been chosen. These constants do not precisely fit any
individual magneto but are representative 0 f values measured on a number of different types
recently tested.

OUTLINE OF OPERATION.

The high tension magneto combines in a single machine the functions of an electric generator
and of an induction coil, and these two functions are to a considerable extent independent of
one another.
The ci-Tcuits of a high-ten ion magneto are sub tantially as shown in figure 1, P being the
primary winding whicb has a few turns of coarse wire and consequently a low resi tance, while
the secondary winding S has several thousand turns of fine wire. The two coils are wound one
over the other on a common iron core, which (in the ordinary or shuttle type) bas the form
shown in figure 3. Condenser 0 1 is connected acro s the terminals of P primarily to reduce
the sparking at the contact breaker B. The electrostatic capacity between the econdary
winding or high tension leads and the grounded frame of the machine is u:fIiciently large to
have a material effect on the operation. This capacity is in part distributed along the windings
and various portions are consequently subject to different voltages. The effect of tbis capacity
may, however, be approximately represented by an equivalent condenser connected as shown
dotted in O2 , figure 1.

CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH -TENSION MAGNETOS.

The rotation of the armature in the field of the permanent magnets N S, figure 3, generates
a current in P which flows through contacts B. When a spark i desired, breaker B is suddenly
opened by a cam.

The current decreases rapidly, producing a high voltage M

~;

in the

secondary. This is led through a di tributor (not shown) to the spark gap G in the proper
cylinder of the engine. This gap breaks down at u ually much Ie s than the maximum available voltage and the magnetic energy originally tored in the primary is transfelTed to the
secondary and dissipated in the gap.
Magneto may be c1assified as "two-spark," "four-spark," etc., according to the number
of sparks produced per revolution of the rotor. The shuttle core type gives two sparks while
most inductor type machines give fOUT. As a rule all the alternations arc ub tantially alike
except for the polarity of the induced voltage, though lack of symmetry in a four-spark machine
may cause slight differences. Special magnetos designed to pre V-type motors such as the
"Liberty 12," where the angle. between the blocks is not a simple submultiple of the angle
between the cranks, may have successive alternations of materially different wave form. (See
figure 4, which shows the primary and secondary currents of such a magneto. ) The discussion
below, however, will apply to anyone alternation in any case.
DETAILS OF OPERATING PERIODS.

The time occupied by one alternation of the magneto may be subdivided into six periods
during each of which the circuit conditions are substantially constant, but between which
there is a more or less abrupt change in these conditions. These period are listed in the
following table and discussed in more detail below. (See figure 12.)

PERIOD 1.

During Period 1, the breaker is closed and the armature rotates from the position of
maximum flux to the firing position where the cam causes the breaker to open. This period
corresponds to about 100 0 rotation in our typical example and hence lasts 0.008 seconds.
During this time the reduction in flux builds up a cUlTent (in our example 4 amperes) which
tends to maintain the original fhu after the rotor ha pa sed the neutral position.
If there were absolutely no resistance in the primary winding or breaker contacts the
current would build up to such a value that the aTmature flux would be maintained constant
when rotated to a po ition at right angles to or even oppo ing the magnetomotive force of the
permanent magnets. This maintenance of the flux is shown quite clearly in figure 20, which
shows the total flux through the armature core plotted against angular position (or time) for
three different conditions. Here curve I shows the flux through the core on open circuit and
is due to the permanent magnets only; curves II and III give the total flux during normal
operation of the magneto at low and high speed respectively, and curve IV shows the flux if
the primary is left short circuited throughout a complete cycle. The action of the primary
circuit in thus closing about the flux produced by the permanent magnets and permitting it •
to be moved unaltered to a new position is in a sense analogous to the action of an electrophorous in ,,'hich the charge produced by induction from the exciting charge on the dielectric
slab is insulated and moved out of the field of the permanent charge. In either case, the
energy is obtained from the motion of the system and the permanent magnets or fixed charge
suffer no depletion. The closing of the breaker cOlTesponds to the opening of the ground
connection to the electrophorous plate at the beginning of its motion, and the opening of the
breaker corresponds to the discharge of the plate after its removal from the slab.

CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH -TENSION MAGNETOS.

199

In the actual magneto the primary resistance materially reduces the generated current
and the actual flQ.'{ at break is (as shO\rn in plot 20) considerably less than the maximum
open circuit flux.
It should be noted that there is a very considerable difference in the operation of a magneto
at low and at high speeds. In the former case, the primary current is limited chiefly by the
re istance of the windings and has approximately the same wave form as the generated voltage.
The maximum current reached is proportional to the speed and is small so that the total energy
stored magnetically is also small. Consequently at "break" nearly all of this energy must be
transferred to the electrostatic capacity of the windings and condenser before the voltage is
sufficiently high to jump a normal spark plug gap. At high speeds on the other hand the
current is limited by the inductance of the circuit and is nearly independent of speed. The
current and magnetic energy are very much greater and only a negligible part of this energy
is expended at "break" in charging the capacities to the breakdown voltage. This effect is
shown in plot 21 in which the current generated in the short-circuited primary at various
speeds is plotted against speed. The lower curve shows the effective (root-mean-square) value
as observed with a hot wire ammeter, and the upper curve the maximum value of the current
wave from oscillograms. It is evident that above 400 revolutions per minute the current is
large and independent of the speed while at low pecds the current is smaller and of more peaked
wave form. This is also shown by a comparison of figures 5 and 6 which show the difference
in the wave form of the primary current on short circuit at low and high speeds.
The primary current finally attained at break, IB, is of the greatest importance in determining the performance of the apparatus. It can be determined directly by an oscillograph by
inserting a shunt of about 0.025 ohm in sel'ies with the primary and connecting the oscillograph
vibrator across this shunt. This method has the disadvantage ot introducing resistance into
the circuit and thereby disturbing conditions. At high speeds this disturbance is entirely
negligible, for the current \s then limited b..v the inductance rather than the resistance of the
circuit. At low speeds, however, the resistance predominates and the error might amount to
5 per cent or 10 per cent at very low speeds. The current waves in figures 4 to 19 were obtained
in this manner.
Other methods for determining the primary current wave are based on first obtaining the
open-circuit voltage wave or the flux wave and then computing the current by a step-by-step
process.
Armagnat 1 and Young 2 have developed the following equations for this purpose from the
fundamental equation

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Since e in the above equation is the E. M. F. generated by the flux from the permane t
magnets only, we may write

(5)
and
(6)

and hence may compute i from the open-circuit flux ·w ave by equation (4).
The voltage wave (figmes 8, 9, and 10) may be observed directly with the oscillograph y
connectino the vibrator in eries with a resistance of several hundred ohms across the breaker
point (the latter being permanently insulated). This connection does not appr ciably interfere
with the conditions of operation. An alternative method is io observe the primary flux wave
with the allistic galVanometer and obtain the voltage ·w ave from this by the equation

E=PERIOD 2.

Period 2 is of extremely hort duration (about 0.00002 second) and extends from t he
instant of opening of the breaker io the time of breakdown of the spark gap.
DW'iug this period both the breaker and park gap are open, and the sy tem consists of
two inductance coils very closely couplcd magnetically and each sh.u nted by capacity. Si ce
it is imp sible without the expenditme of infinite power to abruptly change the current in an
inuuctive circuit, the primary cunent now flows into the condenser rapidly charging it. The
charge in the conden er offers a continually increasing electromotive force in opposition to the
primary cmrent, which therefore decreases at a con tantly increasing rate. Tpe decrease of
flux re ulting from this decrease of primary CUlTen t generates an E. M. F. in the secondary winding
which in tmn sends a charging cmrent into the distributed capacity of the secondary winding
and leads. The net effect is, therefore, a partial transfer of cmrent from the primary to the
secondary windings. If the spark gap were not present this process would continue until the
magnetic energy had been entirely converted into electrostatic energy in the charge capacitie ,
at which time the cmI'ents would have been brought to zero and the flux would have the value
determined by the permanent magnet alone. The maXImum voltage which would be reac ed
at this time, if energy los es are ileglccted, is given approximately by the equation.

a

where L is ihe inductance of the primary winding and the capacity which i equivalent to t he
combined effect of both the primary cOI)denser and secondary distributed capacity. For our
typical e ' ample this would reach 70,000 volts.
ctually there is throughout this time a stea.dy
drain of energy due to the're i tance of the winding, the dielectric loss in the condenser, and
e pecially the eddy CUlTents in the iron cor e and pole piece . These losses are sufficient to
reduce the maximum voltage to about 40,000 volts.
The CUI'V'es in plot 22 show the rise of voltage and decrea e of fllL,{ a computed for ou r
typical examp!e after making certain simplifying a sumptions.
If account is taken of the magnetic leakage flux between the two coils, the voltage w l ~ve
will be found to be a combination of that sho\vn with a second oscillation of higher frequeucy
and smaller amplitude. The theory of thi effect has been worked out by Prof. E. ' Taylor
Jones (Phil. Mag. , August, 191 ).
The curves marked " open circuit " are computed for the case when there is no energy loss
except that in the resistance of the windings. The second pair of curves compu teci for a shunt
of 560,000 ohms connected aero s the high tension terminals correspond to a drain of ene gy

approximately equal to that to be expected from eddy currents. The third pair of curves
correspond to a shunting resistance of 110,000 ohms, which might occur with a partially fouled
spark plug. The assumption upon which all these curves have been constructed is that the spark
gap does not break down. In normal operation, however, the spark gap breaks down at about
6,000 volts, and consequently new circuit conditions are introduced before the resultant flux
has decreased materially from its value at .break.
In the above discussion it is assumed th!1t the breaker succeeds in opening the circuit
without sparking at the contacts. If an arc occurs at break, some of the energy is di sipated
then, and the rate of decrease of pr.imary current, and consequently the induced secondary
voltage, is much Ie s. Figures 14 and 15 show the excessive arcing at the breaker which occurred
when a special cam was used giving a very slow rate of separation of the breaker point. The
contacts separate at a, but the arc maintains the current until b, when it finally breaks and a
considerably reduced park results.
PERIOD 3.

When the gap has broken down it affords a conducting path, and the charged secondary
capacity and leads immediately discharge through it. The exact conditions existing in the
spark, particularly immediately after break down, are still ou..;cure, and it is possible that this
first discharge may be oscillatory and of high frequency.
•
Tests made by loosely coupling a sensitive wave meter to the secondary circuit of a magneto have shown no indication of resonance with any oscill!1tions within the range between 30,000
and 1,000,000 cycles, although the apparatus u ed was sufficiently sensitive to have detected il
steady oscillation of 0.2 milliampere throughou t the range. A circuit formecl by connecting a
loop from one point of the distributor to ground was found to abso'l.'b oscillations of frequencies
from 3,000,000 to 10,000,000 cycles per second for various configurations of the loop, but no
such ab orption was detected at frequencies from 2,000 to 30,000 cycles per second. Any
oscillations which may have been pre ent must therefore have been very feeble or very highly
damped .
In addition to this discharge of the lead , the current increases rapidly in the seconqary,
since it is now practically short-circuited by the gap; and the primary current simultaneously
decreases at such a rate that the total ampere turns linking the main flux are maintained with
little loss. The charged primary condenser hastens the decrease of primary current and ultimately re\yerses it for a short time while the condenser energy is being shifted to the secondary
side. The di sipation of energy ill the gap, however, is probably sufIicient to damp out any
oscillations from this condenser.
'
,
The net results of the three simultaneous proces e during thi period are, therefore, (a ) the
discharge into the gap of the energy stored in the capacity of the leads; (b) the complete stopping of the primary current and the formation of a secondary current giving approximately
the same ampere turns; and (c) the dissipation in the windings and gap of the energy in the
primary condenser. The duration of . the period is of the order of one cycle of an oscillation.
determined by the primary condenser and the leakagc inductance of the windings (approximately 0.00005 second ). The energy discharged into the gil,p during this time is about 0.002
joules, which recent measurements indicate is just about sufficicnt to ignite an explosiye mixture. It is therefore probable that this period 3 is the one fundamental to ignition.
PERIOD 4.

Period 4 extends from the establishment of the secondary current in a steady arc acro the
park gap to the extinction of the spark. During this time there exists across the gap a steady
discharge which lasts for a considerablc time (0.003 econd in the case 'of a 5-mm. spark gap ill
air). It has been found experimentally that the voltage drop in the gap is roughly constant
during this entire period, a is shown by 0 cillogram uch as figuro 16. The capacities therefore
remain with a small charge and have little effect on the phenomena. The energy dissipated ill
the gap is supplied. by the decay of the ocondary current in the coil, and since the voltage is
approximately constant and

The instantaneous resistance of the sparl(

high value at the end. It is during thi period that the major part of the energy of the sparl<

rotation of the secondary winding in the magnetic field is comparable with the sustaining voltage

In the case of iron-olad circuits such as are here considered the term "inductance" is
somewhat ague and is difficult to define preci ely. It evidently varies with the angtJ..lar position of the rotor, with the current flowing, and (because of eddy currents) with the rate of change
of current. It is possible, however, with the armature clamped in any given position, to 'd etermine by the ballistic gal vanometer the change in flux turns corresponding to any given change
in current, and the equivalent inductance can then be computed. Plot 23 shows hys 're is
loops determined in this way. This illustrates the relation between the ccondary flux turns
and the primary current for a shuttle-type magneto when the armature is clamped in the po itions f zero flux and maximum flux, respecti\'ely. In the first positio'n', the permanent maO'nets s nd no flux through the armature core, and the loop was obtained in the usual manner
with currents in both directions. In the second position the magnet alone would produce
the fl x indicated by the apex of the loop . The curve was obtained by aPI1lying currents
opp(') ing the magnets a9-d noting the corresponding changes in flux. From curves of thi kind
i t is p ssible to establi h approximately the equivalent inductance corresponding to any given'
(;onditions.
A much simpler method is to mea ure the effective inductance of the' windings while
clamped in any position with alternating current, using either a bridge or a ·voltmcter-am eter~
wattmeter method. A typical curve obtained in this way is shown in plot 24. This method
was used in obtaining the values given in the preceding table.

CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH-TENSION MAGNETOS.

205

The stopping of the steady arc and consequen tly the end of period 4 may be due to one or
the other of two causes. Those are (a) the exhaustion of the energy supply which results' in
the gradual reduction of the current to zero al?-d the cessation of the arc, as is shown i:h figur~s
11 and 14, or (b) the closing of the primary breaker which has the effect of quickly extinguishing
the spark, as is shown at a in figure 13. In the former case there is at very small currents a
rather rapid increase of the sustaining voltage (as at a, figure 16) to a value which at the instant
of cessation of the spark may be double its normal value. The secondary current consequently
drops to zero at a somewhat more rapid rate than during the major portion of period 4. The
"natural" or uninterrupted dying out of the spark usually occurs in magnetos operating at
moderate speeds and .with rea onably long spark gap , and almost invariably occurs in battery
systems. It may be considered as the normal mode of operation of the system.
Owing to the large num bel' of variables (such as current at break, rotational energy, and
extinction of the spark by the closing breaker) which affect the total heat liberated in the gap, it
is impracticable to accurately predetermine the heat per spark for any particular condition.
Plot 25 shows hQ\\ this heat (observed calorimetrically) varies with magneto speed for a
particular German Bosch 7II6 magneto:
PERIOD 5.

If the magneto is operating at very high speed or all a very short spark gap, the primary

contact breaker may close before the spark has died ou t. In this case the circuit conditions
are again · changed and an additional transition period 5 must be con idered. The sequence
of events during this period is quite closely the inverse of that occurring during period 3. The
decreasing flux caused by the decreasing secondary current induce an E. M. F. in the primary
turns which rapidly builds up current in the now short-circuited primary winding. This
increase of current in turn, by its mutua'! induction on the secondary turns, rapidly decreases
the secondary current. The net effect is that the remaining ampere turns linking the main
. flux are tran felTed from the secondary back to the primary and the park is extinguished. At
the same time the primary condenser which had been charged to the small voltage given by
the quotient of E s divided by the ratio of turns, cUscharges through Lhe contact, and later the
secondary capacity is similarly cUscharged. The entire duration of the period is extremely
short and is of the order of 0.00005 second.
PERIOD 6.

Period 6 may be defined as la ting from the end of period 5 until the armature has rotated
to Lho position where it receives maximum :flux from the magnets. During this time the primary
current continues to decay approximately according to the exponential law
R

- - I
L

J = Joe

where Rand L are the re istance and inductance of the primary circuit and 10 is the current
at the end of period 5.

The value of

~

for this circuit is much smaller than for the circuit

formed of the se00ndary winding and spark, so that the rate of decrease of current is quite
slow, and an apPl'e'ciable current may be flowing, when the position of maximum flux is reached,
and period 1 of the next alternation begin.
In some ca es this interference may be so great as to cau e the succeeding spark to miss
fire as shown in figure 17. In cases where the spark dies out before the closing of the breaker,
period 6 .follows immediately after period 4 and the circuit is practically free from current
~hroughout the period.
During the interval after the dying out of the spark and before the closing of the breaker
there m~y remain a small amount of local eddy currents in the iron core and pole pieces. As
these' decay exponentially they induce iIi the winding an appreciable E. M. F. such as is shown
at b in figure 16. After the closing of the 'breaker, thi E. M. F. reestablishes a small primary
current in the original direction, as shown at a in figure 12. These minor effects afford possible
but' rather inaccurate means of estimating the magnitude of the eddy currents and hence their
much more serious effect during period 2.

BATTERY SYSTEMS.

In the ca e of the usual arrangement of battery system, the typical connections of which
are shown in figure 2, period 1 may be defined as lasting from the closing of the primttry cont act
to its opening, and is quite clo ely analogous to period 1 for a magneto. The primary current
builds up durinO" this period approximately according to the equation
l=

~(l-e -~t)

but may depart· somewhat from this becau e of the varying permeability of the iron core and
the heating and consequent change in resi tance of part of the circuit. This rise of cune t is
shown in figures 1 and 19. In the o-called "closed circuit" type of ystem, period 1 last
during a constant angular motion of the engine shaft and its duration is con equently short~r
the higher the speed. In the "open circuit" system the circuit is closed for a ~onstant time
interval at all speeds and this interval is u ually much Ie s than required for the current to
E
approach the constant value 1(
The energy which cq,n pe stored in the magnetic field during this' period is usually decidecU.f
less than that obtained with a magneto at normal speed because of the lower voltage avail able.
The battery system usually operates on 6 or 12 volts, while a magneto may give a primary
peak voltage from 50 to 100 volts at high speed. The battery, however, maintains its voltage
at all speeds whilo the magneto may give only 4 or 5 volts peak at 100 revolutions per minutd.
Periods 2,3, and 4 are practically the ame in hoth ,battery and magneto systems ex ept
that the effect of the rotational energy is absent in the battery ystem, and the spark heat for
the same induetive energy i correspondingly reduced. Owing to thi small energy oontent,
the spark almost invariably dies out before the closing9f the contact fot the next spark, as
shown in figures 1 and 19. Consequently, period 5 is absent and the circuit is entirely dead
during period 6.
CONCLUSIONS.

It appears from the above analysis that periods 1, 4, and 6 are of comparatively long
duration and the phenomena occurring therein n.re relatively low and well understood. Periods
2 and 3, on the other hand, are extremely short, and very little experimental data are available
to confirm or di prove the theoretical peculation as to what take place. These two periods
are, ho ever, in a sense the most important of the entire cycle ince it is the rise of voltage ill
period 2 which determines whether or not a park passes at all, and the actual ignition of the
mixture probabl! occurs during -period 3. The usual form of 0 cillo graph a.re entirely una.ble

to analyze processes of such short duration, but the Braun tube (or cathode ray oscillograph)
seems to afford a promising tool for studying these phenomena.
It seems evident that the distributed cap acity of the secondary winding and high tension
leads is of great moment in det ermining tho max imum voltage attained in period 2. Also the
eddy currents cause 8: very serious drain of energy, particularly in magnetos with solid pole
pieces, though their effect is probably qui te small in battery systems in which the magnetic
circuit can b e thoroughly lamin ated . Convenient methods of measuring the e two effects are
greatly needed. Preliminary measurements of the apparent resistance and inductance of the
windings with an alternating current bridge at froquencie up to 3,000 cycle thro~ some light
on this problem, and if a convenien t way of interpreting the results can be worked out, this
method may prove useful.
The r equirements of an ignition system are quite different from almost any other form of
electric generating system and are in some re pects conIlicting in character. A high voltage is
required to jump the spark gap through the compres ed gas in the engine cylinder. While
this is usually only 5,000 t o 6,000 volts, it may be very materially increased by oil :films on the
electrodes and a cold ,and consequen tly dense charge when starting an engine.
uch a high
voltage, of course, r equire a large number of secondary turns. On the other hand, the spark
plugs frequently become coat ed with a conducting film of carbon, which drains the energy
during period 2 in much the same manner a the eddy current. It then becomes necessary to
supply such a large current that the IR drop in the carbon deposit is equal to the sparking
voltage of the gap in ord er to produce a spa rk. Since the secondary current during periods
3 and 4 is -limited to the value which produces the ame ampere turns around the armature
core as did the primary current befor e " break," thi econd condition requires a small number of
secondary turns.
R ecent measurements at the British J ational P hysical Laboratory indicate that the actual
energy r equired for igni tion is very small compared to that furni hed by any commercial form
of ignition system , and any excessive amount of power is slightly detrimental in that it increases
burning of the spark plug and con tact breake r terminals. The paradoxical requirement is
ther efore for a system furnishing large current and voltage but small power.
A possible solution to this problem lies in the u e of a suitable subsidiary 8park gap and
condenser a;s used in the L odge arrangement and similar high frequency systems, in which
the voltage is made as great as possible and the large current required by a fouled plug i
obtained by the sudden discharge of a condenser through the auxiliary gap. The presence of
the condenser, however, tends to reduce the maximum voltage attainable and to some extent
defeats its own purpose. R eport No. 57 gives the results of preliminary work on this type of
device.

and the junction of the primary and secondary windings. The rcsistances arc then adjusted
until no kick of the galvanometer occurs whell the mao-netic flux through Lhe coils is uddenly
varied. TIli YarialiOIl in flux may be made by moving the roLor of the magneto 01' by interrupting a curront in either winding. From mea 'urements by both method an ·timate of the
magneti't leakage and coupling coefficient is obtained. HesuIt · obtained on various magnetos
by this method are given. The ratio arc usuall:r between 40:1 and 70:l, and the magnetic
leakage flux is only 2 to 4 pel' cent of the flux common to both windings.
INTR(jDUCTION.

, . A knowledo-e of the ratio of turn or more trictly the ratio of magnetic linkages between
the primary and econcIary windings of magnetos or spark coils i frequently needed, both in
predicting lhe performance to be expected from a given coil and in analyzing the results of

novelty in respect to it. It ha , however, been found very useful in connection with the investigation of ignition problems and is capable of all the accuracy needed in such work.
PROCEDURE.

For irn"ply obtaining an approximate value for the ratio of turns the connections shown

In case only moderate accuracy j needed, any low range direct current milliammeter or milli·

A imilar arrangement can, of COUl' e, be used to end current through the secondfLry
windings, as is hown in figure I e.
ince the value of the resistances Sand P are involved in
the final formula, these bridge circuits serve very conveniently, if the values of Rs and R4 are
known, to mea ure the re istances of the windings.
Owing to the fact that the windings arc of copper, which rises in temperature con idera ly
when carrying the workinO' current, it is u uoJly convenient to in ert a manganin resi tance of
about 0 e ohm in serie' with the primary winding. This serves to reduce the temperature
coefficient of the circuit and greatly reduces the drift of the galvanometer due to the heating.
In the imple arrangement ho\\,n in figure 1" the presence of' a condenser shunted arotmd
the primary ha no eITect upon the mell urements ince it i uncharged both at the beginning
and end of the operation. 'When sending current through the windings from a battery, however,
the conden er is charged initially to a voltage equal to the IR drop in the winding, and t.his
energy adds to the ballistic throw when the circuit is broken. In actual practice, howe 'er,
this effect i entirely negligible . Figure 2 shows the circuits a actually u ed at the Bur au
of Standards in which the double throw switches marked S-P serve to connect the. auxiliary
bridge arms for use in sending current through the secondary or primary coil, respectively,
and the simple arrangement in figure la is obtained when all the switche are opened. The
values of resi tan es used are gi,en in the following taLle:

RI = dial box, 1000's to 10's .

DISCUSSION OF MAGNETIC CIRCUIT .

It will be ob el'Yed that this method gi\'es, strictly speaking, the ratio of flux turns III the
two coil' and not the ratio of turn themselves and a consideration of the magnetic circuit, as
indicated in figure 3, shows the values of thi ratio to be expected in the various case. For
the circuits hown in figure la, in which only the field of the permanent magnet i used, it is
evident from figure 3a that ome of the flux will pass through the econdary coil without linking
thu observed will therefore be greater than N $ · If the mea ure1Vp

of the shuttle core type which shows these variations in apparent ratio is given in Table J.

t.he operation of the ~agneto is very complex, but the energy involved in the leakage flux is
obviously' small compared with the total amount of energy stored.

REPORT NO. 59.
GENERAL ANALYSIS OF AIRPLANE RADIATOR PROBLEMS.
By H. C.

DICKINSON,

W. S.

JAMES

and R. V.

KLEI SCHMIDT.

The objects of this report are (1) to present the analysis of the problem on which the experimental work conducted at the Bureau of Standards is based, (2) to explain the technical terms
used in the work, and (3) to show the relations between the various parts of the work which
are dealt with in detail in other reports.
The function of a radiator is to dissipate heat, but while doing so, it will have certain
adverse effects on the plane on which it is mounted. First, it will add to the weight; second,
the conditions for obtaining the best transfer of heat from the metal surface to the air require
that the air shall flow rapidly past the surface, and this condition cause head resistance;
third, certain positions of mounting on the plane seriou ly obstruct the new of the pilot or
observer. A fourth factor of special importance in military airplanes is vulnerability and
liability to injury, either from accident or from enemy bullets. The last two factors, not
being capable of measurement, have not been considered in this investigation.
STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM.

The problem of design therefore becomes one of determining the 'type of structure, and
the location on the plane, that shall give the radiator the cooling capacity required for .the
engine with which it is to be used, and at the same time shall result in a minimum adverse
effect on the plane. The adverse effects due to weight and head resistance will be represented
by the power absorbed in lifting and sustaining the weight and in overcoming the head resistance, and the fundamental criterion for an airplane radiator will be that its absorption of
power shall be low, when it is of such size as to dissipate the required amount of heat.
It is necessary to state with some care what is meant by "power absorbed chargeable to
the radiator." If it were possible to build and operate a plane without any radiator (or other
construction to perform its function), a certain amount of power would be required to drive
the plane through the air at a given speed. But the addition of the radiator may necessitate
alterations in structure (such as the substitution of a flat-nose radiator for a stream-line nose
or the enlargement of the fuselage in order to accommodate the radiator required), which will
make the resistance of the plane greater than in the former case; and the radiator itself will
add 'to the weight of the plane and will 'Offer resistance to passage through the air. The difference between the power required to drive the plane as equipped with the radiator and that
required to drive it at the same speed when designed without a radiator is the power absorbed
chargeable to the radiator. It includes power absorbed due to (1) weight of the radiator;.
(2) pressure difference producing flow of air through the radiator (i. e., the' head resistance of
the core); (3) any increase in the resistance of the fuselage or other parts of the plane caused
by changes in the condition of air flow around the parts, or by changes in the structure necessitated by the radiator; (4) pressure necessary to produce water flow through the radiator.
Items (2) and (3) together constitute the head resistanee chargeable to the radiator, as dist.inguished from the head resistance of the core. In the case of a nose radiator there is not only a
change in the condition of air flow due to the air which passes into the fuselage and out through
the l ouvres, but also a change in form of the fuselage, due to the flat (and sometimes enlarged)
nose required to accommodate the radiator.

THREE METHODS OF ATTACK.

There are three ways in which the problem may be attacked, namely :
1. A study of complete radiators on planes.
2. A study of types of radiator core and the methods of generalizing results to obtain the
properties of complete radiators.
3. A study of the properties of single tubes, cells, or plates.
. The first of these has been the ba is of cut-and-try methods of determining whether a
r adiator will cool or not, but it has not been possible to consider the adverse effect on the plane
by this method, except roughly. Weight is the only factor that can easily be measured, fLnd
it is found that in determining the power absorbed, weight may be of but mall importance in
.compari on with head resistance. Although it might be possible to work out a method whereby
complete data could be obtained from tests in flight, the expense and difficulty of making the
necessary large number of tests on planes is so great that a simpler method has been chosen,
which will allow a large number of types of core to be tested under widely varying conditions
of use.
The study of types of core has therefore been selected as the basis of the experimental
work, to be supplemented by such work on complete radiators in planes as may be required to
verify the conclusions reached, and furnish needed data on the effect of location on performance.
It has also been found advisable further to simplify certain portions of the work by studie~ on
single tubes and plates.
The object of a laboratory study of types of core is to determine:
1. The structural characteristics of the core which determine its performance in any part icular case, and the efi'ect of these characteristics on performance.
2. The properties, or behavior, of the core when subjected to various conditions of use.
3. The conditions under which the core will operatA when it is a portion of a radiator in
any particular location on a plane.
STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A CORE.

The characteristics of a core which' determine its behavior under given conditions of use
have been taken to be:
1. Form and dimensions of air and water passages.
2. Depth of the core (measured in the direction of the air flow).
3. Kind and thickness of metal.
4. The portion of the frontal area which is open to allow the passage of air through the
core, called" free area of the air tubes."
5. Extent and nature of cooling surface.
As an example of the way in which these factors influen e the performance 01 the core, the
following may be noted. As the depth of a core is increased the efi'ectiveness of the co ling
surface decreases owing to the rise in the temperature of the air as it passes through tho air
tubes, and the consequent decrease in temperature difference between the surface and the air.
At the same time the amount of air that will flow through a tube decreases as the depth increases,
tending further to reduce the cooling per unit surface. On the other hand, the total amount of
cooling surface per unit of frontal area is increased, and at a much smaller cost in head resist:1nce
than would be · the case if the frontal area were increased . Many of the eiIects of struct.ural
characteristics are governed by well-established laws so that a mathematical theory can be
developed to predict their magnitude.
PROPERTIES EXPRESSING THE BEHAVIOR OF A CORE.

The properties of a core which express its performance are the following:
1. Energy dissipated (heat transfer or cooling capacity) .-Since heat may be expressed in
units of work, the rate of dissipation of heat may be exuressed in units of power. It has been
expressed in horsepower per square foot of frontal area, at any given air speed, for the con-

•

219

ditions of turbulent water flow and a temperature difference of 100° F. between the water and
air, as defined below.
.
2. Weight of the core, and of the water contained, are important properties, being directly
involved in the computation of horsepower absorbed.
3. Head resistance of the core, the force required to push it through the air, must be distinguished from head resistance chargeable to the radiator (defined above), which is the part of
the over-all resistance of the plane caused by the radiator and any modifications of structure
that the radiator may make necessary.
4. Mass flow constant.-It is found for all ordinary types of core that, when supported in a
fr~e air stream, the amount of air that passes through the core is proportional to the free air
speed (at constant density), and therefore is proportional to the mass of air that would pass
through the area occupied by the core if the core were removed. The fractional part of the air
approaching the core, which actually passes through its air tubes, has been ca·lled the mass flow
constant of the core. It is an important property, since the heat transfer and the head resistance
are both closely related to it.
5. The power absorbed by a core may be computed from the head resistance and the weight
as follows:
(a) If the total weight and the total available power (at the propeller) are known for the
plane, the power absorbed by the weight of the core can be found approximately, and to this
must be added the power required to overcome the head resistance, the latter being obtained
directly from the head resistance and the speed of the plane.
(b) If the lift-drift ratio of the plane is lmown, it is simpler to divide the weight by this
ratio, and thus reduce it to equivalent head resistance; i. e., drag on the wings and structure
required to carry the weight, and to add this to the head resistance before multiplying by the
plane speed to obtain the power absorbed.
In either case, it should be borne in mind that the power so computed is not necessarily
equal to the power chargeable to the radiator, but is subject to the same limitations as the head
resistance, as noted above. This method, which is intended to give a basis for comparison
between cores, gives only an approximation. The British have shown by a very careful analysis
the effect on a plane of small additions of weight and resistance, and it is shown that their
relative importance varies greatly, according as top speed or rate of climb is given greater
weight. This, of course, is due to the change in lift..cIrift ratio under various conditions.
6. Figure of merit.-In order to obtain a quantity by means of which the performance of
v:arious cores can easily be compared, it is necessary to consider both the energy dissipated.
and the power absorbed. The rate at which a radiator dissipates heat per unit power absorbed
is a measure of the suitability of the radiator for airplane use so far as these two factors are
concerned. This quantity has been called the figure of merit. The figure of merit will be the
criterion for a radiator in any position, provided the power absorbed is the total power absorbed
nfortunately it is necessary to limit the definichargeable to the radiator as defined above.
tions of head resi tance of a core and power ab orbed by a core to very pecific conditions of
use which can be accurately reproduced in the laboratory, so that it is only when the air flow
around the radiator is not obstructed by other parts of the plane that the figure of merit of a
core is of value in determining the figure of merit of a mdiator.
CONDITIONS OF USE.

The conditions of use which affect the performance of the radiator, have been chosen not
only to give the most accurate de cription of the factors which really determine the properties,
but also to allow of easy comparison with the conditions found in flight. They are the following:
1. The mass flow of air through the core. This is defined as the mass of air that flows
per second through the air tubes of a section of core of one square foot frontal area. This use
of the term "mass flow" is identical with the common use of the term in the works of Osborne
Reynolds and others, if the radiator is regarded as a structure through which air flows, and no
account is taken of the fact that the flow is made up of a flow through a number of small tubes.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

A careful di tinction is made between the velocity of the air approaching the racliator
(free air speed) and the mass flow through the core. It i the latter quantity that determines
the effect of air velocity on heat tran fer. It should be noted that the flow of air through the
core depends upon many factors be ides the free air speed.
2. Temperature difference between air and water. Strictly speaking, the heat transfer
i determined by the mean over the entire ore, of the temperature difference between the air
and the water, at each small element of cooling urface. It can be hown, however, that for a
given radiator under constant conditions of air flow and water flow, except that the au. and
water temperature vary, the heat transfer is very nearly proportional to the difference between the mean temperature of the water and the temperature of the entering air.. The
water temperature depend , however, on the total length of the core, as well as upon the rate
of flow through the core, 0 that it i much simpler to use the mean water temperature.
The logarithmic mean should theoretically be u ed, but a the arithmetic mean differs from
it very slightly under ordinary condition of use it has been employed to save labor. The
temperature difference under which a core works i given, then, a the difference between
the temperature of the entering air and the mean of the temperatures of the enterir:.g and
leaving water .
. Air density. - Re ult have neen reduced to a "standard" air density of 0.0750 pounds
per cubic foot (0.001201 grams per cCi approximately density of dry air at 20 0 C., 7 0 F.).
4. Flow of water may be expre ed in two way , in quantity unit, and in linear velocity
through the tube. The quantity of water flowing aiIects the drop in temperature of the water
in p ' sing through the radiator, while the linear velocity determines to some extent the rate of
heat tran fer.
5. The mechanical condition of the air and water in the tubes of the core is of considerable
importance in determining its performance.. If there i turbulent fiow, the heat transfer will
be by convection and can be much more rapid than in the case of streamline fiow. On the
other hand it is neces ary to impart considerable energy to a fluid in order to produce turbulence, and this means an increa ed absorption of power by the radiator.
GE ERALIZATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF A CORE TO OBTAIN THOSE OF A
RADIATOR.

OMPLETE

In considering the relations between the conditions under which a section of core operates
when in a complete radiator, and the te t conditions u ed in the laboratory, there are een to be
two general cla es of locations in which a radiator may be placed on a plane. "When th~ air
fiow around and through the radiator i not aiIected by the urrounding portions of the plane,
the radiator is said to be in an unobstructed position. In thi ca e there i no reciproc ,1 eITect
of the radiator on the other part of the plane, and the properties of a radiator in uch a po ition
may be computed from the re nlts of laboratory te Ls.
When the air flow through the radiator i aITected by other parts of the plane, it is aid
to be in an ob tructed position. Such a radiator ha a marke 1 effect on the properties of urrounding portion of the plane, and the effects chargeable to it are not related in' a imple manner
to the propertie of its core.
I n order to obtain the prol ertie of a radiator when in place from the properties of the
core as determined by laboratory te t ,it is nece ary to know (1) the condition of u e of each
part of the core, i. e., air flow, water fiow, and temperatnres i (2) the effect of header, piping,
etc. ; and (3) the reciprocal effect of the radiator (especially the air flow through it) on other
par ts of the plane.
AIR FLOW TIIROUGII TIIE RADIATOR.

The mass flow of air through a radiator in an unobstructed position may be btained
directly from the mass flow constant of the core, the free air speed to which the core. is subjected, and the air den ity. The free-air peed will u ually be the plane speed, augmented by
any effect of the propeller-slip stream. For a radiator in an ob tructed position, be mass

221

flow of air can not ea ily be computed. It is hoped to make meaSUTements of this mass flow
in obstructed positions in a serie of tests in flight.
TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE.

As noted above, the temperature difference selected for expressing the energy dissipated
was 30 chosen that the results can be applied at once to a radiator of any size by using the mean
temperature of the water. Tbe latter may be found from the entering temperature, the amount
of heat to be dissipated, a,nd the water flow. It is therefore possible to regard an entire radiator
as having a mean temperatUTe, and as the air entering all parts of the radiator will commonly
have the same temperature, the mean temperature difIerence for the radiator is easily found.
FLOW OF WATER.

The linear velocity of the water in the tubes determine tbe turbulent condition of the flow
and ,should be kept above a certain value for each type of core. The total quantity of water
flowing per unit time determines the temperature drop in Lhe water, and thus afi"ects the temperature difference.
Er ERGY DISSIPATED.

The laboratory tesLs of a core will give the energy di sipated under "sLandard JJ conditions
for a unit frontal area of core, and for any mass flow. If the mas flow is known, the total heat
dissipaLed will be found from the Lest results and Lhe frontal area of the core. Oonversely, if
the heat to be dissipated is known, the required frontal area of core can be determined. The
amount of heat to be dissipated is a subject that will bear some study under actual flight conditions. In particular, tbe effect of the · air that passes through a nose radiator, in cooling
directly the walls of the engine jackets, should be determined, for it is an effect with which the
radiator (or the position) should be credited.
HEAD RESISTANCE.

The head resistance of a radiator placed in an unobstructed position may be obtained
directly from that of the core. It is roughly proportional to the frontal area, but includes
the effect of headers and connections. For an obstructed position, if the mass flow of air is
known, the head resistance a/the core will be the arne as th t given in an unobstructed position
when at such a speed as gives the same mass fiow. But thls value represents only that part
of the total resistance chargeable to the radiator which is due to tbe pressure difference on its
two faces. The resistance which other parts of the plane offer to the air which bas passed
tbrougb the radiator may be very considerable. Also, if the front of tbe fuselage has to be
enlarged in order to accommodate a large nose radiator, this may cause a very great increase
in the resistance of the fuselage, all of which is chargeable to the radiator. The resistance of
obstructed radiators requires special study.
POWEl~

ABSORBED.

The power absorbed by an unobstructed radiator may be obtained from that of tbe core
as given, by a laboratory test witb corrections for beaders and connections. Since, bowever, it
depends upon tbe lift-drift ratio of the plane (it has been computed for a ratio of 5.4), a
special computation using the actual lift-drift ratio of the plane will give a better value.
The values given with the results of tests are intended chiefly for comparative purposes.
In obstructed positions the power absorbed must be specially determined.
FIGURE OF MERIT.

The figure of merit of a radiator in an unobstructed position will for comparative' purposes
be equal to that of the core. For obstructed positions it must be specially computed. It will
always be less tban that of the same radiator in an unobstructed position with the same mass
flow of air.

(b) Air speed in the open.
(5) Power needed to circulate water through the core, as dependent on-(a) Nature of th€ core.
(b) Rat~ of water flow.
Point (5) has been covered by Report Nu . 63, Part II, and is entirely distinct f rom the
others. The following paragraphs describe (a) the apparatus, (b) the method of taking
observations, (e) the method of computing the results, for the first four.
Test Specimens.

The specimens tested for head resistance were plain sections of co re without water boxes or
other attachments. They varied in size from approximately 6 inches square to approximately
12 inches by 24 inches and 16 mches sq llare.
Those tested for rate of heat dissipation were uniform in size and fittings. The cores were
8 inches square, with water boxes 1 inch deep, as shown in Fig. 1. The mtrlJ.lJce and exit water
pipes were fitted onto brass tubing It inches deep and It inches in diameter, which were inserted into each water box. Just inside the water box was a baffle of brass to equalize t he
water flow through the core.
(1) CORE CHARACTERISTICS.

Th3 cor e charcteristics determined were :
(1) Dimensions of the water tubes, length (parallel to the direction of water flow), depth
(parallel to the direction of air flow), thickness (perpendicular to previous two), hydraulic radius
(ratio of area of a section perpendicular to the direction of water flow to its perimeter).
(2) Dimensions of air tubes, depth (same directi.on as depth above), and hydrau lic radius.

(4) Extent and distribution of the cooling surface.
(5) Weight of the core empty and filled with water.
(6) . ature and thickness of the metal.
(7) Shape of the air and water passages.
DIMENSIONS OF THE WATER TUBES .

The apparatus used to measure the cross section of the water tubes is shown in figuro 2.
A radiator specimen, R, with water tubes t-t, was placed upright on a support. Water from a
graduated burette B was admitted into the radiator until the water level was a little way above
the entrance to the water tubes. Suppose this level WIlS h2 • This and the water level in the
burette B were read. The cock Owa opened and watel admitted to the radiator until another
level h was reached, when readings of the gauge and burette were taken again. When from Ii to
10 different levels had been observed and a level hlJ near the top of the specimen reached, the
burette was moved to po ition 1 and readings taken while emptying the radiator.
The burette B was calibrated by weighing its water content at different level. The :Eine
dividing engine of the Division of Weights and Measures was used to calibrate the gauge.
This was read (while taking observations) to 0.01 cm. and the volume to 1 cc.
Volumes in cc. were plotted again t gauge leyels in cm. and the points found to lie en a
straight line. If the lope of this line is denoted by m, the area of th water tubes by a, and the
area of the gauge by g, then since all the wat6r leaving the burette goe into the radiator and
gauge and raises the level of each by the same amount,
(1)

m=a+g

The constant g was determined previously by using in the gauge known volumes of water.
Two tests were made on each specimen. If the resulting values of a differed more than 3 per
cent, other tests were made. The number of water tubes was counted. The depth of the tllbes
was measured with a rule and calipers. When the water tubes were not vertical, e. g., in the
hexagonal cell types, the area above (which is, of course, the horizontal area) was projeeted
onto a plane normal to the direction of the water flow. This projected area divided by the
number of tubes gave the area of one tube. A further division by the depth gave the thiclrness.
Twice the sum of the thickness and depth is the perimeter, and this divided into area gave the
hydraulic radius. The water-tube length in inches of a foot square section is 12/ F, if F is the
above projection factor.
a was expressed in square feet per foot of core width, so that the water content of the <~ore
was 62.4 a, 62.4 being the density of water in pounds per cubic foot.
DIMENSIONS OF THE AIR TUBES.

The method used in finding the cross sectional area of the air tubes was similar to the one
just described. The specimen was clamped face down onto the top of a shallow tank 7 in:lhes
square and 2 inches deep. The rim of the tank was 1 inch broad and was faced with a ~ ,trip
of soft rubber, so that the edge of the specimen was sealed water-tight. The tank contained
two openings to which rubber tubes could be attached, one leading to the burette and the other
to the gauge as before.
The observations and computations were exactly the same as in the case of the water tu bes.
Micrometer measurements on the inside of the air tubes and a direct count of their nunber
determined the perimeter of the air tubes, and when combined with the area above, the hydrfmlic

radius also. These observations gave an independent value of the air-tube area which agreed
well with the results of the above method.
The air-tube depth (identical with the core depth) was measured with a rule and calipers.
FREE AREA OF THE AIR PASSAGES.

Since the specimens were seldom exactly 8 inches square, careful measurements of the true
frontal area were made and divided into the air-tube area to give the per cent of free area.
EXTE T AND DI TRIBUTION OF TIlE COOLING S RFACE .

When the au: tubes had a simple shape, circular, hexagonal, rectangular, etc., so that the
relation between the area and the perimeter was known, the air-tube measurements above
sufficed to determine the cooling surface, since this is the product of the perimeter of a tube by
the number of tubes by the core depth. (Note : A slight correction had to be made sometimes
on account of the enlargement at the edges.) Inspection of the radiator construction showed
what portion of the surface was direct, i. e., formed part of a water tube or water box wall,
and what indirect, i. e., received heat from the water only by conduction along a metal fin of
some sort. (E. g., in a Harrison hexagonal cell type, two sides of each air cell formed part
of a water tube. i-Ience one-third of this part of the core was rated as direct surface and
two-thirds as indirect.) The edges were all rated indirect.
With the irregular shapes, many dillerent methods of solution were used, depending on
the nature of the irregularity. Every effort was made to determine these values to 2 per cent,
but in a few ca es the values could not be fixed with certainty to better than 10 per cent. Two
observers worked independently and compared their results, so that large errors were not apt
to escape detection.
WEI GIlT OF TIlE CORE.

. The weight of the core empty was found by weighing it with the water boxes removed on
a balance. The water content added to this gave the weight of the core filled .
ATURE AND TIlICKNE S OF TIIE METAL.

All the specimens tested were made of copper or brass, as determined by inspection. The
metal thiclmess was measured with a stage micrometer reading to 0.005 mID. The readings
however, were not very uniform, so the values obtained are not accurate to that degree, e. g.,
two readings would give 0.00 and 0.010 mID.
SllAPE OF TilE AIR AND WATER PASSAGES.

This was determined by inspection and some rough measurements and sketched on the
curve sheets.
(2) HEAT DISSIPATED.

Two distinct sets of measurements ,,'ere made on the heat dissipated and two different
sets of apparatus used. Both made use of -inch square wind tunnels and were made so that
the same specimen could be tested in both tunnels without any alterations. One tunnel was
inclosed in a tank which could be partially exhausted and used hot water to supply heat to
the radiator. The other was an open tunnel in the room and supplied heat by means of steam.

CLOSED TUNNEL.

A diagrammatic sketch of this tunnel is shown in figure 3. Air flow was produced by the
suction of a 15-inch Sirocco fan driven by a belt from a 220-volt, direct-current shunt motor,
rated at 7! horsepower; 1l0-volt current could also be used. A further adjustment afforded
by rheostats in both field and armature enabled any speed through the tunnel between 15 and
60 miles per hour to be obtained. Both the fan and the tunnel proper were inclosed in a steel

tank 5 feet long and 3 feet in diameter. This was sufficiently air tight to allow the maintenance
within it of a pressure of 30 or 40 cm. of Hg.
At the tunnel entrance a honeycomb of sheet-metal cells, 1 inch square and 3 inches de~p,
served to break up vortices and straighten the air flow . Following this in order came:
(1) A Pitot grid to measure the air speed.
(2) A resistance thermometer to measure the air temperature.
(3) A thermocouple grid to measure the rise in the air temperature as it pasHed
through the radiator.
(4) A piezometer ring to measul:e , the drop in the static pressure of the air.
(5) The specimen under test.
(6) The other piezometer ring.
(7) The other thermocouple grid.
(8) The fan .
(9) Conical guide vanes to deflect the air down the tank.
(10) A wet and dry bulb hygrometer to measure the humidity.
(11) A cold-water radiator to cool the heated air.
Water flow was produced by a centrifugal pump driven by a belt from a one-horsepower
direct-current shunt motor. The water line is sketched in figure 5. The resistance of ';he
heating coils to the water flow was quite large compared with the rest of the line, so that h igh
rates of water flow (above 11 gals./min.) could only be obtained by opening the by-pass around
the heater. A thermostat maintained a constant temperature at the radiator inlet. After ';he
heater followed in order:
(1) A Hg. thermometer to regulate the thermostat.
(2) A set of thermocouples to measure the temperature chop in the water.
(3) The specimen under test.
(4) The other half of the thermocouple set.
(5) A Venturi meter to measure the water flow.
(6) A drain.
(7) A tank with a free water surface to open the system.
Oonstruction and caZibmtion oj the appamtus: The air-flow measurement offered some
difficulty. A Thomas meter was first used for the purpose, but owing to the high air speed a.nd
very irregular velocity distribution, it proved very unsatisfactory and had to be discarded.
In its place was installed the Pitot grid. This contained 16 dynamic openings, one at the center
of each 2 inch square section of the tunnel. All these opened into one tube leading to one
arm of an inclined water gauge. A piezometer ring measured the static pressure and led to the
other side of the gauge. A piece of sheet copper was carefully inlaid in the tunnel for a distance
of 6t inches, so that the air passed over a very smooth surface before reaching the piezometer
ring. Four square copper tub,es were soldered onto the back of this ring 4t inches from its
entrance, at the point of the dynamic openings. At !-inch intervals all around this, hole:, !
mm. in diameter were drilled. The burr was carefully scraped off the holes, and then the he,les
were cleaned out and smoothed with a hand drill .
One of the inclined water gauges is ' hown in figure 4. The e were calibrated in each
position by connecting them in parallel with a V tube containing light oil of a known den ity,
A zero reading (scale reading with zero pressme difference) wa taken before and after a run.
Both the zero and the calibration remained en ibly constant over a period of many weeks . I

ring. This la t varied lightly around zero , showing that the tatic pressure was constant across
the channel within 3 per cent of the velocity head sought. When the velocity wa integrated
over the channel it was found to agree within It per cent with the velocity indicated by the
Pitot grid at all speeds.
A barometer was connected with this piezometer ring so as to read directly the air pressure
at the Pitot.
The resis tance thermometer was made in the form hown in figure 6. No . 40 nickel wire
was used, inclosed in a 0.5 mm. copper tube. This wire wa calibrated by the thermometer
section of the bureau and found to satisfy the f9110wing equation:
(2)

R=103.367 (1+.003414 t.+.00000419 t2).

When R=resi tance of the wire in ohms.
t= temperature of the wire in °C.
The bridge used to read R was calibrated by the ' Electrical Division of the bureau and the correction found to be negligible. A rough calculation showed that the maximum error caused
by neglecting the lead re istance amounted to °.15 C. Thi produced an error of -0.2 per cent
in the re ult.
At fir t an attempt was made to measure the temperature ri e in the air through the
Thomas meter and through the radiator with 200 ohm resistance thermometers in which in ulated nickel wire was trung on a lattice work of iron wire. Owing to the varying stresse on
the wire caused by the air tream, the resistance changed 0 much as to vitiate the measurements of small temperature differences (about 1° C.).
The thermocouple grids proved much more satisfactory. They each consisted of 25
copper-constantan junctions spaced at equal intervals over the channel.
Calibration showed that they satisfied the following equation:
de
(3)
dt = .933 + .0022 t
or
(4)
e = .933 + .0011 t2
where e=E. M. F. in millivolts when cold junctions were at 0° C. This E. M. F. was measured
by means of a Morris E. Leeds' l5,000-ohm potentiometer, sensitive to 10 microvolts.
The tatic rings about the radiator were constructed exactly like the piezometer ril1g
de cribed above, save that the copper ril1g was 2 inche long.
The Venturi was connected to a mercury pressure gauge and the whole contrivance calibrated by weighing the water discharged through it in a known time.
A 10-foot gravity head was originally u ed in tead of the pressure of the pump to produce
the water flow through the radiator, but this was discarded because it did not give sufficiently
high rates of flow. The pipes were insulated with magnesia pipe lagging 1 inch thiclc
Many methods of arranging the thermocouple so as to mea ure accurately the temperature
drop in the water were tried before a succe ful one wa found. A single couple in the inlet
and outlet pipe proved too erratic. Four couple in eries in the center of the box itself failed
to give a good temperature integration beside~ giving such a small reading that it was much
affected by small thermal E. M. F.'s in the line. Twenty-one couples arranged in three groups
of seven each, one in the center of the water box and one on each side, gave very good readings and a good temperature integration but proved too fragile to withstand the hard usage
received in changing specimen .
Finally 21 couples, about one-half inch apart, were incased in a copper tube in the form
of a spiral coil and placed in the inlet and outlet water pipes. Tliese proved very succe sful
in every respect.

Th y mea ured only the temperature drop in the water. To measure the ab olute temperature of the water, an extra comtantan lead from the firat junction r an to a cold junction
placed in an oil bath out ide the tank ( ee fig. 7). The temperature of thi bath wa measured
by a mercury thermometer graduated to 0.10 C., which had been calibrated by the thermometer
section of the bureau.
The single couple just referred to and the 21 couples in series were calibrated separately
and found to satisfy the following equations respectively:
e=39.10t+.04t 2
e=39.97t+ .0314t 2

e is here expressed in microvolts per couple, t in degree~ C.
lI1ethod of observing.- The machinery was first set in motion and allowed to run unjl the
temperature conditions became steady. Two observers worked simultaneously, one rc ading
the electrical instruments that measured the temperatures, the other reading the pr,~ssure
gauges and the hygrometer. The sample observation sheets, figures and 9, give such a set.
The time of each observation was recorded in small figures above it.
Aiter complete readings had been taken under one set of conditions, one of then. was
changed and another set of readings taken. A complete set of observations on one specimen
included sets under atmospheric conditions with constant water flow and varying air speeds;
with constant water and air flow, but varying air speeds and pressures; with different constant
air speeds, but varying water flow. A special set was taken on one specimen under atmos heric
conditions with constant air and water flow, but with varying inlet water temperatures.
Method of computing results.-The given data, figure 10, sufficed to determine:
(1) Pressure drop in the air through the radiator Ib.-wt. /ft.2
(2) R,ate of water flow in gal./min./ft. width of core and speed in it./min.
(3) Rate of air flow in Ib./sec./ft. 2 frontal core area.
(4) Air density in Ib./ft.3
(5) Heat given up by the water in horsepower per 100° F. difference between mean
temperature of water and entrance temperature of the air per square foot frontal
area of core.
(6) Heat received by the air in same units.
These results were used to plot the following curves:

where 4.69 is a factor found by calibration, F is a factor found by calibration to reduce gauge
readings to cm. fIg ., its value being 1.008. 386.2 is a computed conversion factor.
All the gauges had temperature coefficients, but these gave rise to negligible corrections
over the annual temperature range of the room.
Air density.-Let P = air pressure at the Pitot in mm. Hg.
t = air temperature at the Pitot in °C.
d l = density dry air at the Pitot in lbs./ft. 3
then the gas laws as applied to air gave

In addition let d = true density of air in Ib./ft. 3 and d = dl+C.

R was found from the wet and dry bulb readings by means of an ordinary chart for the
purpose. I n the case of the reduced pressure runs, the value found thus required a correction

peratures to O. °5 C. A Pitot grid and two piezometer rings were installed just as in the inclosed
tunnel. In addition two other rings 7 inches from the radiator faces were used.
The barometer was in the room, so that ob ervations had to be made on the pressure
difference between the air in the tunnel and in the room: This was accomplished by opening
the low-pressure side of the pressure drop gauge to the air in the room.
A recording hygrometer registered the humidity with sufficient accuracy.
The heat di s ipated by the radiator was supplied by the condensation of dry steam .
Figure 12 gives a sketch of the apparatus used to control and measure the steam flow. Steam
from the high-pressure mains (100 Ibs./in. 2 was pas ed through a valve where its pressure was
reduced to about 10 Ibs./in.2 . A V- haped pipe with an opening at the bottom drained out most
of the water. The team passed on through a coil where it was superheated about 50° C.,
through a plug cock where its pressure fell to atmospheric, through a eparator where a mercury thermometer recorded it temperature, through the radiator specimen where most of it
condensed and through another separator out of which the water dropped into a weighing tank.
Originally a thermometer was in erted in the lower water box of the specimen, but the
water temperature was found to differ so lightly from the temperature of condensation that
the heat lost by the water in cooling could be safely neglected. A fan blew the steam away
from the tunnel. The steam line was insulated in the same manner a the water line in the
other tunnel. The radiator specimen was insulated on the sides with cork board one-half inch
thick. The water boxes were not so well protected, but on account of the small surface exposed
and the comparatively quiet air in contact with them, the heat lost thus could not have been
more than a few tenths of a per cent at moderate peeds. In fact, in some of the early experiments, the steam condensed when the channel was blocked so no air flow existed wa measured
and found to be less than 1 per cent of the total.
Method of observing.- The exhaust valves in the steam line were opened, the water drained
off and the blower started. When the water was out of the line and the steam flowing well,
the gas heater was lighted, and the blower adju ted to give the desired speed. After steady
conditions of steam flow and temperature had been attained, one observer set the balance
slightly ahead of the actual weight and started a stop-watch when the pointer crossed the
zero line. The balance was set ahead of the weight (from 1 to 10 pounds, according to the probable rate of conden ation), and one observer from then on recorded steam temperatures. At
the same time the other ob erver read the gauges and the air temperature. A set of readings
was taken at regular intervals (everyone or two minute, according to the duration of the run).
About a minute before the a signed ·weight wa reached, a bell warned the observers, who
prepared to observe the time when the pointer cro sed the line aaain. At each speed two or
three runs were taken as a check. The time interval employed wa from three to six minute,
and could ea ily be mea ured to 1 second. The halance weighed correctly to 0.01 pound. An
observation sheet (fig. 13) is reproduced .
Method of computing results.-As in the case of the inclosed tunnel the observed data
sufficed to determine(1) Pressure drop in the air through the radiator.
(2) Rate of air flow.
(3) Heat given up by the steam.
Pressure drop.-This result was computed as in the other tunnel with one addition.
Because the piezometer rings were 7 inches from the radiator, (1) was corrected by subtracting
from it the pressure drop in 14 inche of unob tructed channel.
Air fiow.-The computation was the same as before.

(3) POWER EXPENDED IN CARRYING THE RADIATOR.

The measurement needed to determine this quantity were made in a tunnel whose cro s
section was large compared with the dimen ions of the radiator tested, in contradistinction to
the heat measurements, which were all made in bulkhead tunnel . Figure 15 shows a sketch
of this large tunnel.
It wa of octagonal ection, 54 inches in in ide diameter. The entering air passed through
a honeycomb of heet metal cells, 3 inches in diameter and 12 inches deep, through a straight
section of 25 feet long, and out through a conical difIu e1'. A four-blade propeller fan driven
by a 75-hor epower direct-current motor drew air through the tunnel. A continuous speed
range from 15 to 90 mile per hour could be obtained by adjustments provided by rheostats in
both field and armature and two voltages, 110 and 240. A Pitot tube read on an inclined water
gauge measured the air speed to 1 per cent.
The head resi tance wa measured directly on a balance, figure 16. This wa mounted a little
below the floor of the tunnel, and con i ted es entially of a bell crank suspended by thin flexible
steel strips, with a horizontal arm on which weights could be hung below the tunnel, and a
vertical arm passing up through the tunnel floor to support the specimen. A econd vertical arm
extended below the fulcrum and carried counterpoise for lowering the center of gravity, and a
second hort horizontal arm with adju table counterpoise provided a zero adjustment . The
joint at the tunnel floor was rendered air-tight by an oil trap. The vertical arm that supported
the specimen was extensible] and was fitted at the top with a detachable brass block. This was
screwed to a plate t inch or less in thickness, soldered to the lower side of the specimen under test.

CALIBRATION OF APPARATUS.

The tunnel cro s section wa explored with a movable Pitot and found to be uniform within
inches from the wall. Silk thread strung from a fine verti.~al
WIre showed that there were considerable di turbances in the air stream in the neighborhood of
the pecimen, but no appreciable one within inches of the tunnel wall. Thi wa taken to
indicate that the tunnel was large enough to give free air condition.
The balance was calibrated by applying known horizontal forces to the vertical arm and
observing the balancing forces on the horizontal arm. This gave the correct factor by whlch
to multiply the balance reading, for different lengths of the vertical arm, to obtain the true force .
Ordinarily a length was chosen which made this factor unity, so that the force was read direclly .
JIethod of observing. - The radiator specimen (without water boxe ) was mounted on ·jhe
vertical arm and the di tance from its center to the fulcrum adjusted to the de ired value. To
find t.he po ition of no yaw, a specimen was set at various angles, the po ition of minimum hEiad
re~istance a sumed to represent zero yaw, and a reference point marked on the tunnel wall by
sighting acro the front of the radiator. The same re ult could be obtained by sighting throt.gh
the radiator tubes at the honeycomb at the tunnel entrance. In other case, the angle of yaw
was measured roughly by sighting acro s the front of the ection at a scale mounted on ·;he
tunnel wall. Becau e of fluctuations in the air speed, two observers took simultaneous re.ldings on the b lance and Pitots, since there was no sen ible Jag between the two in trument
ine points were usually observed.
Method of computing.-The apparent head re istance was obtained by multiplying ·;he
readings by the proper factor. By subtracting from this the force on the supporting arm
(determined by a previous calibration) the force on the specimen was found . This divided by
the frontal area gave the head resistance, in lb. wt. / ft.2 .

air density and speed computed. The experiments, however, soon showed that the usual
formula for the re ist.ance of an airplane, i. e.,
(21)

R =BdV2 (B = a con tant)

also applied to these tests.
Accordingly a value of d in the neighborhood of the observed values was selected and u3ed
in (20) to compute V. Thus, neither the actual speed nor density were u ed, but such a valu e
of Vas gave, when combined with ds (the standard density) the observed head resistance; for

corresponding to 65 ° F., 29.17 in Hg, 40 per cent humidity.
(4) MASS FLOW OF AIR THROUGH THE CORE.
PRELn.UNARY ATTEMPTS.

Three different methods were tried for measuring the mass flow of air through the core
before a satisfactory one was found.
(1) A careful and persistent attempt was made to measure the flow with a small Pitot
tube behind the core, and in positions ranging from well within the cell to a few inches behind
the core, but it appeared to be out of the question to use a Pitot tube in the turbulent air
encountered.
(2) Threads were attached to the rear edges of the radiatoi" to define the stream, in the
hope that the air passing through the core could be followed to a position where the flow would
not be too turbulent for the use of a Pitot tube, and that in such a position it would be possible
to measure the velocity, and the area of cross section of the air that had passed through the
core. But it was found that, even aside from the difficulty introduced by the tendency of the
pull on the threads to straighten them, so that they would not truly follow the streamline, the
flapping of the thread was too great, and consequently their position too indefinite to allow
of measurement of the area included between them.
(3) A hot-wire anemometer was tried, and gave promise of very fair results, but before
it had been thoroughly tried out, a simpler method was discovered and the use of the instrument was discontinued.
APPARATUS USED.

The method finally adopted employed a specially constructed Venturi, a longitudina
section of which i shown in figure 17. The cylindrical throat and the two cones were made
up from sheet copper soldered together, and the joints filed down into curves of stream-line
form. A copper tube led out from a single small needle hole in the side of the throat. A
piece of sheet iron bent into cylindrical form was soldered over the cones extending from 1
inches before the front cone nearly to tho rear end and covering the central contracted portion,
which would else cause considerable resista,nce to the air stream. A second needle hole before
the front cone was connected to a small tube which ran back along the outer urface, and turned
up where it reached the tube coming from the throat. An inclined water gauge measured
the pressure difference. Three wires soldered to the sides of the Venturi passed through the
cells of the radiator, and were bent over in front so as to fasten the Venturi firmly in place
behind the radiator.

244

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
CALIBRATION OF THE VENTURI.

Tests in the inclosed tunnel with eight different sections of widely differing types of core
gave nearly the same pressure difference for same air flow through the tunnel and this was vl~ry
close to that given when no radiator at all was used. For ordinary types of core this was tlUe
within about 3 per cent and with cores in which the air flow was very much obstructed within
6 per cent.
0 high degree of accuracy is claimed for this, but it was very convenient s.nd
sufficient for the purpose.
A calibration curve was obtained by running the Venturi in the open in the large w:nd
tunnel against the Pitot tube of the tunnel. The square root of the Venturi pres ure difIerence (in gms.fcm Z) was plotted against the mass flow as computed from the tunnel Pitot. This
is the product of the air speed in feet sec. by ds (.0750 lb./ft. 3 ). The re ulting curve was V.3ry
flat, almost linear.
ix calibrations at different times during a period of six months gave
dentical curves.
OTE.-This calibration wa in terms of mass flow in pounds per second per square f.)ot
of Venturi mouth, and hence mass flow through radiators i per square foot frontal-core area,
and not of air-tube area.
Method of observing.-The specimen under observation was mounted in the 54-inch wmd
tunnel in the same manner as for head resistance measurements, the Venturi was attached
to the rear face, its pressure tubes connected to an inclined water gauge by means of tu· es
passing through a hole in the tunnel floor, and simultaneous reading taken of its press lIre
difference and the air speed in the tunnel. These readings were taken at from 9 to 15 differ nt
speeds for each radiator.
Method of computing.- Tte Venturi gauge reading was mUltiplied by the gauge factor to
obtain grams per cm Z • The square root of this was computed and used as argument to de1.ermine the mass flow from the calibration curve. The mass flow was then plotted against Vs
for each radiator.
As in the case of the head resistance, the actual air density was not needed . '1'he re~lOn
for this is slightly different however. The Venturi really measures velocity, just as the PiLot,
so that relation between its readings and those of the Pitot tubes furnish a measure of the
ratio of the amount of air going through the radiator to the amount that would pas through
that section if the radiator. were absent. It seems permissible to assume that this ratio is
independent of the air density, because the viscosity is known to be independent of the densi.ty,
and it effect in this case is not large anyway .

RESUME.

The present report deals with the head resistance of a number of common types of radiator
cores at different speeds in free air, as measured in the wind tunnel at the Bureau of Standards .
This work was undertaken in connection with exhaustive tests conducted at the bmeau to
determine the characteri tics of various types of radiator cores, and in particular to develop
the best type of radiator for airplanes.
Some 25 specimens of core were tested, including practically all the general types now is
use, except the flat plate type, and the following is a summary of the most important results
obtained:
1. The head 1'e istance of various types of core varies greatly. The lowest is Candler
~-inch hexagonal tube
o. 78), 8 pounds per square foot at 90 miles per hom, while the highest
is the :fin and tube type (I o. 92), 22 pounds per square foot at 90 miles per hom.
2. The shape and size factors are insignificant for the range covered (8 by 8 inches to 16
by 16 inches and 12 by 24 inches), there being no perceptible variation in the resistance pel
square foot.
3. The effect of inclining the smface of the radiator to the air stream (yawing) is, in general,
to increase the resi tance considerably for angles up to at least 30° to 45 °. Cores of special
construction vary greatly in this characteristic.
4. The hor'sepower absorbed by the radiator in being lifted and pushed through the air is
high, being, at 100 miles per hom, roughly 5 per cent to 20 per cent or more of the total power
developed by the engine. It thus appears that a small gain in radiator performance may be
very appreciable at high speeds.
5. The importance of head resistance in determining the value of a radiator core depends
greatly on its position in the machine.
6. The work here presented may prove of value in determining the effect of the radiator on
the aerodynamical properties of the machine in which it is placed.

DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS.

The wind tunnel in which this work was done is of octagonal section, 54 inches in inside
diameter. The entering air passes through a honeycomb of sheet-metal cells of about 3 inches
diameter and 1 foot depth, then through a straight section about 25 feet long, and out through
a conical diffuser, at the end of which is a four-blade propeller fan driven by a 75-horsepower
direct cmrent motor, which draws air through the tunnel. The motor may be driven on either
120 or 240 volts, and further speed control is obtained by means of a field rheostat, giving ranges
of air speeds from 32 to 53 miles per hom on 120 volts and from 66 to about 90 miles per hom
on 240 volts. The air speed is measmed by a Pitot tube, whose pressme is read on an inclined
water gauge. Both the Pitot tube and the gauge have been calibrated with some care, and
the measmements of air speed are good within 1 per cent.

DESCRIPTION OF THE BALANCE.

The balance on which the head resistance was obtained is designed to measme both , ·e1'tical and horizontal force.;;, but since the present work is concerned only with the horizon ~al ,
we shall describe only the parts used, i. e., the" drift arm." The balance is mounted a ILtie
below the floor of the tunnel and con ists essentially of a bell cr ank suspended by thin flexi ble
steel strips, with one arm horizontal, on which weights may be hung below the tunnel, and
one ver tical arm passing up through the tunnel floor, supporting the specimen. A second Ye1'tical arm extend.;; below the fulcrum, carrying counterpoises for lowering the center of grav: ty;
a second short horizontal arm with an adjustable counterpoise provides for zero adjustmE.nt ;
and an oil trap makes an air-tight joint at the floor of the tunnel. The vertical arm supporting the specimen is extensible and is fitted at the top with a detachable brass block, which is
screwed to a plate k inch or Ie s in thickness soldered to the lower side of the radiator sect: on.
It will be evident that the balance measmes-on the horizontal arm-the moment of the
head resistance, but if the di tances are known from the fulcrum to the center of pressme on
the radiator, and to the point of application of the weights on the horizontal arm, the acLual
force is easily obtained. It is not convenient to measure the e di tances with accm acy, but
their ratio was determined by means of a calibration of the balance. This calibration was
made by applying lmown horizontal forces to the vertical arm and observing the balan<.ing
forces on the horizontal arm, readings being taken with the vertical arm extended to three
different lengths.
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS.

A preliminary investigation, with a radiator :first in one position and then inverted, showed
that we may assume the center of pressm~ on the section to be at it geometrical center. A
similar test showed the resistance of several cores to be the same whichever face wa preseLted
to the wind. An exploration of the cross section of the tunnel with a second Pitot tube showed
that to within 6 or 8 inches of the wall the velocity distribution is uniform to about 1 per Cjnt.
To test whether the conditions truly represent a velocity in free air, silk threads were attached
to a fine vertical wire strung about 6 inches in front of a large-sized specimen of high bead
resi tance (Spirex, 16 by 16 inches). The threads showed a considerable cmvature of the
stream lines around and close to the section, but no appreciable cmvatme within 8 inches of the
tunnel wall. This condition was taken to indicate that the effect of the radiator was confi ned
well within the cro s section of the tunnel.
METHOD OF TAKING OBSERVATIONS.

The method of taking readings is as follows: The radiator (bare core, without water boxes)
is JIlounted on the vertical arm of the balance and the distance measured from its center ~o a
fixed point on the arm. The distance from this point to the fulcrum was determined by the
calibration mentioned above. To determine the position of no yaw, a specimen was set at
various angles, the position of minimum head resistance assumed to represent zero yaw, and a
r eference point mill'ked on the tunnel wall by sighting acr oss the front of the section. It was
found that the alignment could be obtained equally well by sighting through the t ubes of the
r adiator at the honeycomb at the tunnel entrance. F or yawed runs, the angle of yaw was measured roughly by sighting across the front of the section at a scale mounted on the tunnel wall.
The air speed is quite sensitive to changes in voltage on the power line, and because of fluctuations it was necessary for two observers to take simultaneous readings on the balance and the
Pitot tube gauge. There is, however, practically no lag between the two instruments, and very
satisfactory readings can be obtained. In most cases observations were made at nine different
speeds.
METHOD OF COMPUTATION.

The computation of results is simple. The head r esistance is obtained by subtractio.g a
correction for the supporting arm, which was determined by a "blank " run without a radi:1tor ,
from the weights hung on the horizontal arm of the balance (including equivalent weight 0 :: the

rider) and multiplying by the proper factor to give the force on the vertical arm. All results
are reduced to a frontal area of 1 square foot. Horsepower absorbed in sustaining the weight
and pushing it through the air is given by the equation

r = air density, in lb ./cu. ft.
subscripts (( a" and (( s" denote actual and (( standard" or reduced values, respectively, and.

The air speed is given by the equation
(2)

In accordance 'with aerodynamic practice, and with the results of observations on pressure
drop through radiator sections in a closed tunnel, head resistance has been assumed to be proportional to air density, and all results have been reduced to an assumed density of 0.0750
pounds per cubic foot (corresponding to a temperature of 65° F ., pressure of 29.7 in. mercury,
and humidity of 40 per cent).
The correction for density may be made by the equation

('0).

R sara
=R

(3)

It is less laborious, however, to apply the correction for density in the computation of air speed
in the following manner. Head resistance has been shown to he very nearly proportional to
the square of the air speed, as well as to the first power of · the densij,y, and may be expressed
by the equation
(4)
R = KrP.

Resistance at (( standard" air densi ty will be
Rs=KrsV2,

which is the relation shown in the curves. The product (K1's) may be regarded as a single
proportionality factor, and the same value of this factor would be obtained (and the same
curve plotted), if instead of multiplying Ra by ~ to obtain R s, the value Ra should be substira
stuted for Rs in equation (5 ), and V2 should be divided by~. In other words, by substitution
from equation (3 ), equation (5) may be Wl'itten

DESCRIPTIO

OF THE TABLES A D CURVES.

The sections tested compri e a number of different types, whose characteristics are givEn
in Table 1. Two curves are included for each type of core, showing respectively the hes d
resistance in pounds per square foot frontal area, and the horsepower absorbed. The latt'~r
includes, as indicated above, both that used in pushing the radiator through the air, and th:tt
required with a lift-ch'ift ratio of 5.4 to sustain the weight of the empty core, i. e., not including
the weight of water contained in the core. Extrapolations were made by mean of logarithmic
plots, and the extrapolated parts of the curves are indicated by dotted lines.
In order to facilitate comparison b tween the types, Table 2 is given, showing head rosiE tance and horsepower at speeds of 30, 60, 90, and 120 miles per hom:. It should be noted, ho'vever, that all values at 120 miles per hour and some at 90 miles per hour are given by extrapolation, and that the values of "k" are only roughly approximate. The real re ults are shown hy
the curves. To determine " k," for the equation R = k VZ, the head resistance curve was plott3d
logarithmically, and the best line with slope 2 ch'awn through the points. "k" was then cetermined from the Y intercept of this line. The line that would best fit the points had a slope
somewhat less than 2, and the line drawn with the slope 2 represents an average position, in
most cases intersecting the correct line at about 70 miles per hour. All extrapolations W(lre
made from the actual line, not with slope 2, and using a corresponding value of "k," not tbat
shown in the table.
A few sections merit special comment. The curves of the Rome-Turney X'-inch square cell
( o. 1) are made up of three curves from three izes of the section cut down twice, and the
pirex ( o. 0, 2) curves are made up from two different specimens, one 12 by 24 inches and the
other 16 by 16 inches; but in each case the discrepancies between the different curves were
within the limit of observational error. Two sections of the" Staggard" core, one 6 by 6 inches,
an~ Qne 12 by 12 inches, showed a marked difference, but it appeared that the 6-inch section
was too small, and the correction for the supporting arm too latge, to make its readings reliable.
It is accordingly omitted from this report. On sections by inches up to 16 by 16 inches or
larger, no results have be~n obt.ained that seem to conflict with the assumption that, within
the range of sizes used, the head resistance is strictly proportional to the area, and this assumption has been used for all of these sections.
In the Livingston " electrolytic" section, the water tubes are hollow flat plates with perforations, and the perforations have the effect of whistles. The core begins to whistle at a sp'3ed
miles per
of about 35 miles per hour, and five dillerent tones were noted, which merge at
hOUl' into an ear-splitting shriek. As might be expected, the head resistance curve is not of the
form R=kVn, and the value of "k" given in Table 2 represents the CUl've only very roughly.

°

EFFECT OF YAWING.

,

A considerable number of the specimens were tested when turned at several a'ngles to the
air stream, The results obtained on four specimens have been plotted against the anglo of
the yaw (i. e., angle between the perpendicular to the face of the radiator and the direction of
the wind stream), for various air speeds. The curves for Rome-Turney (No.1 ) and paks
Withington %-inch elliptical cell ( J o. 73 ) are given as indicating the normal behavior of a p lain
cellular radiator. The head resistance increases rapidly with the angle up to at least 30°. The
other plots are for special types which show the variations in the form of the curves. rhe
Spirex is of special interest in that it shows almost no change in head resistance (per square
foot frontal area of core) with changing angles up to nearly 30°. These curves are of interest
in connection with the possibility of controlling the amount of cooling by yawing the radiator .

HEAD RESISTANCE DUE TO RADIATORS.

APPLICATION OF THE RESULTS.

A high head resistance is not in itself a detriment to a radiator if properly placed in the
airplane. The effect of head resistance on the efficiency of a radiator in various positions is
l:)omewhat as follows:
1. A radiator placed in the open air, as between the planes or beside the fusilage, must
be of low head resistance. The accompanying horsepower curves indicate the enormous consumption of power by even the best of the radiators tested, at high air speeds. It can safely
be said that none of the radiators tested seem well suited for these locations if the airplane is
to make the speeds required at the present time. Another consideration is the probably
large volume.
2. A radiator placed in the nose of the machine is subject to very different limitations. In
this case the air has a relatively devious path to follow after pa sing through the core, and a
high head resistance in the radiator, if accompanied by a high rate of heat transfer for a small
flow of air, may not be a disadvantage. The real limit to this type of radiator is the frontal
area which may be occupied . As this is usually small, a compact type of core is of advantage.
3. In the case of a radiator placed in the wing it is even more true that head resistance is
of little detriment. With the small flow of air possible with a wing radiator, a high head resistance may simply increase the lift somewhat, and if it is brought about by using small air cells
and turbulence vanes, it will mean a high rate of heat transfer at the comparatively low air
speeds available.
It is hoped to make tests on some flat plate water tube radiators in the near future. These
are practically the only type not well represented in the present report.

PRELIMINARY REPORT ON RESISTANCE DUE TO NOSE RADIATOR. '
By R . V.

KLEINSCHMIDT.

Rf:SUMf:.

Wind-tunnel tests on a model fuselage show the following qualitative results:
(1) At any given plane speed the total resistance of a fuselage with a flat nose radiator is
increased by increasing the air flow through the radiator either by opening exit vents for the
air or by decreasing the resistance of the r adiator to passage of air. This shows that a nose
radiator, in contradi tinction to an unobstructed radi ator, should be of compact con truction
with high heat transfer for low air flows through the core, therefore requiring a core of high
resistance.
(2) With varying plane peeds the relative efficiencies of unobstructed and nose radiators
do not change.
(3) With all three widely differing types of core tried, the combined resi tance of the
fu elaae and an unobstructed radiator of given cooling capacity was from 10 or 50 per cent
Ie s than that of the fuselage with a nose radiator of the same core con truction and equivalent cooling capacity.
(4) From other experiments performed at the Bureau of Standards it is clear that there is
more chance for improvement in types of core for unobstructed positions than in types of
cores for the nose position.
RESISTAN CE DUE TO NOSE RADIATOR.

Th e present report con iders the effect of placing a radiator in the nose of a fuselage as
compared with the effect of placing a radiator of the same core construction, having an equivalent cooling capacity, in an unobstructed position and streamlining the nose of the fuselage.
The results of these tests indicate Ie difference than would be shown by comparing results
with radiators specially selected for each of the positions in which they were placed.
The results are qualitative only, but they are so striking as to indicate that the nose of
the fu elage is not a desirable location for a radiator from the point of view of head resi tance.
A model fuselage 60 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 13 inches .high was constructed with
a removable streamline nose which, when removed, allowed an 8-inch square section of r adiator
core to be placed in the nose. (ee figure 7 and 8. ) Two holes on each side of the fuselage,
inches, were cut about a foot back from the nose and fitted with adjus table
each about 1 ~ by
sliding doors. By adjusting these vents the amount of air pa sing through the nose was varied .
The model was mounted in a 54-inch wind tunnel and the head resistance measured under
the following conditions:
(1) Streamline nose on model. (No change in re istance was observed whether vents
were open or closed. )
(2) Streamline nose removed, but nose r adiator covered with a sheet of paper so that there
was no air flow through the core.

(3), (4), and (5) ose r adiator in place with varying amounts of air flow controlled by
opening the vents. Seven or eight different air speeds were tried in each case, the maximum
being about 70 miles per hour.
The results of these runs are given in plot 1 against free-air speed. They show (1) that
the streamline nose decreases the r esi tance of the fuselage by 50 per cent; and (2) that th e
total re i tance of the fuselage incr eases rapidly when air is allowed to enter the radiator, so
that a comp act type of core is desirable for this position.
Plot 2 illustrates these conclusions more clearly, since there the resist ance of the fuselage
at 60 miles per hour fr ee-air sp eed is plotted against the mass flow of air through the radiator'.
There is also plott ed the t ot al resistance of the fuselage with a streamline nose together with an
unobstructed radiator of the same core cons truction and of such size as to have a cooling
capacity equivalent to that of the nose radiator at any given mass flow. P lots 3, 4, 5, and 6 give
the same data for two other cores, 3 and 4 being for a core of very low head r esistance and 5 and
6 for a core of very high head resistance, which would be a very good type for a nose r adiator
and a very b ad type for an ullobstructed position. There are typ es of core considerably better
for unobstruct ed po itions than those included in this te t, while the core represented in plots
5 and 6 is probably one of the bes t for the nose position.
CONCLUSIONS.

B ased on the results of these wind-tunnel experiments on a model fuselage it is concluded
·that:
(1) The r esistance of a fuselage with streamline nose is incr eased more by removing the
s treamline nOse and substituting a radiator than it is by adding an equiv alent unobstructed
radiator and r etaining th e streamline nose.

(2) B etween good radiators for each po ition the increase of resistance due to the LO e
radiator is r oughly double that due to the unobstructed radiator.
(3) Above a very low mass flow the nose radiator becomes r elatively worse and worse,
as the mass flow is incr ea ed by opening the vents at a constant free-air speed. This fact is
of great importance, ince the space available for a nose radiator is so limited that the highest
possible mass flows are used in practice.
(4) It is found that the relative efficiency of the nose radiator and the unobstrueted
radiat.or doe not change appreciably with fr ee-air speed for a given setting of the vents.

EFFECT OF STREAMLINED CASING FOR FREE-AIR RADIATORS.
By S. R. Parsons.

RESUME.

This report on preliminary tests of a radiator inclosed in a streamlined casing shows that
head resistance can be decreased by as much as 50 per cent, but the accompanying decrease
in mass flow of air, and consequently in heat transfer, nullifies the advantage gained, with It
pOs ible exception in the case of very high speeds.
DES RIPTION OF RADIATOR AND CASING.

The radiator used was a 12-inch square section of core, composed of one-fourth inch square
cells, and 3~ inches deep. The casing, which was made of galvanized iron, is illustrated in
figure 1. It is streamlined in one dimension only; the top and bottom pieces being flat rectangular sheets, and the side piece curved. The curves used are not of the common streamline
form, but are arcs of circles, because of the fact that the air flows on both sides of the sheet.
EFFECT OF CASING ON PROPERTIES OF THE RADIATOR.

The casing causes a very considerable reduction in both the head resistance and the mass
flow of air through the core. As the side pieces are brought nearer together and the area of
the mouth reduced, the head resistance first decreases to a minimum, and then increases. The
lowest head resistanc~ found was about 50 pel' cent of that of the uncased core, with a mouth
area equal to one-half of the frontal area of the core. For the only section on which reliable
measurements of mass flow have yet been made,
mass flow through streamlined core _
area of mouth
mass flow through unstreamlined core-area of radiator face

A decrease in mass flow of air causes a decrease in heat transfer, and the advantage of the
reduction in head resistance i outweighed by the disadvantages of the decrease in heat transfer
and the additional weight of the casing. Plot 2 hows the figure of merit resulting from openings of the casing 9 inches, 6 inches, and 3 inches wiele. To how the effect of weight, the figure
of merit has been computed for a casing of galvanized iron, and also for one of aluminum. At
high speeds the effect of weight is mall in comparison with that of head resistance, and the
CUl'ves are not far below the curve for Lhe unstreamlined core, but they will not reach it at
speeds below 100 m. p. h., an 1 probably not at higher speeds. If there is to be any gain in
figure of merit, at the lower speeds, the proportional decrease in headre i tance must be decidedly
greater than the proporLional deCl·ease in mass flow of air. Since, however, the decrease in
heat transfer at high speeds is somewhat less for a given decrease in mass .flow than at low speeds,
it may be that for a speed of 150 m. p. h. ther will be an advantage. The data at present
available do not \'{arrant extrapolation to such a speed.
POSSIBLE AD VA TAGE FOR MA KING.

It seems that if there is to be any considerable advantage in using the streamlined casing
it will be in its adaptability for masking a part of the core. It would be a simple problem in
construction to streamline the water boxes in the vertical dimension and the core in the horizontal, and to place inside of the casing for the water boxes, the mechanism for opening and
closing the mouth of the casing for the core.

RESUME

As an airplane rises to high altitudes the decrease in the dellsity and the temperature of
the air have important effects on the performance of the radiator.
The effect of the lower temperature tends to increase the heat transfer in proportion to
the increase of the llleall temperature difference bet\\-een the Witter in the radiator and the air
tlu'ough which the radiator passes.
The decrease in deusity of the air reduces the mass of air passing through the radiator
for a given plane speed, and thus tends to clecrease the heat transfer by an am unt conesponding
(but not proportlonal) to the decrease in denslty.
Since head resistance is proportional to density of the air, the effect of decrease in density
is to reduce Lhe head re istance hy an amount propol"Lional to the decrease of density.
The combined efrect of density and temperature changes is to decrease the heat transfer,
but head resistance is decrease 1 more rapidly, and for the higher plane speeds the figure of
merit is, in general, increased. On the other hand, at the higher altitudes only half (or even
less) of the cooling capacity may be required.
If the performance of the radiator at Lhe ground is known (from laboratory tests or otherwise), the density of the air and the temperature dlfference between air and water at an altitude may be estimated from data contained in the ourves of plots 1, 2, and 3 and from the
conditions under which the airplane l to be us cd : and with this information at hand the
performance of a radiator at nn altitude mity be estimated for a particular speed of the airplane
at a particular altitude, as follows:
1. To obtain the energy dissipated, first find tl;le mas flo\\' of [lir through the radiator at
the ground and at the desired speed and multiply this value by the ratio of the air dens ity
at the altitude to the density at the ground to obtain the mass flow of air at the altitude.
2. Now, from the results of tests at the ground obtain the energy dissipated per 100 0 F.
temperature difference hetween air and wate;· for the mass flow computed for the al titude,
and multiply this ,'aluc by the estimated telllperature diiTerence at the altitude divided by
100 to obtain the energy actually dissipated at the altitude.
3. For head resistance multiply the value at the ground and at the desi red speed by the
ratio of t,he density at t·lle altitude to the density at the ground.
4. Horsepower absorbed is computed as at the ground by adding to the bead resistance
the qnotient obtained by dividing the weight peT square foot of the radiator filled wi th water
by the lift-drift ratio of the plane and multiplying this sum by the plane speed and the proper
conversion factor .
5. Figure of merit, a at the ground, is the ratio of the energy dissipated to the horsepower
absorbed.
Plots os. 4 to 7 show the effect of altitude on energy dissipated and figure of merit for
two typical radiators, and plot No.8, which shows the ratio of air density at an al t itude to
dens itv at the ground, indicates the proportional decrease of head resistance with increase of
altitude for any type of radiator.

INTRODUCTION.

The efficiency of a radiator for airplane engines depends primarily upon two facton:
(1) Its capacity for dissipating heat and (2) its absorption of engine power because of the nece,-

sity of pushing it through the air (overcoming its head resistance) and of lifting and sustainir.g
its weight.
At high altitudes both the density and the temperature of the air are less than at the
gL'Ound, and the change in these conditions has an importan t effect upon tbe performance of
the radiator. The decrease in air temperature tends to increase tbe cooling capacity, wbile
the decrease in density of the air tends to decrease botb the cooling capacity and tbe absorption of power for any given speed of tbe airplane. On tbe other band, the power of the engine,
and consequently tbe heat to be dissipated, falls off with altitude, so tbat at high altitud s a
given engine may be kept cool by a smaller radiator than that required for the same conditiolls
of speed and climb nem: tbe ground.
PURPOSE.

The purpose of this report is, by showing the effect of temperature and density of tbe air
on dissipation of beat and absorption of power, and with the use of available data on atmospheric conditions at altitudes, to present a method for estimating the performance of a
radiator under altitude conditions in terms of its performance at the ground. A brief discussion will also be given of the relative cooling capacity required at altitudes and at the groun :L
Since atmospheric co nditions are conLinually changing, it will be evident that any e timaGe
of performance at an altitude must be based upon a 'sumed conditions, uch, for example, :1S
mean ummer den ity and temperature of air, in addiLion to a 'umed requirements of operation,
Certain meteorological data have accor,Jsuch as the maximum allowable water temperatur
ingly been included, in order to give uch basis a i available for the assumptions that mu ~ t
be made.
DEFINITIO S OF UNITS.

The results of te ts at the ground are express d a follows:
Free air speed (the speed of the airplane), in mile per hour.
Mass flow of air through the radiator, in pounds per second pel' square foot frontal area.
Energy dissipated (heat transfer), in horsepower pCI' square foot of frontal area per 100° :8'.
difference between the temperature of t}le entering air and the average of the temperatures of
the entering and leaving water, at ground. (At an altitude thi temperature difference mILY
be modified.)
Head resi tance, in pounds per quare foot frontal area.
Horsepower absorbed, in hoI' epower per square foot frontal area, including both that used
in overcoming head resistance and that used in su taining andli.fting the weight of the radiator
and contained water, as uming for the airplane a lift-drift ratio of 5.4.
FiguTe of merit is defined a the ratio of the energy dissipated to the horsepower ab orbed.
BASIS OF THE METHOD.

The method of e timating radiator performance under altitude conditions i ba ed upon
Lhe following laws:
1. Ma s flow of air, for a given peed of the airplane, i proportional to the air den ity.
2. Energy dissipated (rate of heat tran fer), for a given rna s flow of air, is independent
of air den ity. Thi fact is shown by a series of te ts conducted on a number of ,pecimen in a
wind tunnel which was entirely inclosed in a steol tank 0 that the air could be 'partially exhausted. Tho range of air densities used correspond to altitucles up to about 25,000 feot.
P lot o. 10 show the result of these test .1
3. Energy dis ipated for a given rna s flow of air may be regarded a proportional to t:ae
temperature difference indicated under (' Definitions of terms."

EFFECT OF ALTITUDE ON RADIATOR PERFORMANCE.

271

proposed empirical equations for the rate of heat tran fer, in which the temperature difference
occurred to a power slightly different from unity (in some ca es as high as 1.2), but if the greatest
value found were to be used, the difference between the result so obtained and that obtained
u ing unity for the exponent, would be well within the range of uncertainty in atmospheric
conditions at high altitude. For the present purpo e, therefore, the linear proportionality
will be used.
4. Head re i tance, for a given free air speed, i proportional to the density of the air.
Till fact i in general use by aerodynamic engineers, and while it has been verified by a part
of the experimental work on which thi report is based, it hardly requires to be proved here.
In order to give some idea of the a tmo pheric condit;ions that; may be expected at altitudes,
rIots Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are included. These plots are based on data given by W. R. Gregg in
the Monthly Weather Review, January, 191. Plots 1 and 2 indicate mean ummel', winter,
and annual values of temperature and air den ity ba ed upon observations at four stations
situated in Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and California. Plot o. 3 shows the boiling
point of water corresponding to mean annual pres ure at the same station, only one line being
plotted becau e the dillerence between annual and summer or winter means (1.5 0 at 25,000
feet, and less at lower altitude) is so sm.all that it may safely be neglected, in view of the
uncertainties in all altitude conditions.
In order to make use of the data on atmospheric condition, and in particular of the proportionalities mentioned above, it will be convenient to introduce the terms" density factor))
and" temperature factor," and to define them as follows:
. f
air densiLy at altitude
D enShY ac"or=· densIty at ground
.
aIr
j

j

and
T

temperature difference existing at altitude
t
f t
empera ure ac 01'= temperature difference assumed at ground .

It will be noted that den ity and temperature difference" at ground)) denote the assumed
density and temperaLure difference to which the results of tests at ground have been reduced,
and that the' 'factor)) are not constant, but vary with altitude and with atmospheric conditions.
Then the actual value of density and temperature factors to be u ed in any particular
computation will depend upon more or less arbitrary assumption in regard to atmospheric
conditions, and these a umption will depend upon th.e conditions under which it is desired
to study the performance of the radiat r- whether for ummel' 01' winter fiying, whether for
mean or extreme condition, etc. The temperature factor will also depend upon the limit et
for maximum allowable water temperature.
It is now po sible to express the propertie of a radiator at an altitude ill terms of its
properties at the ground, and the density and temperature factors, as follows:
1. For a given freo ait' peed, mas fiow of air, being proportional to air clensity, is equal
to the product of the mass fiow at the ground by the density factor.

2. Assume such conditions as will determine Lhe values of th density and temperature

DESCRIPTION OF CURVES.

Plots Nos. 4 to 7repre ent the properties of two types of radiator core aL aHitude ; plots
Nos. 4 and 6, showing figure of merit, and plots Nos. 5 and 7, energy di sipaLed, in terms of
altitude. The conditions and requirements assumed are mean ummel' density and temperaLure of air and a mean water temperature 30° F. below the boiling point. The computation
are based upon data given in plots Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
Radiator E - is made of flat hollow plates et edg wise to th ail, tream, and its perform!lnce i typical of radiators adapted to u e inunobstrueted po itions- that is, in such positions
on the plane that the flow of air toward or away from the radiator is not ob trueLed by other
parL' of the plane.
Radiator G-3 i a type of high heat transfer and high head resi tance, adapted to u e only
in ob tructed position. It propertie are computed, however, only for the condition of
being placed in an unobstructed position, . ince the problem of determining head resistance in
an ob tructed po ition is too complex to be introduced into thi report. (See Reports No.
59, General Analysis of the Radiator Problem, and 61, Part II, Resi tance Due to No e
Ra.diator.)
The curve indicate that while heat tran fer falls off with altitude, the figure of merit mfLy
increa e slightly at the higher speeds. The gen ral form of the curve is the same for both the
type of core suitable for unob tructed po "itions and the type uitable for obstructed positions.
Plot I o. , based on mean 'ummel' density, show a lypicalrclation of " density factor "
Lo altitude; and since head resisLan e i.. proportionallo densiLy, this plot al 0 shows the relation
of head resi tance at a given fr e ail' 'peed Lo altitude. I 0 cur ve of " temperature factor" is
shown, because so many different assumptions may b made in regard to atmospheric conditions and operating requirements that a single curve could hardly be called typical. "Temperature factor" can easily be computed for variou a umption from data given in the plots of
temperature and boiling point again t altitude.
DEGREE OF MASKING REQUIRED AT ALTITUDES.
1. HORIZONTAL FLIGHT.

If the radiator is to be partly rna ked at the higher altitude, plot I o. 9 may be used Lo
give an approximate idea of the degree of rna king d sil'able, in terms of the cooling capacity
required at the ground for horizontal flight.
L et a radiator be chosen of such a size that it will ju t cool the engine when flying at a given
j ow the energy required
peed (say, 120 miles per hour) horizontally, and close to the ground.
to be dissipated, divided by the energy that the radiator is capable of dissipating, will represent
what may be termed the "effective area" of radiator required at an altitude, in square feet per
square foot required at the ground. The adjective "effective" i used because the decrea e
in heat transfer caused by a partial masking will depend not only upon the area of face covered,
but upon the form of shutter used. The real indication of heat tran fer will be given by the
mass flow of air, rather than by area.
The power of the engine, and eonsequently the heat to be dissipated, may be a umed
roughly proportional to the air density ( ee Report o. 45, Part I ), and an approximate value
may be found by multiplying the energy di sipated at ground by the density factor. Plot
No.9 how the ratio of thi required dissipation to the capacity for di ipation, as taken from
plots os. 5 and 7, and represent approximately the ratio of the "effective area" desirable at
an altitude to that required at the ground, if the radiator i to keep the engine at a con tant
temperature. These curves are plotted for a speed of 120 mile per hour, but are practically
identical with the curves fol' other speeds. This fact, and the small differenee between the
two CUTves plotted, eems to indicate that the de irable degree of rna king is a function of the
altitude, and practically independent of the type of core or of the speed.

II. CHANGE FROl\:[ CLIl\1BING TO HORIZONTAL FLIGHT.

When the plane changes from maximum climb to horizontal flight, its speed will be greatly
increased (for some types of planes, about doubled), and this increase in speed will involve a
proportional increase in mass flow of air, and a corre ponding (though not proportional) increase
in heat transfer. This consideration alone would require a degree of masking that would in
some cases approach 50 per cent of the effectivene s of the radiator at the altitude, but it has
not been included in the computations for plot o. 9 becau e of a wide range of its variation
with different plane and their different uses. If the i:elation is known between the maximum
climbing speed and the horizontal speed when u ing the same engine power, then the mass
flow of air and the corresponding heat transfer can be determined from the results of tests at
the ground, and the degree of masking that i de irable can be found from the two rates of
heat transfer.
It may be well to note that no account has been taken of additional cooling from the
sUl'face of the engine itself or from connecting pipes, caused by the lowering of the air temperature; and again let it be emphasized that mass flow of air gives the real measure of what has
een termed "effective area."

INTRODUCTIO .

The present report is the fourth of a series of reports on airplane radiators, incorporating
the r esults of experimental work at the Burean of Stanctards unrler the joint au pices of that
Bureau , the Aviation Departments of the Army, and the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics. The first three arc the following:
Technical Report No. 43, Synopsis of Aeronautic Radiator Investigations for the years
1917-1918;
Technical Report No. 59, General Analysis of the Airplane Radiator Problem; and
Technical Report I o. 60, General Discu ion of Test Methods for Radiators.
These report contain a discus ion of the technical terms used and briefly defined in the
present report, and a discussion of the methods used in obtaining the data on which the present
report is based.
PURPOSE-

The purpose of this report is to present the results of tests on 56 types of core in a form
convenient for use in the study of the performance of and possible improvements in existing
designs. Working rules are given by which the data contained in the report may be used,
and the most obvious conclusions as to the behavior of cores are summarized.
DEFINITIONS OF TERMS.

(For a complete discussion of the terms and their significance, see tl;1e "Analysis," Technical Report No. 59.)
1. CIIARACTERISTrcS WIIrcII DE CRIBE A TYPE OF CORTh .

These characteristics are given· in Table I, and a few of the most important are included
on each curve sheet.
Metal is designated as brass or copper without attempting to give exact composition.
The thickness is approximate to 0.001 inch.
Dimensions oj core.- Length is measured in the general direction of the water flow; depth,
in the general direction of air flow; and width perpendicular to these two .
Dimensions of water tubes .- Length (in the direction of water flow) is expressed in inches
per foot length of core; depth is measured in the same direction as depth of- core; and width
is the thickness of the stream of water.
Cooling surface is regarded as direct only when backed by flowing water. Indirect surface includes fins, spacers, and surface backed by stagnant water.
Pe?' cent free area is the cross-sectional area of the air tubes in per cent of the frontal areE.
All characteristics are given for a section of core 1 foot square.
II. PROPERTIES TIIAT DE CRIBE TIIE PERFORUANCE OF A

ORE.

The properties of a core are obtained primarily for the purpose of comparing cores. It
must be remembered that the properties of a complete radiator on a plane depend, not only
upon the properties of the core but on the location of the radiator on the plane. This is
especially true of head resistance and the properties involving it. (The method of estimating
the probable performance of a radiator from the properties of its COre is given under "Use of
the data in designing a radiator," below.)

A£ NUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS .

Mass flow of air through the core .is expressed in pounds per econd per square foot of
frontal area. When a core is upported in a free air stream, the flow of air through it is popOl,tiona! to the free air peed (for ordinary type of core).
The mass flow COl1stCLnt is the ratio between the ma flow throuah the core, and the mas
of air flowin a throuah a square foot of area normal to the direction of flow in the undi turbed
air tream. For some purpo e it i more onvenient to u e a "ma flow fnctor" whi hi the
factor by which free air speed in mile per hour must be multiplied to obtain rna s flow.
Energy di sipated or heat tran fer is expressed in hor e power per square foot of frontal
area, for a difference of 100° F. between. the temperature of the air enterin a the radiator :md
the mean of the temperature of the entering anclleaving water.
JIead resistance of the core i the force required to push it through the air, and i exprm eel
in pounds per quare foot of frontal area.
IIead resistance constant i the factor by which the square of the free air speed in miles per
hOUl' must be multiplied to obtain head resi tance in pounds per square foot.
IIorsepower absc~bed i computed by adding to the head re istance the quotient obtained by
dividing the weight of core and contained water (ir pounds per quare foot front) hy the "liftdrift ratio of the airplane, and multiplying the urn hy j'he peed of the plane and by a COlwersion factor.
As the lift-drift ratio varie hetween diITerent planes and varies even more " idely bet\Hen
w
climbing and level flight, it is very important to consider, in the election of a core, the rela~ive
importance of climbing speed and top speed. The value 5.4 is used throughout thi report as
a good average for planes and give equal weight to rate of climb and top peed. If rat J of
climb is of prime importance the value should be as low as 3, while if peed on the level is
the most important a value as high as 10 may be u ed.
Figure of merit is the ratio of the energy dissipated in horsepower to the horsepower
absorbed .
Pressure necessary to produce WQ.ter flow is of importance in determining the maxinlUm
flow possible through a given type of core.
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE CORE OPERATES.

As the properties of a core vary with the conditions under which it is used, it is neces~,ary
to express the results of tests in terms of certain definite condition adopted as standard. rhe
conditions adopted in this work are:
l. 1Vater flow must be high enough to in ure turbulent flow". For mo t type of core this
means that it must be above about 2 gallon per minute per inch of core depth per foot w idth
of core.
2. Tempera~ure difference (between entering air and mean water teml erature) of 100 ) F .
is used in computing the heat tran fer and figure of merit as given.
3. Air densii!/ is taken a 0.0750 pounds per cuhic foot . All re ult gi\ en in thi report
are reduced to the e conditions.
ince one of the mo t important condition affecting radiator performance i the ma
flow of air through the core, the propertie of the cores have been expre sed in terms of rna. s flow.
The effect of variation from the conditions adopted a standard are treated in detail in
separate reports, but are mentioned below in a form for u e in design.
GENERAL FACTS DEDUCED FROM THE RESULTS OF EXPERIME TS.

General tatements deduced from the re ult of the experinlent , together with a few of
the most important conclusion from other reporLs, are as follows:
HEAT TRAN" FER.

l. Heat tran fer is a function of mas flow of ail', independent of den ity. (ee Technical
Report Jo . 62.)
2. Heat transfer is roughly proportional to mass flow for a core having only direct co,)Zing
surface. When there is a consid crable amount of indirect cooling surface the heat transfer
increases less rapidly than roa s flow at high air speeds.

3. Heat transfer is proportional to the temperatu1'e difference menLioned above .
4. Heat transfer i not o-l"eatly affected by the ?'ate of water flow provided the rate is above
2 gallons per minute per inch of core depth per foot width of core. It should be noted) however, that thi i true only when the mean water temperature i regarded a con tanto (See
below)" e of data in the de ign of radiator: Rate of water flow.")
5. Heat tran fer from direct cooling surface is not appreciably a:ITected by the comZJosition
of the metal. When fins and other indirect cooling surface are used the thermal conductivity
of the metal i important.
6. Heat tran fer is somewhat increased) but at the expense of a large increase in head
re i tance, by spirals or other form of pa ages which inrl'ea e the turbulence of the air tream.
Heat transfer i greater for mooth than for rough tube wall) fer) if the surface is rough, it will
be covered with a layer of more or less tagnant fluid.
IIEAD RESISTANCE.

1. Head resistance for any partieular core varie approximately as the square of the free·
airspeed. In mo t ca es the exponent i lightly 10 s than 2. RadiaLor E-4 i an exception
to thi rule. Till radiator exhibits re onance effect which cause it to whistle in an air stream
having a velocity of more than about 30 mile per hour) and cause head resistan 0 curve to
show irregularities in the reO"ion whore whistling tarts .
2. The head 1'e i tance of a core appoars to be clo ely related to its mass flow constant so
that, in general) anything which tend to cut down the flow of air Lhrough the core will cause a
con iderable increa e in head re i tance. (eo plot 1.)
3. Head resistance vari s directly a the ai1' density for a given free air peed, and inver ely
a the density for a given mass Dow. (See Techl1ical Report No. 62.)
4. Head re i tance is considerably increased by projections, ind nLat.ions) or holes in the air
tube walls.
5. Head re istance per square foot i not appreciably affected by the size of the C01'e within
the limits u ed) viz) by 8 inches to 16 by 16 inches and 12 by 24 inches. (See Technical Report
No. 61) Part 1.)
1\:[ASS FLOW OF AIR.

Mass flow of all' IS directly proportional to free air speed for mo t types of core . The
cores E-4 and G-4 are exceptions.
USE OF THE DATA IN THE DESIGN OF A RADIATOR.
CHOICE OF A POSITION.

The first step in the de ign of a radiator i the choice of a po ition on the airplane. The
po ible positions may be divided into two cla e :
1. nob tructed positions, i. e., tho e in which the flow of air through and around the
radiator is not obstructed by other portions of the plane.
2. Obstructed po itions) such a the no e of the fu elage) a po ition within the fuselage) and
in the plane of the wing.
It has been hown in Teclmical Report Jo. 61, and also in reports of work done both in
Great Britain and in France, that an obstructed position involves a very large absorption of
power) so that from the viewpoint of power absorbed for a given heat transfer, the unobstructed
po ition is far preferable to the obstructed. Tests on a model have shown that the resistance of
a fuselage fitted with a no e radiator is from two to three times the re i tance of the same fuselage
with a stream-line nose) and that the increase in resistance due to the ub titution of a radiator
for the stream-line no e is greater than the increase that would be caused by using a radiator of
the same core construction and the same cooling capacity in an unobstructed po ition.
ELECTION OF A TYPE OF CORE.

In an unobstructed position the head re istance and consequently al 0 the figure of merit of
the core will be closely related to these properties of the complete mdiator. so that in thi ca e the

core must have a high figure of merit. aL the free air peed at which it i used. The most compact
construction con, i tent with thi fundamental requirement i de irable. In order to obthin a
high figure of m rit the core should ha"e smooth, traight air passages, easy entrance and 3xit.s
for the air, and a large per cent free arett. With tlw e factors carefully aUended to Lh figure of
merit of eore increa e wit.h depth up t.o 20 times the diameter of the air t.ube , "hich i a
far as experiments have been made. Eyen greater depth may be of ad,antage in obta:ning
compactne .
Byfar the mo t ati factory radiator for u e in unobstructed position seems to be one of t.hin
fiat plates, not over -h inch thick, and paced ~ inch on c nt. r . The plat.e ,'hould be at lea t
12 inches in depth. The chief defect. of this type of construction i' mechanical wenJmess. (ee
cores E-6, E-7, and E- .)
Of radiator now in commercial u '0 in this country that ha,e been te ted, TOS. A-23,
A-13, A-20 A-19, and A-7 are best suited to usc in unobstructed pOl'ition , but the? are
decidedly inferior to the flat plate type at high air peed.
For u e in obstructed position ' t.he selection of a core is moro difIi cult , but in general high
heat transfer at low air pe d is de, irahle. Indirect cooling surLl('e may be of ad,antaO'(: if it
i made of copper, crimped from the water tube walls, and \\",,11 ,'oldered t.o them at all ponsible
places.
Among the core te ted, I 0 . A-7, A-:?O, G-3, A-2, G-4, and B- are be t suite:l for
ob tructed po ition. It should be noted t.hat for u e in tho wing, a high head resi tance of
the core is not a disadvantage, and it is pos ihle that a rore uch as F-4, which ha considerable
mechanical strength and a low wat.er resistance, might be u cd.
With this pos ible exception, the fin and t.ube type i un uited for use in any po iLion, it.
high head re istance and small amount of direct cooling surface making it efficiency very low.
SlZE OF CORE.

Having selected a type of core for th de ired location, the computation of size required i
relatively imple. In the ca e of a radiator for an unob tructed po ition, the heat transfer can
be determined directly from the cUr\T if tbe de 'ired be t climhing peed of the plane and the air
es
temperature arc known. The effect of propeller lip mu t be estimated and allowed for. The
energy to be di ipated should be deternun d if po ' ible in an} partieular ase, but i mually
about equal to the brake horsepower of the engine. Thell the rat.io of the energy . 0 be
di sipated to the energy di ipated per srp.lare foot frontal arM of core will gi,e the fronta:. area
required. From the weight and headresi t.anee the eITcct of t.he radialor on the a rodyna,mical
properties of the plane can be determined.
In the ca e of a radiator placed in the no e of the fu clag , until better data are available,
the rna flow of air in pounds per econd per square foot may be con idered numerically a
between 0.04 and 0.07 times the peed of the plane in miles pel' hou!', depending on the amonnt of
cowling and the rna king effect of the propeller. From thi the rna' flow can be est.imated, and
the en rgy di ipated per quare foot frontal 0.1' 'a is deternunrd from the plot, u ing t.he rna s
flow scale.
The rna s flow for a wing racliator depend upon the angle of incidence, but is probah.y not
over 0.01 time the plane peed in M. P. 11., e,en at the best climbinO' angle. The tubes are in this
case presented to the air at an angle which probably incr a e tho hCllt transfer considerably.
POWER ABSORBED .

Power absol'bed can be computed readily only in the case of a radiator in an unobstructed
posltlOn . The actual force on the radiator core when in an obstructed po ition may be computed from the curves of head resi tance again t mas flo v, but the uncertain effect (.n the
properties of the fu elage i of far greater importance. For obstructed racliator , the ·)ower
absorbed as computed represents only the minimum possible absorption.

RATE OF WATER FLOW.

Although the energy dis~ipated as given in the curves is practically constant for rates of
water flo .v abo\'"e about 2 gallons per minute per fo ot width per inch depth of core, the allowable mean temperature incr eases li ~htl y with incre ased water velocity, since it is the temperature of the entering water that must be kept I1t a certain point helo N ~oilin6; With a flow
of ~ gallon per minuLe per horsepo ,'"e]' dissipated a temperature differenc e of about 20° F.
is obtained, or the mean \n1trr tpmper,1ture in the radiator is 10° F. helow the entering water
temperature. If the flow is increased to Y2 gall on per minute the temperature di:ITerence will
he 10° and the mean temperature may be 5 ° higher than before. .\ further increase in water
flow could not give more than 5° further increase and would probably be at the cost of an
exce siye loss of po .,"rr in the pump. A flo N of Y2 gallon per minute per horsrpo ,'1er dissipated
may be r egarded as desirable, while with radiators that are relati\'"cly long and narrow a decrease
of flo',v to 7.! gallon per minute per hoI' epo,Yer dissipated may be necessary.
PRESSURE NECESSARY TO PRODUCE WATER FLOW.

The pressure whieh is available to produce the water fl ow is usually the difference between
the vapor pressure of the '\H1ter leaving thc radiator and l.1.tmospheric pressure. As this pressure
diITerence may be only ahout 5 pounds per square inch, the resistance of the core to water flow
mn,y limit the po sible (low l:;eriously ullie-ss caro is takC'n to make the co re I1S \'ide as possible.
The \\"ater resistan 'e of ,,1, core seems to depend largely on the care used in manufacture
and on the form of the water tube entrances 3Jld exits . In the light of tests made, it seems that
it \'~ould be well to include <L t('st for pres. ure necessary to produce water flow in acceptance
specifications for complete radiators, n. slight yariation in manufacture affect water resistance
greatly. In Part II of this report are given the results of some tests on water resistance.
DESCRIPTION OF TABLES AND CURVES.

In order to indicate the degrre of reliahility of the results shown, actual observations are
indicated on the plots by circ1rcl poin ts, and at the end of this report is a brief statement showing
the means used in obtaining results for the cases where" observed" points are not shown .
Table I contains the characteristics of cores as noted above and sketches showincr the form
of au' and water passages. This table includes certain special types of core on which complete
tests have not been made and which are accordingly not included in tlus report. The special
proper tie of uch cures will be made the subjects of separate reports.
Tahle II lists the prop('rties of the cores at mass fio,,"s of au' of 2, 4, 6, and 8 pounds per
square foot per second, in order to allo'w really comparison between them . It also includes
the heat transfer in B. t. u. per minute per square foot of frontal area of or, and in hors power and in B. t. u. per minute per square foot of cooling surface.
Table III lists the same properties as 'Table II at free air speeds of 30, 60, 90, and 120
miles per hour. In addition, it gives the mass flow (at" stanclard " density) corresponding to
these free air speeds, and a "grade" for the radiator, grade A denoting very good performance
and grade E very poor performance, among the cores tested. Thi table is directly applicable
only to radiator. in mioh tructed po iti ons.
Table IV gi\'"es constants of empirical equations for heat transfer, hrad r esistance, and
mass flow, for cores in unobstruct~d positions.
Plot 1 is an ~1pproximate empirical r elation bet'ween the proportionality factors for head
resistance and mass flow.
The remaining plots sho'\\' the propertirs of the cores in terms of mass flow of air, with the
corresponding fre e air speeds (for unobstru cted positions) indicated by a scale added at the
top of the sheet. For the core E- -!, the mass flow is not a linear function of the free air
speed, and a separate plot sho',vs the properties in terms of free air speed. For the core 8-4,
the relation of ma s flo ,v to free ttir speed is linear above 15 miles per hour, but not below that
speed, which hct accounts for what would appear to be an error in marking the free air speed
scale of plot 58.

ANNUAL REPORT :NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

NOTE ON SOURCES OF DATA.

Becau e of the undesirability of removing the headers from all pcdmens so that head
resistance could be mea ured directly, and because certain mechanically weak specimens becam
damaged before complete te ts had been made, a part of the data wa obtained not from direct
measurement but by the methods described belo,v.
Mass flow of air wa measured in term of free air spee(l on all pe 'imen except E-7, and in
this case wa e timated by interpolation bet ,-een the value for E - 6 amI E- _
Heat tmn ~fe1' wa measured in term of mas. flo v of air on all type except the following :
E-4, e timated by interpolaLion bet\\' een the v!tlues for two imilar types of the same
depth, but different spacings.
E-6, E-7, deLermined by correction from preliminary to t made before the apparatus
was put in final form.
F-5, estimated from results obtained on a imilar type of lightly different depth .
Head 1'e istance WttS measured directly n half of the ore included in thi report, and on a
number of other not included, and Lhe proportionality factor for headre istance wa plotted
against that for mass flo,,-, in the ca e of about 40 type having mooth straight ail' pa sag s.
The resulting poinLs fell very near a single line, which i shown in plot 1, and this plot wa u ed
to determine head resi tance from a mea ured mass flow factor for other types with mooth
traight air pa a'1' . Value thu obtained are probably good ,,'ithin about 5 per cent.
The core A-19 to A- 22 andG- 2 could not be treated in this way because points for imilar
types did not lie on the curve of plot 1, and in the e ca es the headresi tance wa e timated
by comparison with other similar types and with the plot.
Head re istance of type 0-2b wa deLermined by interpolation 'lith respect to ma flow
between values for
2 and 0-2a.
Head resistance of types E-6, 7, and was determined from the re ults of a fairly comprehensive set of tests on the head resistance of flat plate radiators of variou dE'pths and spacings.

WATER FLOW THROUGH RADIATOR CORES.]
By W. S.

JAMES.

PURPOSE OF TESTS.

The tests were made to deLermine the pressure neces~ary to produce waLeI' nows up to 50
gallons pel' minute through an -inch square section of radiator core.
RADIATOR CORES TESTED.

The radiator cores tested were made up by the manmacturel's in approximately 8-inch
square sections and fitted with rectangular water boxe ,a hown in figure ] to 12. 'l'he make'S
n.nd core depth of the sections tested were as follows:
(1) Ajax Auto and Aero Sheet Metal Co., 34-inch quare tubes, 4 inches deep.
(2) G. & O. Manufacturing Co., 34-inch rhombic tubes, 3% inches deep.
(3) The Harrison Radiator Corporation, -h-inch hexagonal tubp , 4 inches deep.
(4) The Livingston Radiator & Manufacturing Co., 34 -inch square tubes, 4 incheS deep.
(5) '1'he Living ton Radiator & Manufacturing Co. , -h-inch squai'e tubes, 4 inches deop.
(6) The Rome-Turney Radiator Co ., 34-inch square tube , 3% inche deep.
(7) The McCord Manufacturing Co., -h-inch ell1ptical tubes, 3Y2 inche deep.
( ) The McCord Manufacturing Co. , :fin and tube, 3 % inches deep.
(9) The 1Iodine Manufacturing Co. , ( pirex core) ii-inch square tube with spirals, 3 Yz
inches deep.
(10) The Spark -Withington Co., %-inch eUiptical tube, 3Yz ulches deep.
(11 ) 'r he Hooven Sales Corporation, ( pery core) %-inoh elliptioal tube, 2% inches deep .
(12) The Western Mechanical Works, ( taggered core) -h-inch staggered square tube,
4 inche deep.
METHOD OF TEST.

The radiator section were connected in tlie discharge line of a centrifugal pump and in
eric ·w ith a Venturi meter. The di charge from the radiator wa connected to the inlet of
the pump . A re el've water tank in which a constant head of ·water was automati ally maintained wa connected to the suction line of the pump to provide a water reserve and to act a a
surge tank. The centrifugal pump was driven by a belt from a dU'ect current shunt motor.
The rate of water flow wa measured by a Venturi meter with a ] -inch diameter inlet and
a Yz-inch diameter throat. The Venturi pre sure difference wa ob erved on a mercury gauge.
The constant of the Venturi tube and gauge was determined by .careful calihration. A constant pressure water supply from a pre sure regulating valve \ya used as a ource of water and
the discharge was measured by means of a large weighing tank of about 100 cubic feet capacity.
The pres ure drop in the water was measured by means of piezometer connections soldered
on the radiator water hoxe. These piezometer connections were made by soldering square
copper tub es to the outside of the water boxes, then drilling from the outside one millimeter
holes, spaced one inch apart, through both walls of the quare copper tube and the water box top.
Holes \yere then bored in the water box ends and a scrapulg tool inserted in the water
box to scrape off the burr on t.he holes ulside the wator boxes. A V- shaped strip of galvanized
u'on was then ulserted Ul the water box to protect the holes from the effect of the impact of
the high velocity water str ams impinging on the piezometer tube holes. The holes in the

METHOD OF WORKING UP RESULTS.

Tho Yl1luo of tho raL of flow were computed in gallons per minu to for each of Lho Yentl1l'i
gauge roading at oach rate of flow and the mean of the 0 si..-x: reading iaken a Lho mean
rate of Dow. The values of the pre ure drop in the water woro then computed from tho SL'C
pre uro drop gauge readinO's and Lhe mean of these SL'C readings ,"a takon a the pre ure
drop corrosponding to the mea ured rate of flow.
In this manner five point were obtained on the rate of .flow-pres ure drop cune for each
radiator. The 10gariLhm of tho rato of Dow wore then plottod again t the logarithms of Lho
pressure drops and tho obseryed points "yere found to lie on a traight line. Thon as it was found
that it was impossible to obtain greater £low than 25 gallons pOI' minute with the set-up without
bulging tho \vater boxe of the radiators, the traight lines on the logarithmic plots were continued on to 50 gallons per minute. The anti-logarithms of the pre ure drop were then found
for points on tho logarithmic curve corresponding to 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 55 gallon per minute.
Plots 14 to 25 were thon made by u ing the obseryod \~alues of Lhe pressuro drop from 0 io 25
gallons pOI' minute and the extrapolated yalue of the pres ure drop' from 25 to 55 gallons per

METHOD DEVISED FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE RESULTS OF THE ACCOMPANYING TESTS ON
THE PRESSURE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN WATER FLOW THROUGH RADIATOR CORES.

The following method of approximating the l)ressures necessary to maintain water flows
through radiator cores has been dev-ised in order to make immediate use of the data given in
this report in estimating the order of magnitude of the pressure necessary to maintain water
flows through radiator cores of dimensions (i. e., core lengths, widths, and depths) differing
from those used in the experiments described.
Extreme accuracy can not be expected of the approximation giv-cn, the error being between
10 and 20 per cent. The terms width, length, and depth of the core as used in this roport are
<1efmed as follows:
Core width is the linear dimension of the core, perpendicular to both the dir'ection of watrl'
flow and the du'ection of air flow.
Core length is the linear dimension of the core, parallel to the direction of water flow.
Core depth is the linear dimen ion of the coro, parallel to the diJ:l'ction of au' flow.
METHOD OF USING PLOTS.

The method used is based upon the pressure necessary to maintain a given rate of flow
Lhe rough single water tubes 1 foot long and of varying depths of core (i. e., 3 inches, 3.5 inches,
4 inches, 4.5 inches, 5 inches, and 5.5 inches).
1£ all the water tubes in the radiator core carry equal amounts of water, the amount of water
carried by each tube of any radiator section can be computed provided the following data are
known: (1) The volume of water to be forced through the total width of core per minute, (2)
the total width of radiator core the and (3) the number of water tubes per foot of width. The
first two factors (1) and (2) are dependent on the design of the radiator in question, the latter
. (3) is given on plots 26 to 37 for the cores tested.
When the amount of water to be carried by each tube has been determined the pressure
necessary to maintain the required rate of flow can be read from the plots which gives the
pressures necessary to maintain various rates of flow through a single water tube 1 foot in
length of the make of radiator core inclicated. On these plots curves are drawn for even one-half
inch depths of core from 3 to 5.5 inches. The pressure corresponding to the flow desu:ed may
be read from the curve Ior the core depth to be used or fmmd by estimation between tho curves
for the core depths given:
The pressure found from the plot is then multiplied by the length of the radiator core in
the direction of water flow. The product of the pressure necessary to maintain the desired
flow through 1 foot length of radiator cOl~e multiplied by the core length will give the
approximate value of the pressure required to maintain the desired rate of water 1low.
For example: It is desired to find the pressure necessary to maintain a water flow of 100
gallons per minute through a II Spery" radiator Gore '32 inches long, 16 inches wide, and 4 inches
deep.
As there are 30 water tubes per foot width of core, there are 40 tubes per 16 inches of
width.
The rate of flow through each tube will therefore be

~ooo =

2.5 gallons per tube per minute.

From the plot, a pressure of 10.7 feet of water per foot of tube length is required to maintain a flow of 2.5 gallons per minute per tQbe.
As the tube length is 2.5 feet, a pressure of 2 ..5 X 10.7 = 27 feet of water will be required Lo
maintain a flow of 100 gallons of water per minute through the "Spery" core 16 inches wide
and 32 inches long.
METHOD OF CONSTRUCTING PLOTS.

The following method was adopted in constructing the plots of the pressures necessary to
produce given rates of water flow through single tube 1 foot long with varying depths.
Values of the pressure necessary to maintain rates of flow of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 gallons
per minute through an 8-inch width of core were TOt1.d from the plot for each type of radiator

AUTICS.

te ted. These values of the pressure necessary for an 8-inch core were multiplied by 1 .5 to
reduce them to the value for a core length of 1 foot. The various raLes of flow (i. e., 10, 20,
30, 40, and 50 gallons per minute) were then divided by the number of tubes and the corresponding values of the flow in gallons per tube found.
The Chezy formula for water flow was then assumed in the form given below (1) and the
effect on the value of 6P of changing core depths found for the rates of flow indicated above
. as follows:
v = Linear water velocity.
6P = Pressure necessary to maintain velociLy TT.
R = Hyiliaulic radius of water tube.
Area of water tube
= Perimeter of water tube.
A = Area of water tube.
Q = Rate of water flow.
t = Water tube thickness.
d= Water tube depth.

Equation (2) provides a means of evaluating 6P for a core 3 inches, 3.5 inches, 4 inch s
(etc.) deep when the value of 6P for a core" d" inches deep" t" inches thick and the exponent
"n" are ImoWll.
Whim the values of 6P for various core depths are found in the manner indicated above
and are read directly from the curve plotted, the following assumptions ba\T been tacitly
e
made:
(1) That the same quantity of water pa ses thl'ough each water tube in the core.
(2) That the pressure maintaining flow varies directly as the length of the water tube
parallel to the direction of water flow, and that the entrance and exit losses are neglected.
(3) That the pressure necessary to produce flow varies inver ely as the hyiliaulic radius
and directly as the" nth" power of the linear water velocity. The values of "n" being found
by experiment when the hydraulic radius remains constant.
(4) That the water tube thickness remains constant for any given core and has the value
given, when the depth of the core and the length of the waLeI' path change.

REPORT No. 64.
EXPERIMENTAL RESEAR CH ON AIR PROPELLER S, Ill.
By W. F.

D URA, D

and E. P .

LESLEY.

SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION COVERED BY PRE.SENT TESTS.

The investigation described in this report was conducted for the National Advi ory Committee for Aeronautics at Leland Stanford Junior University, Palo Alto , Calif.
The investigation on air propellers carried on during the two ·years 1917- 18 and forming
the subj ect of reports Nos. 14 and 30 1 of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
covered the following general characteristics of form and design :
Four nominal pitch ratios, viz, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.1.
Two forms of blade contour, (1) with approxima tely parallel ides and lightly rounded
tip and (2) curved and tap ering in accordance with the common sab er form.
Two m ean width r a tios, viz, 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the r adius of the propeller.
Two forms on the driving face, viz, plane and camb er ed or hollowed.
Two forms of dis tribution of geometrical pitch , (1) uniform and (2) i.ncr easing r adia.lly
as determined by the assignment of a constant theoretical angle of attack.
I n the study of the hollowed or camb er ed driving face, all combinations of characteris tics
otherwise with a degree of camber m easured by one-third the thiclmess of the corresponding
straight-face section were t est ed, while six with a degree of camb er one-half the preceding
were tried.
In the s tudy of propellers with radially increasing pitch, this feature had n ot b een extended
to those of nominal pitch r atio 1.1.
In addition to propellers with combinations of characteristics as indicated above, a
considerable numb er of tests wer e cani ed out, as r ecorded in r ep ort No. 3 0, covering a variety
of forms of blade contour combined wi th one or more combinations of other ch ar ac teristics.
In continu ation of this gen eral program of inves tigation, it seem ed de irable to examine
in particular the influence of the following characteristics:
(1) Nominal pitch. ratio 1. 3 cOPlbined with a certain numb er of the mor e comm on or
standard forms and prop ortions.
(2 ) Driving face slightl y rounded or convex.
(3) Change in the location of the maximum thickness ordinate of the blade section .
(4) Pushing forward the leading edge of the blad e, thu giving a rounded convex surface
on the leading side of the driving face.
(5) A series of v al ues for the cons tant " angle of attack " in forming propellers with radially
incr easing pitch.
In . accordance with these purposes t es ts have been carri ed ou t on orn e 28 propellers,
figure 1, having characteristi cs as follows
Four propellers of nominal pitch ratio 1. 3, uniform pitch , s trai ght f ace, and with four
combinations of form of blade and area as shown in T able I.
Five propellers of nominal pitch ratios 0.5 , 0.7, 0.9, 1.1 , and 1.3, all of uniform pi tch, on e
area and one blade form , and with the driving face made slightly convex by adding ·a cro,Vll of
one-sixth the norDlal thickness of the carre ponding straight-face sections, a shown in Table I
and in sections, figur e 2.

and the latter are the pitches of the driving face at the 4 and 18 inch radii, respectively. These
propellers were given a radially increasing pitch according to the Drzewiecki method. For all
blades showing the same value of nominal pitch ratio the pitch of the driving face at the 13-inch
radius equals the diameter multiplied by the value of pitch ratio given. The following table
shows the assumed constant " angle of attack " which gives rise to the variation in nominal

The contour, area, and section of propellers 127 to 13 are the same as for 3, 7, 11, 15, 19,
and 23 of the 1917 report; 2 of the 1918 report; and 113 of the present investigation. The
20 may then be arranged in the following five series: .

The first of each series ha a uniform pitch; the second has a radially expanding pitch
produced by the assumption of a 3° "angle of attack"; the thu'd one for a 6° " angle of attack";
the fourth one for a 9° "angle of attack."
All propellers in one series have the same geometrical pitch at the 13-inch radius . It
should be noted that the effect of an assumed constant " angle of attack" varies inversely
with the nominal pitch ratio. For instance, with propeller No. 127 (6°, 0.5 pitch ratio) the
pitch changes from 12.32 to 21.29 inches, a variation of about 43 per cent of the maximum,
while for propeller 137 (6 °, 1.3 pitch ratio) the change is from 45.52 to 49.60 inches, a variation
of less than 9 per cent of the maxUnum.
CONSTRUCTIO

OF MODELS.

The model propellers were carved from single ticks of well- ea oned Pa ·i.fic coast sugar
pine (Pinus Lambe1,tiana) in the manner previously described. A departure was made from
previous practice in the method of finish. After carving and sandpapering, the smooth bare
wood was given one coat of orange shellac. This was rubbed with fine sandpaper and the
surface given three to four coats of fiat gray paint, put on very thin with a camel's-hau' brush.
Each coat wa thoroughly dried and rubbed smooth small surface defects being corrected with
a filler. The propellers were then given two coats of rubbing varnish , the first being rubbed
to surface with pumice and water and the second left glossy. The resultant finish is smooth,
thin, and hard. For photographing, a single coat of fiat gray was applied after tests were
completed.
AERODYNAMIC LABORATORY.

T ests on the present series of model propellers were conducted in the aerodynamic laboratory at Stanford University, California, during the month of September, 1919. The wind
tunnel is of sUnilar form and proportions to that previously described,! but considerably larger,

having a throat diameter of 7.5 feet. It is of somewhat more substantial construction, being
solidly framed, and planked with ~-inch thick tongue-and-groove flooring.
The wind fan is 15 feet diameter, with eight blades of 12-foot pitch. It is driven by a
100-horsepower, 220-volt, variable-speed, direct-current motor, with which, at 25 per cent
overload, a wind velocity of 80 miles per hour may be realized.
TESTS.

The tests were conducted in a similar manner to those described in the 191 annual report.
omewhat greater wind velocities were used, it being the practice to start the test' with a wind
velocity of about 45 miles per hour. After the safe limit of thrust (about 50 pounds) or the
power limit of the driving motor (12 horsepower) was reached with this velocity, observations
were made at higher slips by reducing the wind velocity until the u eful range of slip had been
covered.
The thrust-torque dynamometer and other devices used in 1917 and Hll were employed
in these present tests. The .thrust balance, torque springs, and wind-speed meter were suhjecteJ to frequent careful calibrations as previously.

marked. I n some cases it is in one direction and in some in the other. This is accounted for
by the fact that with the larger pitch ratios the variation of pitch is less than with the smaller
pitch ratios for the same" angles of attack."

EFFICIENOY I

RELATION TO PITCH RATIO.

The 1.3 pitch ratio propellers show a larger range of efficiency and a lightly higher maximum than imilar form tested in 191 (1.1 pitch ratio ). There is a marked decrease in efficiency at the higher lips, some blades showing an efficien y CUTve which i lightly concave

o. 11, 7, 3, 2, and 113 (straight face). Although the thru t developed is
Ie for the form er , the power ab orbed i proportionally Ie , 0 that the efficiency is little
affected. Having slightly less dynamic pitch, a lightly Ie s maximum efficiency for the roun edface serie i to be expected. It appears, howe,er, that the strength of blades may be con iderably increased by lightly rounding the face, and with little or no corresponding loss in effiClency.
(b) Position of maximum ordinate.-Cross CUT,es of efficiency for propellers 120, 121, 7
of 1917, 122, and 123 show highe t efficiency for 0.7, whose maximum ordinate of section is
one-third of the width from the leading edge.
o. 121 appears superior to o. 120. There is
little difference between Nos. 122 and 123, but both are distinctly less efficient than o. 7.
(c) L eading one-third offace rounded by pushing leading edgefo'rWard.-Pushing the leading
edge forward increases the maximum efficiency attained but decreases the efficiency over the
working range. The increase in maximum efficiency is not more than would be expected from
the increase~in[dynamic pitch .

FOREWORD.

This publication is one of a series of eight monographs prepared by the Forest Products
Laboratory of the Forest ervice, United tates Department of Agriculture, for pUblication
by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.
The purpose of the series of monographs is to discuss in detail the various requirements of
wood for use in aircraft, and al 0 to make public some of the results obtained in the experimental
and testing work of the Forest Products Laboratory undertaken for the Army and Navy
during the war.
The subjects discussed in the series will include: (1) Kiln drying of airplane woods, (2)
the effect of kiln drying on strength, (3) the care of airplane stock, (4) the composition and use of
gh:es, (5) the manufacture and testing of ply wood, (6) wood in airplane construction, (7)
moisture-resistant finishes, and ( ) wood airplane parts.

REPORT No. 65.
THE KILN DRYING OF WOODS FOR AIRPLANES.
By nARRY D.

TIEMANN.

I. INTRODUCTION.
KILN DRYING UNDER WAR CONDITIONS.

The exigencies of the war and the scarcity of air-dried material necessitated the kiln drying,
immediately from the green condition, of practically all 'Of the wood used in the nited States
for airplanes. This was a complete reversal of established practice and, from the standpoint
of commonly accepted beliefs, was a dangerous innovation. England and France specified
again t "kiln clryinO''' airplane woods, but in certain instances permitted" conditioning," that
i , allowing the lumber to remain in a slightly heated dry room, usually at 25° C. (77° F.) or
30 ° C. ( 6° F.). A higher moisture content, however, was allowed there than in this country,
.the British requirement being 15 per cent for most woods and 1 per cent for ash, with an
allowable variation of 3 per cent.
Perhaps the term" kiln drying" has an unfortunate association with lime or pottery or brick
kilns, in which the material is baked. It must be admitted that the results formerly obtained in
kiln drying lumber tended to create a prejudice in favor of the time-honored methods of slow
air seasoning. The application of artificial heat, in the absence of thorough scientific knowledge
of the principles involved and the development of a correct technique, resulted in much injury to
the wood in checking, loss of strength, and warping.
Within the last 10 years the United tates has taken the lead in placing the ubject on a
technical and scientific basi. It is now a well-established fact that many pecies of wood can be
dried from the green state with better results than can be obtained by the irregular and unscientific method of air drying. While the chief reason for kiln drying in the past has been a saving
of time, as the methods are perfected the superiority of the results obtained, from a quality
tandpoint, will be an increa ingly important consideration.
Ordinary air seasoning, on account of its vicissitudes due to inability to control the process, is
far from an ideal method of conclitioning, evcn though the element of time did not enter into the
question. This is particularly true for the more r efractory and the more valuable woods and
for all woods which are required for very exacting purposes, such as airplanes. It should not be overlooked, however, that a very gradual seasoning at air temperature, provided conditions
arc properly controlled, can not be excelled in its efl'ect upon quality. This is true for the r eason
that the moi ture difference between the outer surface and the interior is thereby kept at a
minimum, so that no appreeiable stresses arc brought abou t by unequal sm.'inkages.
Because of the shortcomings of air seasoning various auxiliary methods have b en sometimes
u cd, such as preliminary soaking for years in ponds of water (still practiced in parts of Japan
and weden) or burying in the ground or in manure.
Although the popular prejudice against kiln drying has not been entirely removed, especially
in European countries, this method of conditioning lumber is now a scientific art and not a
haphazard guess . Exhaustive strength tests made recently by the Forest Products Laboratory
have shown beyond question that properly kiln-dried wood is just as strong, tough, and stiff as
the best air-dried material.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIO

AL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Kiln drying for special purposes, such as airplanes, should be looked upon as a highly technical art. Lumber can be much more easily injured in a dry kiln than if left to dry in a shed
exposed to the air, and unless the kiln drying is properly conduct d air drying is safer. But
if the kiln is in charge of a techincal expert, and the process is carried oIl. in a scientific manner,
kIln drying is greatly to be preferred to ordinary air drying.
The exigencies brought about by the war left no choice but to u e kiln-dried material. To
air dry Dougla fir \ving beams requires ordinarily from 12 to 18 months. They may be kiln
dried in 18 to 24 days. To air dry hardwood propeller stock takes at least one and preferably
two years. The same material can be kiln dried and brought to equally good condition in a
month's time. Air drying was, under the circumstances, wholly out Cif the question.
QUALITIES OF PROPERLY DRIED WOOD.

Whether kiln dried or air dried, the success of the sea oning process depends upon the
extent to which the following requirement are met.
uch checks are not necessarily
The material should be free from surface and end checks.
visible. They may develop in the drying process and close up again when it is completed.
, This does not rectify the injury; the ,checks are still present, though pressed tightly together.
Such material is unsuitable for airplanes.
The wood must be entirely free from internal checks, or" honeycombing" ( ee PI. II). uch
checks may be invisible upon the surface, but are evident when the stick is cut into.
The wood must be free from " casehardening ." Casehardening is due to internal stresses.
It is discussed in detail on page 19. Casehardened wood warps and cups when res awed or cut
into small pieces (see PI. III) .
orne times the internal stresses may be only temporary, due
to unequal moisture distribution, and disappear when the moisture equalizes. In that case they
are not serious, provided res awing does not take place in the meantime. Or they may remain
in the wood indefinitely. Such stresses are of course detrimental.
The moisture must be uniformly distributed. In poorly dried lumber, portions of it may
still retain some free water while other portions are very dry. Or there may be a wet core in
the center while the outside is dry (see Plate IV, fig . 1.) Both condition are extremely bad,
as it will require an excessively long period before the moisture will equalize, and in the equalizing process the wood is subj ect to all the dangers which it faced in the original drying. Wood
should never be manufactured into fini hed parts while the moisture distribution is unequal,
ince the relative dimensions are certain to change when the moi ture finally equalizes, so the
parts will no longer correspond in size.
The strength and toughness of the wood must be at a maximum. High temperatures and
excessive internal stresses during drying cause injury to the strength and toughness. The
effects vary considerably with different species. Softwoods as a rule are Ie s subject to injury
of this kind than are hardwoods. Exces ive drying may of itself cause brittleness, even though
the wood has subsequently reabsorbed moistme. For this reason the drying must not be carried
too far. The requirements for airplanes are so exacting that material which would be entirely
satisfactory for commercial uses might be altogether unsuitable for airplane. Visual inspection of the dried wood i inadequate, ince injury to strength may occur without any defect
visible to the eye. IIence the dryinO' proce s it elf must be closely watched and controlled.
The wood should be free from exces ive collap e and free from warping. Collapse is a inking
in of the fiber (see Plate IV, fig. 2) much in the same way that a rubber tube collapses when
subjected to an internal vacuum. Certain species are peculiarly subject to this phenomenon.
In ordinary commercial work, drying without loosening the knot.s or causing them to protrude is a prime consideration. In conditioning airplane stock it is of course unnecessary to
give consideration to this point, since all knots of any consequence are excluded.
hrinkage should be the minimum consistent with secming the other qualities. It is not
an independent factor; in fact, the very conditions most favorable for least shrinkage are also
hrinkage,
those most favorable to the development of internal stre ses and casehardening.
if not unreasonable in amount, must therefore be largely disregarded.

KILN DRYING OF WOODS FOR AIRPLANES.

35 9

There is no positive means of determining whether a piece of wood h a b een kiln dried or
ail' dried, if the drying has been properly done, except where the t emperatures used have been
ufficiently high to harden the r esins or gums or to discolor the wood. However, the outer
layer of kiln-dried wood only a few days out of the kiln is apt to b e considerably drier than the
inside, whereas air-dried wood will generally be of uniform moisture content because it has had
plenty of time for the moisture to equalize, or it may be even drier in the center than on the surface. But after the kiln-dried wood has bRen allowed to stand for several weeks, its moisture
may become evenly distributed.
EXACTING REQUIREME TS OF AIRPLANE STOCK.

For ordinary commercial purposes a reduction in strength of 15 or 20 per cen t b elow the
tanclarcl is of little or no importance in comparison with honey-combing, checking, and casehardening, which, in the order named, are'the most serious injuries Iik ly to occur. Collapse,
warping, and 100seninO" of knots are also of importance, but are not likely to give trouble in
any treatment which does not produce the first-named injuries. As these conditions are all vi ible to the eye, it is comparatively easy to adj u t the drying operation until they are eliminated.
Moreover, in most cases a slight chec~cing, particularly when these checks finally close up again,
is not con idered detrimental, and for some purpo es quite severe casehardening is not e pecially
objectionable. Unequal moisture distribution, however, is always bad, except for the very
roughest kind of work. Collapse, while quite common, does not occur in sufficient quantity
to cause trouble, and warping is usually avoidable by proper care in piling. Considerable leeway is therefore possible in ordinary commerical drying operations, which explains the wide .
diITerences in the methods used. Even so, however, enormous losses exist which might well
be wholly avoided by more care and intelligence in the treatment and in the· design of the kilns.
Moreover, the more exacting the requirements of the product, as for the best cabinet work,
tools, musical instruments, etc., the greater refinement is necessary in the drying process.
For airplanes, however, strength and toughness are the prime requirements, and these qualities can not be determined by visual inspection. This fact rendl3rs the drying of lumber for
airpbnes a much more difficult and refined operation than for most other purposes. Actual
mechanical tests are the only ,m eans of determining with any degree of certainty whether the
material comes up to the standard. Since the dry kiln ope.rator can not be guided by the
appearance of the material, it is necessary to follow quite strictly certain prescribed specifications itS to the drying operations. Different species require different treatments, as some ar
injured by conditions which are not h armful to others.
RELATION BETWEEN STRENGTH AND DRYNESS.

Dry wood is naturally very mueh stronge r than wet. T he crushing strength of green or wet
spruce is increased over fourfold merely by drying. l It follows that the question what effect
any particular proce s of drying has had upon the strength is necessarily a comparative one.
From the mere fact that it has been dried, the wood ha presumably been made stronger; the
question is to what extent, or in other words whether the maximum of strength has been obt ained. The answer to such a question can only b e given through a compari on with some
other drying process a sUlled as a standard. In m aking such a comparison the degree of dryn e obtained must also be taken into account, since the strength increases progressively with
reduction in the moisture content. For exampl e, air-dried material may be taken as a standard ..
In that case the comparison would b e made between kiln-dried material and air-dried wood of
the same moisture content.
'1'0 make this matter clear and to facilitate further discussion of the general subject it is necessary to have in mind the basic facts regarding the composition of wood and the manner in
which it dries.

II. HOW WOOD DRIES.
THE COMPOSITIO

OF WOOD.

Wood is made up of minute cells, arranged somewhat as the cells in a honeycomb except that
the cells in wood are very much longer in proportion to their width than in a honeycomb, and
are not as uniform. In the " softwoods" (gymnosperms) the vertical cells are fairly uniform
in shape and size; but in the " hardwoods " (angiosperms) they vary greatly, some being fifty
times as wide as others, the wide ones being termed "vessels" or " pores, " and the narrow ones
" wood fiber." Interspersed between the e vertical cells and fibers and lying in a horizontal
radial direction are the medu Uary ray , appearing as the" silver grain" on quarter-sawed oak.
The medullary rays are composed of short, blunt, thin-walled cells, similar to pith tissue, and
are haped like two-edged swords set edgewise.
Plate V is a cross section of a gymnosperm (Picea rubens), and Plate VI of an angiosperm
(Quercus rubra or borealis ), both magnified the same amount, 250 diameters.
The substance of which wood is composed is half as heavy again as water; its specific
gravity is 1.56. It is organic and consequently very complex in structure. The cell walls are
thought to be built up of small particles closely laid together, the inter tices being capable of filling
up with moisture. The foundation part of this substance is lmown as cellulose. With it is
combined another material called lignin which adds to the strength of the cell walls and gives
them a color.
M OIST URE AND ITS REMOVAL.

Wood in the living tree contains a great amount of moisture, varying from 30 per cent of the
dry weight in the heartwood of some conifers, to over 200 per cent in some of the hardwoods.
This moisture content must be greatly reduced before the wood is fit for use for most purposes.
In order to pass out from the interior of a board or timber the water must ordinarily pa s
transversely from cell to cell and evaporate from the surface. It is true that it can travel
lengthwi e very much more rapidly, as is evidenced by the end checking of lumber, but end
drying can not be counted upon for removal of moisture from the center of a long stick. This
process of transfusion from cell to cell is very slow, so that in ordinary air drying it takes I-inch
boards from six months to three years to reach 12 or 14 per cent moisture content, depending
upon, the kind of wood and the conditions under which it is dried.
In kiln drying, the process is greatly ha tened by increasing the temperature and the air
movement, thus increasing the rate of surface evaporation. Thi nece sarily increases the
differential in moisture content between the interior and the outer surface, since the rate of
tran fu ion of moi ture from the interior outward is partially proportional to thi moi ture
difference. While the increased temperature pre umably increa e the transfusibility of the
wood, it does not do so in proportion to the increa ed rate of surface evaporation. This necessary increase in the moisture difference brought about in order to hasten the ill'ying is what
causes the main dillicultie in the kiln drying of woods.
The e dillicultie are due to the changes which take place in the wood itself in connection
with the drying process after it has reached a certain point. Water exists in green wood in
two forms-as liquid water contained in the cavities of the cell and pores and as "imbibed"
or hygroscopic water intimately ab orbed in the ubstance of which the wood is compo ed.
The removal from the hole or pore of the free water will evidently have no effect upon the
physical propertie or shrinkage of the wood,! but as soon as any of the "imbibed" moisture is
1 An exception to this statement occurs in certain species,notablyin western red cedar (Thujaplicala),in eucalyptus,and in redwood (Sequoia
sempervir""s) , in which a collapse of the cell walls takes place in spots or bands during the evaporatiou of the free water. This collapse OCcurs only in

excessively wet regions and wben the wood is dried at too high a temperature. Tbeexplanalion of thispeculiar phenomenon appears to be that the
cell walls, which are practically impervious to air while wet, but through which water may readily pass, become soft and plastic when heated.
Under this condition those cells which are completely full of water to start with are subjected to an internal suction or tension produced by the
depletion of the water in the cavity by its evaporation through the cell walls. The cel ls then collapse like rubber tubes, one layer after another.

removed from the cell walls shrinkage begin to take place and other change occur. The
strength also begin to increase at thi time. The point "'here the cell wall or wood ub tance
becomes aturated is called the "fiber-saturation point," and is a significant point in the drying
of wood. In some cases the free water can easily be removed by heating it above its boiling
point, but in many ca e this will injure the wood and in others the water contained in the
cells themselves will not be forced out in this manner, only that from the open ve els or pore
passing off in vapor. The chief difficultie , however, come in evaporating the free \Tater where
it has to be removed through it gradual tran fusion through the ell wall in tead of by boiling.
The problem lie in the danger of drying the surface below its fiber- aturation point while free
water still remains in the interior.
The fiber- aturation point lies between a moisture condition of 20 pel' cent and one of 35
per cent of the dry weight of the wood, depending upon the specie.' In the living tree the
. wood is always above its fiber-saturation point.
PROPERTIES AND BEHAVIOR OF WOOD IN CONNECTION WITH MOISTURE REMOVAL.
GENERAL.

Different pecies vary greatly in the phenomena of drying. This is due to the fact that the
properties which all po sess in varying degree are combined in very diiIerent proportions. In
con equence the re pon e to a given set of conditions is of a widely diverse character.
One of these properties i the capacity to transfuse moisture. The rate of tran fusion
is very slow in some woods, as oak, and fairly rapid in others, as pine. The relation between
rate of transfu ion and temperature has already been mentioned in the prececli:ng section.
Transfusibility is, of course, the fundamental property of wood which makes drying possible,
and the art of drying consists in so controlling. transfusion, through control of the factors of
temperature, humidity, and circulation on which its rate depends, that the changes in the other
properties of wood which accompany drying are as favorable as po sible.
Hygroscopicity i a property of wood clo ely related to transfusibility. It is the property
by virtue of which wood substance absorbs or lose moisture in proportion to the relative
humidity of the air, the rate varying lightly according to the temperature.
Change in color occurs in orne pecies in drying. This is distinct from ap stain or colors
caused by fungus or bacteria. It is notable in hard maple sapwood and in ugar pine. In
the maple a moi t, warm atmo phere is conducive to this coloration.
Under moi t conditions combined with high temperature the wood ubstance becomes
soft and plastic, while, on the other hand, as the moisture falls below the fiber-saturation point
the wood sub tance hardens and stiffens. The effect of temperature upon plasticity varies
greatly with diiIerent species, some, a , for example, western red cedar, redwood, oak, and
eucalyptus, becoming excessively soft, even at temperatures as low as 150 0 or 170 0 F.
Tenacity, or cohesion between the fiber, easily breaks down with increase in temperature
in such woods as western larch and the southern wamp oaks, thus permitting inLernal stresses
to cau e checking with great readiness.
Brittleness is produced by excessive drying.
trength in wood is, of course, a very complex matter. It can not be discussed at length
here. It is not a single property, nor even strictly speaking a group of properties, but is of
various kinds, each kind being the result of more fundamental properties of the wood substance
and of its condition with respect to such matters as internal stresses, checks, and other defects .
The subject of the strength of woods for airplane stock is cove~'ed by another contribution to
this series of monographs, entitled "Effect of Kiln Drying on the Strength of Airplane Woods."
Among the phenomena which attend the drying of wood are two of such fundamental importance as to require further consideration. They are not independent, for the second is largely
an effect of the first, but must be discussed independentlY. Both afTect the strengLb as well as
the form of the wood. 'l'hey are shrinkage and ea ehardening.

HRINKAGE.

It was prcviou ly tated that shrinkage docs not take place until removal of the" imbibed II
water from the c 11 wall hegin. To this statement certain species of eucalyptus, oak, and probably other wood appear to present nn exception in that hrinkage begin at a moi ture condition of from 80 to 90 per cent of the dry weight. It is probable that this apparent hrinkage may
in reality be a form of collap e.
Wood hrinl- differently in different du-ection -as a rule it may be con idered to hrink
t'wice a much circumierentially a it doe radially, and about one-fiftieth as much longitudihrinkage continues until the ub tance
nally, although thi also varies in different pecie.
i perfectly dry (,-, oven dry"), and it becrin to swell again by ab orption of moi~ture a soon as
it is expo ed to moist air. Alternate hrinking and swelling is inevitable with changes in the
relati,e humidity of the surrounding air. Thi causes the so-called "working " of the wood.
Different pe ies vary greatly in this respect.
Wood hrinks more when dried slowly under moist condition , especially at high temperatUTe, than when ell-ied rapidly.1
CASEHARDENING.

Casehardening is a omewhat ambiguous term as commonly u ed. It ignifies in general a
hardened ca e on the outside of the wood. In metal tempering the arne word denote the condition produced when the outer urface of an iron cu ting is changed to teel by heat treatment
which remo,es part of its carbon. Doubtless the apparent analogy led to application of the
word to condition developed by heat treatment of wood. The analogy, however, is not a very
good one and should not he followed too clo ely.
In casoning wood a condition often a1'i s in which the outer portion has become dry and
hard, while the inner portion rem~ins wet and lose moisture so slowly that ell-ying eems almo 1,
at a stand till. 'I'hi condition i due to the fact that the outer portion ell'ied out faster than
tran fusion from the interior could take place, wit.h the eventual result that the wood subtance ha hecome hardened ana has largely lost its capacity to transfu e moisture. B ecause
of the hygroscopicity of wood, however, the outer portion may in time, under favorable
conditions, take up moisture again until a condition favorable to tran fusion i again e tablished, and drying may proceed at the normal rate. By teaming casehardened wood in this
condition the fiber can be very quickly softened so that the normal sea ouing proce s can be
resumed.
But ca ehardening involves other factorn. As the wood ell-ies it also shrinks. If the outer
and inner portion of a stick of wood dry unequally, there arises presently a condition in which
unequal sire es have been set up.
uch stre ~es are manife ted by a tendency to deforma tio n
if the wood i cut in the manner presently to be de cribed. From the standpoint of succe ful
conditioning of wood in a ell-y kiln the most important aspect of ca ehardening is that which
has to do with the unequal stresses which are brought about through unequal rates of shrinkage
between the outer and inner portions as moi ture is removed.
The e tre ~ e begin to be exerted a oon as a portion of the wood drie below it fiber aturation point.
ince it is impossible, practically peaking, to season the wood rapidly without
bringing about a condition in which unequal hrinkage takes place, a certain measure of ca ehardening may be aid to be inevitable in kiln ell-ying.
uch stres e do not occur, however,
to any appreciable amount when wood is very gradually sea oned, as in air drying under damp
conditions ..
But to under tand fully the phenomena of ca ehardening account must be taken of still
another factor. As soon as the moi ture content of wood passes the fiber satmation point it
begin not only to hrink but also to harden. The result i to set up a condition in which the
wood ha partially lost it capacity to hrink. It has become more rigid. Thi mayor may not
result in e tabli hing what may be called a permanent differential of shrinkages between the outer
and inner portions of the wood-that is, a condition in which one portion is always prevented
I

Probably this i a secondary result dependent upon the factors of casehardening and collapse.

by another portion from hrinking as much as it would jf free from a counteracting force. If such
a permanent differential i not established, the casehardening will be temporary; if it is e tablishod, the casohardening will be permanent.
Four variable factors, thon, are present in casehardoning, and affoct the result, namely,
moisture content of the wood, degree of htoinkago, internal stress, and the period at which the
fibers become hardened or set. These factors are partly dependent one upon the other. Temperature is still another factor, but may be treated as an indopendent variable.
OTHER EFFECTS OJ!' DRYING.

Warping results from unequal shrinkage or from a warped direction of the fibers. Cupping
is due to unequal shrinkage of slab cut boards radially and circumferentially and is simply
explained by geometrical relations.
Washboarding is due to unequal shrinkage of adjacent layers of the annual rings of wood,
and appears on radially sawed (quarter sawed) lumber. (ee Pl. VII.)
Collapse of the cells may occur in some species while the wood is hot and moist. Thi
collapse is distinct from the shrinkage which takes place in the wood substance and is due to
a different cause.
Checking and honeycombing are caused by unequal shrinkage, crooked grain, and ca ebardening.

ID. THE ART OF CORRECT KILN DRYING.

Were it not for the unequal shrinkage and the slow rate of transfusion of the moisture from
cell to cell, the drying of lumber would present no more difficulty than the drying of wet cloth
or clay. The problem of kiln drying wood would be merely one of conducting the requisite
amount of heat to the material to supply that required for vaporization, which at 163° F.
is 1,000 British thermal units of latent heat per pound of water, plus a small additional amount
(about 30 B. t. u. per pound of dry wood)! required to overcome the attraction of the hygroscopic material for the moisture. By use of a temperature higher than the boiling point corresponding to the given pressure, the moisture would pass off directly in proportion to the quantity of heat supplied. But the process is more complex in the case of wood.
EFFECT OF THE SURROUNDING CONDITIONS ON DRYING.

There are just three conditions which it is essential to control properly for correct drying:
(1) Circulation of the air, (2) humidity, and (3) temperature; and it is important that these
conditions be uniform throughout the kiln.
EFFECT OF CIRCULATION.

Unless the circulation is sufficient to convey throughout the pile of lumber the heat necessary for e,aporating the moisture, and also suffit:ient to cnrry awny the vapor, uniform drying
is impossible. The humidity of the air throughout the pile is dependent upon the circulation
For drying an isolated single stick of lumber circulation is unimportant, since the stick would
receive heat on all sides by convection or radiation and the moist vapor would pass away by
diITusion; but for a pile of lumber of any considerable size, a decided movement of the air
through the pile is necessary.
Since evaporation involves a consumption of heat and its transformation into latent heat,
and at the same time an increase in the humidity of the air immediately surrounding the object,
it is evident that drying in all parts of a pile of lumber can not take place under the same temperature and humidity condition at one and the same time. Where the air passes through a pile
in a definite direction the temperature is highest and humidity the least at the place where the
air enters the pile, and the temperature is lowest and the air dnmpest where it leaves the pile.
Consequently drying takes place progressively through the pile in the direction of the air circulation. The more rapid the r.irculation the more uniform will be the conditions throngh the
pile. Something of this same condition exi ts whether the circulation is in a definite direction
or is irregular, only irregulur circulation does not lend itself to analysis and variations are more
irregular and usually much greater in amount. Variations ot from 30° to 50° F. are not uncommon when circulation is indefinite, and humidity variations are from very dry to saturation.
EFFECT OF HUMIDITY.

If it were merely a question of evaporating moisture the most economical drying system
would be one in which the air entered the pile of lumber in the driest attainable cond tion
and left the pile in a saturated condition. 2 But the more important part played by the humidity
is its physical effect upon the wood. There is a natural balance between the hygroscopic moisture
assumed by wood and the relative humidity of the surrounding air at a given temperature. s
For the avoidance of checking and casehardening it is essential that the surface of the piece
of wood be kept comparatively moist while the water is passing from the center to the surface.
In other words, the surface must not dry at a more rapid rate than the moisture transfuses

from the center of the stick to the surfn.ce. This is brought about by retaining a definito amOlmt
of humidity in the air during the drying operation. This fact is of special significance in the
drying of green lumber, where the aim is to keep tho surface as near its fiber saturation point as
possible until all the free wate?' has evaporated from the center after which the moisture condi tion
of the surface can be gradually reduced by lowering the humidity. Humidity is also of importance in establishing the final moisture content before removal from the kiln. As there is
a definite relation between relative humidity and the percentage of moisture which the wood
will retain, it is evident that by regulating the final humidity in the kiln, overdrying may be
prevented.
EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE.

The temperature influences both the mechanical efficiency of the operation and the physical effect upon the wood. In general, the higher the temperature the more efficient is the
operation; but this is completely and definitely limited by the effect upon the wood. The
temperature at which drying may be safely conducted without injury to the material varies
greatly with different species. For example, oak must be dried to start with at not over 110 0
F., while Douglas fir for commercial purposes (not for airplanes) will stand over 225 0 F.
without appreciable injury.
The effect of high temperature is (1) to soften the fibres; (2) to reduce their cohesion in
tension, so that slight stre ses will cause separations or checking and honey-combing; (3) to
affect permanently the strength if certain limits are exceeded; (4) to tenu to increase the
shrinkage and produce collapse; and (5) presumably to increase the rate of transfusion of the
moisture through the wood. Chemical changes also occur and the hygroscopicity of the wood
is reduced.
.
These different effects are produced proportionally very differently in different species,
so that the resultant effect of a given temeruture with one species may be altogether unlike
that with another. Thus, high temperature greatly softens the fiber of oak but it reduces its
cohesion in a greater proportion, so that checking is more liable to occur at high than at low
temperatures. On t.he other hand, in most softwoods the cohesion is not reduced relatively
to so great an extent, consequently they may be dried at higher temperatures, normally than
oak and similar hardwoods.
On account of the softening of the fibers and the increased transfusion, casehardening is
less at a high than at a low temperature if the drying rate is the same in both cases.

IV. DI CUSSION OF DRY KILNS AND MEANS OF CONTROLLING THE ESSENTIAL
CONDITIONS.
A dry kiln i sometime thought of as a hot box or baking oven, or a a certain shaped
buildirig; rightly, however, it should be con idered as an apparatus for conditioning lumber
by supplying certain definite requirements. The e sential requirement are adequate and
uniform circulation throughout the pile of lumber; control of humidity at all time; control of
temperatUTe; and ability to team the lumber quickly and effectively whenever nece ary for
removal of casehardening and killing of mold. These essential have already been di cu. sed .
SYSTEMS OF KILN OPERATION.

There are two distinct way of handling lumber in kilns. One way is to place the load
in a chamber where it remains stationary throughout the operation, while the condition of the
drying medium are varied as drying progre ses. This is the "compartment" or " charge"
ystem of handling the lumber.
The other way. i to run the lumber on a wheeled truck into one end of a long chamber and
gradually hove it along toward the other end, where it is taken out when the drying i completed. An attempt is made to keep the end of the kiln where the lumber enters moist, and
the other end dry. This i known as the " progressive" system of operation, and is one commonly used in large operations. It is the less satisfactory of the two, however, where careful
drying is required, since tIre conditions can not be so well regulated and are apt to change with
every change of wind and with every new load of lumber introduced. It is not to be recommended for use with airplane stock.
The compartment system can be arranged so that it will require no more kiln space or handling of thelumber than the progre ive system; it does, however, require more intelligent operation, since the conditions in the kiln must be continually altered according to the progre of
the drying. Either of these two ystems may be u ed with almost any kind of dry kiln.
As a rule' the progres ive system employs a simple ventilated kiln such that the air enters at
the dry end (where the lumber is taken out) through ducts placed in the bottom beneath the
heating pipe, is heated as it rises between the pipes, thence passes through the lumber in a
horizontal direction, oppo ite to that in "hich the lumber is being moved, and is finally discharged through chimneys at the damp end. The heating pipes u ually extend only about
two-thirds the length of the kiln from the dry end. Such kilns vary in length from about 60
to 150 feet and in width from 1 to 24 feet, and are about 14 to 16 feet in height.
METHODS OF SECURI G CmCULATIO .

Pre SUTe and superheated steam treatments are not suitable for airplane material ; and the
vacuum treatment, though suitable, is hardly practicable. It will, therefore, uffice to consider
only atmospheric pres UTe treatments.
In general the circulation is produced in three way :
(1) By external draught or ventilation, where the air i taken in from the outside, conditioned, pa ed through the kiln, and allowed to escape to the outside again.
(2 ) By recirculating the air within the kiln itself and remoying the exce s moistUTe by
condensation.
(3) By forcing external air through the lumber by means of a fan or blower.
Combination of the e methods may al 0 be u ed.
o long as the fundamental requirement ah'eady specified are definitely eCUTed, anyone
of the e systems may be u ed for drying airplane lumber, but they are not all equally satisfactory. The mechanical features having to do with the operation of the kiln, the accuracy
and certainty of control of the conditions, and the amount ano uniformity of the circulation
cliffer greatly in their effectiv'enes in different type.

DRYI G OF WOODS FOR AIRPLANES.

367

VENTILATED KILNS.

In a purely ventilated kiln the circulation of air i u ually either entirely too sluggish for
drying green wood if the humidity i uniformly distributed, or if the draft is sufficient for
drying the green wood the changes in th humidity are excessive.
sually the deficiency of the
humidity in the air as it enters the lumber has to be made up by injecting live steam into the
current of incoming air. This arrangement is often precarious. Ohanges in temperature of the
outside air greatly affect the internal conditions. In general, ventilated kilns are not suitable
for drying green airplane wood. They are much more suitable for drying air-dried lumber
than green. It i difficult to maintain control of conditions in thi type of kiln.
evertheless,
for certain kind of drying uch a I-inch lumber of ea ily dried species a ventilated progressive
kiln i probably the implest, mo t ea ily operated, and mo t economical de ign pos ible.
RECIRCULATION KILNS.

In the ordinary type of recirculation kiln, pipe condensers are commonly u ed to remove
the exce s moisture from the air. Unless there i some additional means of increasing the cil'culation of the air, however, its natural movement i apt to be too slow for the rapid drying of
green lumber except at high temperatures and low humidities, which are prohibitive for airplane stock. In the Forest ervice humidity-regulated water-spray kiln,! which belong to the
internal-circulation class, the circulation i greatly accelerated by means of prays of water uniformly spaced the entire length of the kiln and placed in narrow chambers, one on either ide, or
in a single cl:eamber through the middle. The water sprays at the same time control the humidity of the air. This kiln has been largely used for drying airplane stock. Another means of
producing the needed circulation is by placing fans directly in the kiln itself, and thus forcing
the air through the lumber. The main difficulty of this plan is so to arrange the fans that a
uniform circulation is produced in all parts. Humidity control i also somew11at difficult of
accomplishment, as it depends upon leakages through the walls, canvas curtains or ventilators,
together with the injection of live steam through perforated steam pipes. This type of kiln has
been very successfully used in drying green airplane stock.
BLOWER KILNS.

In the thil'd class a blower or fan is used to force in new air. This is usually placed outside
of the kiln proper, and air is sucked out and returned to the drying chamber through
duct. Ventilation is secured by admitting more or les fre h air and allowing some of the return
air to escape. Accurate control of conditions is usually difficult to maintain, since the lightest
change in adjustments of the steam jets or of the dampers very quickly and progressively alters
the conditions in the kiln. Such an arrangement is in what might be considered unstable equilibrium. Where a battery of kilns is used, a separate blower is required for each kiln, otherwi e
they can not be operated as independent units.
cmCULATIO

CONTROL.

In the de ign of any kiln and method of piling it should always be borne in mind that the
load of lumber itself, partiCUlarly when first introduced, acts as a powerful condenser. The
evapor~ion is of it elf a cooling operation, and calculation shows that the effect of evaporation
is to increase the density of the humid air in spite of the fact that more vapor has been thereby
added. 2 This mean that there is a natural tendency of the air to descend as it pa ses through
the lumber, particularly when rapid drying is taking place. The arrangement of the pile of
lumber and the kiln, therefore, should be such as not to oppose but to assist the natural gravity
tendency. Success or failure sometimes hinge on this point. Extensive observations under all
kinds of conditions and in all kinds of kilns have ho\\o-n that thi theory of the downward tendency of the air through the pile is the correct principle.

HUMIDITY CONTROL AND STABLE EQUILIBRIUM.

Humidity control is brought· about in various way , and its accomplishment i the most
difficult problem in regulating the dry-kiln operation. In ventilated kilns the humidity is
usually varied by the amount the dampers are opened, the moisture added to the air being that
evaporated from the lumber. Very often steam jets are used where it is necessary to add humidity to the air; or vessels of heated water are used. In condenser kilns the temperature of the
pipe condenser is altered, to change the humidity, by altering the ilow of water through the
pipes.
team jets are also used to add humidity as required. In the blower kilns similar mean
are employed and, in addition, the dampers admitting fresh air are adjusted. In the Fore t
ervice water-spray kiln the humidity is automatically controlled by regulating the temperature
of the spray ","
ater. Hot water in the sprays gives a high humidity, while cold water acts as a
conden er and gives a low humidity. The control is very direct and the water acts in addition
as a stabilizer, preventing any sudden changes of conditions. The kiln is in a condition of what
might be termed stable equilibrium.
TEMPERATURE CO TROL.

This is the simplest problem with which the dry-kiln engineer has to deal in the design of a
dry kiln. When conditions are fairly uniform, the temperature may be approxim!1tely regulated
by turning on a greater or less number of steam pipes, if the piping system is installed in independent units. WhOlever high-pressure steam is available, tempemture may be largely controlleu
by means of a pressure-reducing valve. Both systems combined increase the ran~e obtainable.
Very steady temperatures may be thus maintained, but the difficulty is that when the temperature begins to change it may continue to rise or fall progressively, and if not closely watched will
soon pass the desired limits. Throttling steam valves by hand is not recommended.
The safest method is to use one of the many good makes of thermostat, hn.ving a control bulb
which may be placed anywhere desired in the kiln, and connected to the opern.ting mechanism by
a long, flexible tube. Any degree of accuracy of temperature control desired can be secured
by the use of a suitable instrument of this kind. Some are made to act directly upon the steam
valve by the expansion of vn.por contained in the bulb, or by the expansion of a liquid. Others
are made to operate through an au.,"'{iliary or relay system, the motive power of which consists of
air pressure or water pressure, which in turn operates a motor valve on the steam line.
For the most delicate control the air-pressure relay system has proved the best, while for
certainty action and simplicity one of the direct-acting systems is to be recommended. Anyone
of these systems is satisfactory, and no kiln for accurate drying should be operated without some
form of thermostat.
Heating systems as a rule consist of a series of ordinary iron pipes placed near the iloor of the
kiln. In blower kilns the air is often heated either by pipes or by furnace before it is forced into
the kiln. Sometimes ordinary radiators are used. Whatever the heater, the main thing is
to have it properly controlled and the heat uniformly distributed and constantly supplied.
A return bend system of piping has proved the most satisfactory for compartment kilns, as it
gives uniform heating at both ends of the steam coil. The header system, while more commonly
used, is apt to heat one end more than the other. This is particularly so when low-pressure
steam is u ed and in high-pressure systems when a thermostat is placed on the feed line. If the
traps fail to operate properly or the pipes become air bound, the drainage end is certain to be
colder than the supply end. The return bend system, made up of several separately controlled
coils of pipes, is strongly recommended. One-inch piping is very commonly used for dry kiln
and often Ii-inch and occasionally q-inch piping. For lOw-pressure steam the larger pipe i~
preferable.
Temperature control is especially importn.nt in drying airplane stock, since if certain limits
are exceeded the strenath and toughness are affected.

v.

DETERMINATION OF CONDITIONS IN KILNS.

IMPORTANCE OF ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF CONDITIONS FOR AIRPLANE STOCK.

For airplanes, strength and toughness are the prime requirements, and these qualities can not
be determined by visual inspection. Actual mechanical tests are the only means of determining
with any degree of certainty whether the material comes up to the standard. These tests in
order to be determinative must be made upon matched material from the same sticks, and the
testing of the material and analysis of results is extremely complicated and difficult. How these
tests have been made for a number of species at the Forest Products Laboratory, and the results
secured, are set forth at length in Report No. G8.
The fact that strength conditions can not be satisfactorily determined by visual inspection
alone when airplane material is concerned renders the drying of such material a much more
difficult and refined operu.tion than that of drying lumber for most other purposes, and necessitates that the operator follow strictly certain prescribed specifications.
USE OF THERMOMETERS AND HYGROMETERS.

A single thermometer reading should never be relied upon, and it may be necessary to place
thermometers in a dozen or more different places in the kiln and take readings of them all frequently throughout the entire run until the proper place for taking the controlling conditions has
been determined upon. All thermometers should be checked together occasionally by pJacing
their bulbs together and surrounding the set of bulbs with some insulating material, such as a
dry woolen cloth. The kiln should be controlled not by an average of the various readings, but
according to the conditions at some point or points carefully selected, after a study of all the readings. The success of the run may depend largely upon the judgment used in choosing the
proper places for measuring the conditions. If tho readings at the different positions in the
kiln appear to be inconsistent, sets of readings should be taken at short intervals, both at a time
when the temperature is rising and again when it is falling, and the thermometers moved about
until consistent readings are obtainable. It is not always easy to predict where 'the hottest portion of the kiln will be, and even when this is found it may not necessarily correspond t.o the air
temperature entering the pile of lumber. Furthermore, the air may enter the lumber at one
place during the beginning of the run and at another place at the finish, in which case the place
for measuring conditions controlling the run must be shifted accordingly. Or there may be no
apparent place which might be considered as "entering air". In this case the hottest portion
of the pile should be chosen as supplying the condition for controlling the run.
Since it is assumed that material from any portion of the pile is likely to be used in manufacture, it is necessary that no portion of the pile be subjected to conditions more severe than
those specified. Hence it is necessary to govern the entire kiln by the most severe conditions
to which any portion of the pile may be subjected, irrespective of whether other portions are
drying too slowly or not.
In dry kilns where the circulation of the air is in a known direction, the proper place at which
to measure temperatures and humidities for controlling the drying run is where the air first
enters the pile of lumber. In the water-spray kiln this place is in the warm air flue (opposite
the spray chamber side of the pile), about half way up the pile and about the midclle of the flue.
Ordinarily a thermometer or hygrometer so placed will not need to be shielded from radiation.
RECORDING THERMOMETERS.

While not essential, recording thermometers are very useful not only in furnishing a permanent record of the run but also in indicating how to control the conditions. While optical
readings of glass thermometers give only points in the curve of operation, the recorder gives a
continuous record; and it is very easy to learn from the recorder whether conditions are steady,
variable, rising, or falling.
Unfortunately, recording thermometers have not proved altogether reliable and they
should not be wholly depended upon. Standard glass thermometers should always be used in
the kiln in addition to the recorders. The recorders should also be checked frequently with a
standard glass thermometer.
369

370

A "NUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The recorders most useful in dry-kiln work are those in which the measuring bulb is connected with the recording instrument by a long, flexible capillary tube filled with a fluid. The
bulb is plaeed at the point where the temperature is to be measured, and the recording instrument in a convenient room, which should be at a lower temperature than the bulb.
These in truments are of four types, according to whether the fluid in the bulb and tube is
(1), mercury, (2) some nonvolatile liquid, (3) gas, or (4) a volo,tile liquid which produces the
pres ure on the operating spring tlu'ough vaporization of a portion of the liquid.
In the first three types it is important that the spring in the recording ca e and that portion
of the tube not subjected to the temperature to be measured be kept at a fairly uniform temperature, since any changes in the temperature of any portion of the fluid contents .,,,ill affect
it pressure according to the relative volume affected. Compensating devices are usually
attached to such instruments supposed to correct for such changes, but experience shows that
they do not always compensate with complete satisfaction, especially in the case of the liquidfilled instruments.
The only instrument which is not subject to changes in temperature of any part of the
vessel is one filled with a volatile liquid and its vapor.
ince the action of this instrument is
produced solely by the pressure of saturated vapor and not by the expansion of the liquid or
o-as, it is not affected by temperatures which are lower than the temperature of the bulb. It
action is the same as that of a steam pressure gauge; in fact, the thermometer is in reality nothing
more than a aturate vapor pre sure gauge; and since the pre ure of aturate vapor is alway
the same at a given temperature, independent of the volume or of the lower temperature of the
liquid, this form of thermometer is the most accurate and reliable if properly used. The main
precaution is that no portion of the tube or the spring must be heated above the temperature
of the bulb. The tube and spring will then be full of the liquid, and the vapor will be generated
in the bulb in the presence of some of the liquid, which is always sufficient to fill part of the
bulb as well [\,s the tube and spring.
This form of instrument may be at once distinguished from the other tla.ree forms by the
divisions on the dial, which in the others are uniformly spaced but in the vapor instrument
widen out as the temperature increases. In one make a patented device is attached which
comes into action at a prescribed temperature and narrows down the spacings.
In the gas-filled instrument it matters not at what height the recording dial is placed
relative to the bulb; but in the liquid and vapor instruments the vertical height of the liquid
column exerts a pressure, which requires a readjustment of the hands when this height is altered.
PLACEME T OF RECORDING THERMOMETERS.

For the water-spray kiln the vapor form of instrument is recommended. Two separate
bulb operating on one dial are de irable, one to record the dew point, the other to record the
entering air temperature. The dew-point bulb should be placed in the lower opening of one of
the baffie boxes, on the spray-chamber side, but in such a manner that it does not receive the
direct spray of water nor rest directly on the floor; and the tubing should extend through the
spray chamber itself to the end of the kiln and pass directly out through ~he end wall. . Thi
i to insure that no portion of it becomes heated above the bulb temperature. The case al 0 mu t
be situated in a room which is eooler than the dew-point temperature to be measured. Caro
should be taken to see that the bulb is placed in a "live" part of the spray chamber and not.
where the conditions of spray or circulation are abnormal from any cau e.
The bulb for measuring the temperature of the air entering the lumber (dry bulb) should
be suspended in the warm air flue about half way to the top of the pile and midway acro s the
lIue, and the tubing hould be carried horizontally on a level with the bulb through the flue t.o
the end of the kiln and thence through the wall to the in trument. It must not pa s near any
hot pipes. So placed, the bulb need not be shielded from radiation. It is important that thi
bulb does not lie on lin~ with the space between the ends of two piles, but it should come somewhere near in line with the middle of the pile. The same applies also to the dew-point bulb,
since the circulation will be apt to be abnormal between the piles, and the true conditions of the
ll.lr which enters and leaves the pile would not be correctly registered.

VI. HOW TO CONDUCT THE DRYING OPERATION.
METHOD OF PILING.

In general lumber should be so piled as to afford free passage of the air throughout, and so
that the air will pass through the pile and not around it. It is frequently advantageous to
hang canvas curtains in such a manner as to prevent the air from short-circuiting the pile.
Remembering that the drying takes place progressively through the pile, it is evident that
the pile should not be made too large, as otherwise what is gained in size will be lost in time of
drying. This applies also to the question of how close together to place the sticks. If the pile
is too crowded, the increased capacity will be lost in slowless of drying. Again, if the lumber
is too openly piled the capacity of the kiln is unduly cut down without a compensating gain in
time of drying. It is better to err on the side of too open rather than too close piling, since no
harm will result other than loss in capacity, whereas too close piling may result in very uneven
drying.
The greater the circulation in the kiln, the larger and closer may be the pile. For an ordinary condenser kiln without forced circulation it is generally desirable to allow about twice as
much air space as solid lumber in the pile. Thus, for 3 by 4 inch wing-beam material 2-inch
stickers and 2-inch spacings are preferable. Where high circulation is attainable this may be
cut down to equal parts, or even to 6 parts solid to 5 parts open. Thus for 3 by 4 inch wing
beams, 1 or It inch stickers with I! to 2 inch horizontal spacings may be used. For I-inch
boards I-inch stickers should be used, when there is high circulation, and H-inch for low
circulation.
In the water- pray kiln and in pipe condenser kiln the lumber should be run lengthwise of
the kiln and the individual pile should not exceed 8 feet in height and 5 feet in width. An
open flue of 1 inches should be left through the center of the kiln between the two 5-foot piles,
and at least 12 inches between the lumber and the side walls.
A suitable method of piling wing-beam stock is illustrated in Plate VIII, which shows one of
the kilns at the United tates ignal Corps cut-up mill at Vancouver, Wash., opened for unloading. This kiln is loaded with 3 by 5 inch Douglas fir wing-beam stock.
Unless the drying takes place evenly from both surfaces of the boards there is a strong tendency for them to cup. Consequently the arrangement of the pile with respect to the movement of the air is of great importance from this point of view.
TESTS OF MATERIAL DURING AND AFTER DRYING.

For correct drying and the control of the whole operation it is essential to know currently
the condition of the wood in various portions of the pile in regard to moisture, casehardening,
and checking, as well as the temperatures, humidities, and air movements. Tests of the material
must therefore be made as often as required. There are two means of acquiring this information; namely:
(1) By the direct-test method.
(2) By the sample-piece method.
The following tests are to be made:
(1) Average moisture.
(2) Moisture distribution.
(3) Casehardening.
OffiECT-TEST METHOD.

One means of ascertaining this information is to pull out sticks of the wood from different
places periodically and to test them for moisture and casehardening. Such tests must be made
at a considerable distance (2~ or 3 feet) from the ends of the sticks, as otherwise they are liable
to give erroneous conclusions due to the ends of the sticks having dried very much faster than
the centers. It is frequently difficult if not impossible, however, to pull out representative
material from the piles during the progress of tho drying, and another method must be resorted to.
371

372

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERO "AUTIO .
SAMPLE-PIECE METHOD .

This method can be best applied . by preparing suitable sample pieces beforehand and
inserting them into suitable pockets left in the sides of the piles when the lumber is first loaded.
The samples should be representative material, cut from near the center of the chosen sti k
and not less than 2} feet in length. They should include some of the wettest as well a the
average material, otherwi e the load is likely to be considered dry before the wettest pieces
have reached the required dryness. A I-inch moisture disk should be taken from either end of
the sample at the time of its preparation and immediately weighed on a delicate balance. The
sample also should be weighed within a few minutes of the di ks. The ends of the sample '
should then be thoroughly coated with thick asphaltum varni h, or be dipped in melted rosin
100 parts, lampblack 7 parts. The samples are then ready to be placed in the load in the
pockets left for them. When samples are thus in place they should lie in exactly the same

relative positions as the other sticks in the pile, the ends being pieced out by the ends of the
sticks from which they were cut and they must be readily accessible so that they can be removed and replaced as often as desired. By first estimating the dry weights of the samples
and then weighing them periodically during the drying run, the progress of the drying of the
load may be kept track of currently.
How many samples to take will require judgment. They must be representative, but
the more uniform and regular the drying conditions are in the kiln and the more uniform the
material to be dried, the fewer will be required. Ordinarily at least four sample, two placed
on the entering air side of the pile and two on the loaving air side, will be required, and frequently double this many.
Dry weight of the sample pieces is readily estimatod as follows: Let Al and BI be the wet

APPENDIX I.
DRYING SPECIFICATIONS FOR AIRPLANE STOCK.

At the beginninO' of the war, the Fore t ervice was already in posses ion of knowledge,
derived from years of cxperimental tudy, to cnable it to offer immediately a method by which
it \Va believed that kiln drying could be accompli heel without injury to the matei'ial. The
Fore t 'ervice was in a better po -ition than allY other organization or indiyidual to recommend
suitahle methods and apparatu for drying airplane tock. Drying specification wero prepared
for the Signal Corps, hased on the la1O'wiedge and experience then available. They were first
drawn on July 2, 1917, and have been employed without significant change.
The nece sity for c' tahli hing beyond que ti011 the afety of the original drying conditions
given in these pecifications, however, was apparent, a well as the need to a certain their application to untried species and to estahlish limiting conditions as to severity of treatment beyond
which it would he un afe to go. This called for an exhau. tive 'erie of strength te t upon

CO STA T DEW-POINT SCHED LE FOR DRYING DOUGLAS FIR,

PRUCE, AND SIMILAR WOOD.

An improvement over the suhedule in the original specifications for drying species listed
under Table I of ignal Corp, l nited tates Army, specification 20500-A, was worked out, by
Lhe us of a 'Oll'tant dew point of 1] 5°, and is hown in Plate III. Thi somewhat simplifies
Lhe control of the operat,ion, especially in the water-spray kilns, where the dew point is used
as the controlling element of the humidity. The chedule here given i equally good with the
[or mer, and ha already been put into u e.
If marked ca ehardening becomes apparent it hould be l' moved by steaming for two or
three hour::; at 160° once or twice nea,r the end of the run, a indicated by "8" in the plate of
CUl'\'es. If no Yery seyere casehardening develops, a high humidity for one day just before
the close of the run, without rai 'ing the temperature, may suffice.
teaming at a temperature
of 160° for not over one hour sho uld always be resorted to if sever e casehardening develops
at any tage of the run , buL is noL ordinarily neces ' ary if the given schedule be adhered to.
In figure 5, T is the temperaLure of the ail' entering the pile of lumber, in degrees Falu'enheit,
D is the dew point, H is the r elative humidity per cent, and M i the normal drying curve of the.

382

KILN DRYING OF WOODS FOR AIRPLANES.

383

The essential feature of this kiln is control of the humidity and the production of air circulation by means of a series of water sprays, spaced short distances apart and running the
entire length of the kiln and operating,in narrow flues about 12 to 16 inches in width and about
6 feet deep.
One flue is placed on e-ither side of the kiln, as shown in figure 6; or a .single flue may be
place-d in thc center. The spray of water is directed downward with considerable force, and
produces a large movement of air, which, after leaving the baffle plates at the bottom of the
spray chambers, rises through the heating coils and upward through the central flue between
Lhe- piles of lumber; hence it passes downward and outward to the spray flues again.
The humidity is regulated by the temperature of the spray water, the air being brought
t.o a condition of complete aturation in its pa sage through the sprays of water. Cold water
rrduces humidity and hot water raises it, ince the- temperature of the air as it leaves the bottom
of tlw spray chamb:'rs is the dew point of the air after it is hoa ted in passing through tho beating
pipc ' . Thus, thc humidity of the air delivered to the lumber is controlled by controlling the
dew-point temperature.
Zigzag haffle plate' aI" ananged at the bottom of the spray chamber to remove all free
particles of water and leayc the ail' in a clear saturated condition as it enters the stcam pipes
Conden er are al 0 placed abovc the spray chamber, to bc used ncar the end of thc run when a
low humidity but not much air circulation is required , and a higb-pre ure t am pray pipe is
placed in the spray chambers for use in relieving casehardening. ThC:'re arc no ventilators,
and the kiln is Lightly closed, thc same air being recirculated over and over.
Only these essential parts need be mentioned here , since in this brief di cussion a complete
de ign of the kiln i not intended and tbe planning of new kilns or the modification of old ones
would need to be taken up in detail according to l' quirement .

REPORT No. 66.
GLUES USED IN AIRPLANE PARTS.
By S. ,V.

ALLEN AND

T. R.

'I'JtUAX.

This report was prepared for the ~ational _
'HlvisOl'Y Committee for Aeronautics and
presents the results of investigations conducted by the Forest Products Laboratory
of the United :::;tates Forest :::;ervice, at the request of and with funds provided by
the Bureau of Construction and Repair and the Bureau or Steam Engineering of the Navy
Department, and the Bureau of Aircraft Production of the ,Val' Department. Some of the
general statements are taken from the literature on glues existing previous to the time that
the laboratory undertook this line of investigation. •

GENERAL STATEMENT ON IBNDS AND SOURCES OF GLUE.
There are many kinds of glue, some of which huye been known lor a long time. The kind
to be used in any particular case depend upon the chantcter of the material to be held together
and upon the use to which the finished article is to be pnt.
trength, for in tance, is usually
the important requirement for glue to be used for joint work; cheapness may be more important than strength in the manufacture of low-grade plywood and other inexpensive articles; and water-resistance is demanded of the glues to be u ed in airplanes, certain kinds of
sporting goods, and other glued "ork which i to be exposed to the weather or to high humidity.
For the purpose of thi discussion, glues \yill be divided into fi,-e types, which will be
designated as follows:
1. Animal glues, which are made from the hides, hoofs, horns, bones, and fleshings of
ar..imals, principally cattle. These glue. J1lu.t be mixed with water and melted.
2. Liguid glues, which are commonly made from the head, skins, bone, and swimming
bladders of fish . Some liquid glue, ho"ever, are made from animal glue and from other
materials. They come in prepared form ready for immediate u e.
3. Vegetable glues, which are made from starch, usually cassava starch, and sold in
j:o\ydered form. Ordinarily they require heating with water and alkali for preparation.
4. Casein glues, which are made from casein, lime, and certain other chemical ingredients.
1 hey are commonly sold in powdered form,. requiring only the addition of water.
5. Blood albumin glues, which are made from black soluble blood albumin, a product
recovered from the blood of animal.. These glues must be mixe 1 ju. t before u e, ince they
deteriorate rapidly in standing.

ANIMAL GLUES-THEIR MANUFACTURE, PREPARATION, AND APPLICATION.
MANUFACTURE OF ANIMAL GLUE.

The proce s of making animal glne i hriefly a follO\ys: The. tock is wa hed and treated
to renlove dirt and grease, and then boiled to convert the glue-forming substances into a
glue solution. This solution i concentrated by evaporation until it will form a jelly on
\:ooling. The jelly is then cut into various forms and dried.
There :11'e many details and variations which depend upon the kind of stock used and
lJw plant in which the glue is made, and which affect more or less the character of the resultant
glue. Bones are sometimes boiled without first removing either dirt or grease. This practice
387

388

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COM~nTTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

naturally fails to produce a high-quality glue. Bones mayor may not be treated with acid
to remove the calcium salts before cooking; and this all'o influences the glue quality. In
vooking, the temperature and time must be carefully watched, as oyer-cooking may materially
reduce the strength of the glue. The stock is usually boiled with fresh water several tinH', .
The fir t boiling or first run gives the best glue) and each later a weakel'.
As the solution of glue from the boiling kettles is too weak to form a jelly which can
be handled, it must be concentrated. This is done by boiling off the water in vacuum dryer
l1ntil the percentage of glue in the solution is high enough to make a firm jelly on cooling. If
the temperature rises too high during the concentrating process the quality of the glue mr.y
ue lowered.
When sufficiently concentrated the glue solution is cooled by refrigeration, eithel' after
ueing run into pans Dr as it runs upon a traveling belt. As it cools it form a jelly firm enough
to handle. The jelly in the pans is removed. sliced with wires or a knife, and placed 11 pon
screens to dry. If a belt is used the jelly is formed in a continuous sheet, which is cut into
pections and placed on screens as it travels along. The screens are then placed in a drying
dlHlllber and left until the glue is dry. Glue may be easily injured during the drying proce s
i:!.' the temperature :onditions are not properly controlled .
The form of the glue "d1en dry depend. npon the shape in which it \"a _ placed upon lhe
s<:r enf'. If carefully lieec1 to the propel' thickne.. l'cglllarl,r shaped cake. ",i]] be formed. The

MIXING AND APPLICATION OF A IMAL GLUE.

In using animal glue Yariolls precaution. 11m t be ob ened if . aLisfncto[.y l'esu ll are to
be obtained. By improper use a very high-grade glue may be made to give poor joinl~ . It
is important, first, to find out the right proportion of glue and water to use in order to get
the be t result with the wood that is being emplo~'cd and the conditions under "'hich the work
i being done. This is laro'ely a matter of experience, but it can al 0 be determined by strength
le,t. When the right proportions hn.ve been decided upon, they hould be strictly adhered to
thereafter, and the glue and water should be weighed out when making up a new batch of
glue rather than measured or guessed at. Clean, cold water should be u ed, and the mixtme
thol'()llO'hly stirred to prevent lump. It hould then stand in a cool place until the glue is

GLUES USED IN AIRPLANE PARTS.

thoroughly water-soaked and oftened. Thi may take only an hour or t,,·o, or it may take all
njght, depending upon the size of the glue particles. It should then be melted over a water
bath. The temperature should not be allowed to go higher than 3ibout 150 0 F.; high temperatures and long-continued heating reduce the strength of the glue. The glue pot should be
kept c.overed as much as possible in order to prevent the formation of a skin or scum over the
surface of the glue.
The room in which the glue is used should be as warm as possible without causing too
much discomfort to the workman, and it shoulc1 be free from drafts. In a cold drafty
room the glue cools too quickly and may set before the joint has been put into the clamps. The
result is a weak joint. It is also considered good practice to warm the wood before applying
the glue, but it should not be heated long enough to cause an appreciable moisture change.
Wood should never be glued when it is colder than room temperature, and, of course, only
thoronghly seasoned wood should be used. Since high-strength animal glues set so quickly
on cooling, they should be applied and the joints clamped as quickly as is consistent with good
workmanship.
In clamping, the pressure should be evenly distributed over the joint so that the faces
will be in contact at all points. The amount of pressure to give the best results :is a question
which has never been definitely settled. Apparently no tests have yet been made to show the
best pr-essure to use on edge or fiat grain joints. In gluing veneers it is necessary to use high
pressmes in order to flatten out the irregularities of the laminations. Pressures as high as
150 pounds per square inch are sometimes used, but it is not established that such high pressures are neces. ary or desirable. Too much pre.'3snre mu t not be used in gluing surfaced wood,
us the glue may be pressed out too completely :from the joint, producing a so-called starved
joint.
Strict cleanliness of glue pots and apparatus and of the floors and tables of the glue room
hould be observed. Old glue soon become foul and affords a breeding place for the bacteria
I"hich cause decomposition. The fresh glue is, therefore, in constant danger of becoming contaminated. Glue pots and brushes should be washed after every day's work. The brushes
will remain sweet if kept when not in use in a weak solution of carbolic acid. Glue enough
for a day's nm only should be mixed at one time, so that mixed glue will not have to be held
over from one day to another. If these sanitary precautions are Dot observed, poor joints may
result.
STRENGTH OF ANIMAL GLUE.

The highest grades of animal glue are the strongest glues used in woodworking. Their
Etrength is greater than that of the woods they are used upon, and when they are properly
appliecl they are exceedingly reliable, so long as they are not exposed to moisture. The certified glue used in propeller manufacture was sufficiently strong for the highest type of woodworking. but still higher grades of glnc arc obtainable. The certified glues were required
to have an average shearing strength1 of 2,400 pounds per square inch, with a minimwn of
not less than 2,200 pounds per square inch. Most of them, however, actually showed an average shearing strength of betwecn 2,500 and 3,000 pounds per square inch.
The shearing strength of the lower grades of animal glue, such as 1! and less, is somewhat lower, but by careful application fairly high valnes can be obtained from them.
The water-resi.stance of animal glue is low; but the high grades, whith have high jelly
strenoth will stand dampne s for longer periods than the low grades, which have low jelly

LIQUID GLUES-THEIR MANUFACTURE, PROPERTIES, AND USES.
Liquid- glues vary over an exceedingly wide range, not only in their appearance and properties but. also in their chemical constituency. Most of them are manufactured from the heads,
bones, swimming bladders, and other offal from fish.
The process is somewhat similar to that used in the manufacture of animal glues. The
offal is thoroughly washed with water and then discharged into extractors and digested with
live steam. After digestion the liquid is drawn off and allowed to stand, following which the
upper oily layer is removed. The lower gluey solution is then clarified with alum, filtered,
concentrated in open vats, and bleached with sulphur dioxide. The resulting glue is a lightbrown viscous liquid of extremely disagreeable odor. It is sometimes treated with sodium
phosphate or perfumed in order to make the odor less offensive. Dextrine, certain gum an 1
resins, starch, casein, rubber, and bitumen also find occasional use in the manufacture of liquid
glues.
A :few liquid glues are made with animal glue as a base by treating the latter with a
·helllical agent that destroys the power of the glue to form a jelly, and by mixing it with a
thinner which evaporates when the glue is used and permits it to set.
A good liquid glue has certain advantages. It can be used cold and pread without any
preparation whatever. On the other hand, it is not generally so strong as high-grade animal
or casein glues, is more expensive, and not so widely marketed. Its use in airplanes is confined
to repair work and well-protected parts. The majority of purchaser have no way of knowing in advance how satisfactory a liquid glue will prove to be. Some preliminary studies made
at the F.orest Products Laboratory indicated that the strength of liquid glue varies with its
" body" or viscosity. As a rule, a thick viscous glue will give high . trength and vice versa.
The body or viscosity is also important because it influences the amount of glue which may
be maintained in a joint when pressing. A thin glue will spread a larger area, but the layer
on the wood will be so thin that there is danger of squeezing it out under pressure and producing a weak, or "starved," joint. Other qualities desirable in liquid glues are ability to
dry and set rapidly when spread on wood urfaces, and to remain liquid while in the container
and over ordinary ranges of temperature.

CASEIN GLUES-THEIR MANUFACTURE, PREPARATION, AND APPLICATION.
One or the many direct r esults or the war has been the introduction or casein glues into
the woodworking indu tt'ie of this country. Previ6u. ly the e glues had been used in Europe
to a limited extent in bookbinding and cabinet work, but their production on a large scale
was unknown. In the United States the use or ca ein glues is more recent and their development has been more rapid than in Europe. At the beginning or 1918 only one plant in this
country was manufacturing a water-resistant casein glue. 'Vith our entrance into the war the
demand of the Army ani Navy for waterproof ply-wood enormou ly increa ed the production,
~ o that by the latter part or 1918 rour different companie were manura turing casein waterreo istant glues and the Forest Products Laboratory had developed everal rormula ror making
them.
TYPES OF CASEIN GLUES.

There are, in general, two types of casein glues ,vhich for convenience may be designated
as prepared glues and wet-mix glues. In the former, th~ glue components are mixed dry;
while in the latter, the ingredients are ad de I separately and at different times during the mixing process. Casein glues on the market are of the dry-mix type; that i , they are prepared
and shipped 'ready to add to water. The Fore t Products Laboratory ha done a large amolUlt
of work in developing casein glues, and some of the best formula are of the wet-mix type,
MA UFACTURE OF CASEIN.

. The principal constituent of all casC'in glues is ca ein a product obtained from mille.
When mi lk sours naturally, casein is precipitated and appear as" curd ." 'Vhen produced
in this way it is known as self-soured or naturally soured casein. Various acids may be added
to the milk to precipitate the casein, the pl'incipal one::; used being hydl'ochloric (muriatic)
and sulphuric. Rennet is also used to some extent a a precipitating agent.
The usual steps in the production or casein are: (1) Removal of fat in the rorm of cream
from the milk, which is usually accomplished by means of a separator; (2) precipitation of the
casein; (3) washing to remove the acid and other impurities; (4) drying; and (5) grinding
to a powder. The care used in these various steps of manufacture has a large effect upon the
glue-making properties of the casein.
The principal requirements of casein to make it de irable ror glue making are : (1) A
low percentage or impurities such as acid, moisture, and fat; (2) freedom from sour odors;
(3) clearness and lUlirormity of color; and (4) fineness or particles. By grinding a casein
to fine particles a minimum of time is required in the mixing and a more uniform glue is
obtained. A casein ground to pa s through a screen of from 50 to 60 me hes to the inch will
give good results.
MA UFACTURE OF GLUE.

To produce glue, casein is ' mixed with other ingredients, the chief of which are lime and
water. These three constituents alone will give a glue of good water-resistant properties,
but of short life. Other ingredients are, therefore, added to increase the working life and the
'vater resistance and to improve the other qnalitie of the glue. Caustic soda, sodium fluoride,
and sodium silicate are used in some patented formula. They all lengthen the life of the
glue. and sodium fluoride probably gives the glue anti eptic properties. Still other ingredients
are added to give the glue some particularly desired property. Oils are 1.1 ualJy added to the
dry-mix glue to prevent du ting in handling the glue. Formula vary, therefore, not only in
materials used but also in the proportions of different ingredients.

A.r. NUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Several formulas for mixing casein glues have been developed at the Forest Products Laboratory. One of the best of these, with a discus ion of the method of mixing and a descripti.on
of materials required, follows.

70 parts silicate of soda
METHOD OF MIXING.

The proper quantity of water is introduced into the glue pot, and the mixing blade is
brought into action at a speed corresponding to about 50 or 60 revolutions per minute. The
stirring is allowed to continue dur~ng the addition of the casein to the water and for a few
minutes thereafter until the mixture becomes mu h-Jike in consistency through the absorption
of the free water by the casein. The blade is then stopped. and the mixture allowed to soak.
After a period of 15 minutes the soaking is considered complete and the mixing blade
i again brought into action. The lime-water mixture is now added and two or three minutes
later the liquid silicate of soda is introduced.
The mixing is allowed to continue for from 20 minutes to one-half hour after the addition
of the sihcate of soda, whereupon a smooth, freely flowing mixture, of l.miform texture and
free from lumps, should be produced.
Usually some experience in the mixing of this glue. is necessary before satisfactory results
can be expected, and it is advisable to have a new operator witness an actual demonstration.
This is due to the fact that no precise quantity of water can be prescribed because of the vari.ation in the water-absorbing qualities of different caseins. The criterion of whether or not the
proper quantity of soaking water has been added is the viscosity of the finished (mixed) glue.
If its consistency is too thin, an excess of water beyond that required has been used, and it
is best to reject the batch and try again. Similarly, if the consistency is too thick and heavy,
an insufficient quantity of water has been used. The water required for various types of casein
lies in the following ranges:
Lactic-acid casein_________________________________________________________ 130 to 170 parts water
SuIP~UriC-a?id ~asein-~-~---- - --------------------- ------------------------} 170 to 220 parts waleI'
Hydrocblol'lc-acld casem __________________________________________________ _
Rennet casein____________________________________ ___ _________________ ____ .280 parts water
DESCRIP1'ION OF MATERIALS .

Oasein.-It is essential that the casein be of a reasonably pure grade, carefully manufactured , free from offensive odors, not of a dark yellow, dirty, or other objectionable color,
and low in fat, as well as in free acid. It should be fine enough to pass through a 50-mesh sieve.
Lime.-A. high calcium lime gives satisfactory resu l ts~ but limes containing a relatively
large amount of magnesia can be employed if a quantity sufficient to give the required calcium
hydroxide content be used. It can be prepared for use by adding just enough water to fresh
quicklime to cause it to slack to a powder. It should then be made fine enough to pass entirely
through a 60-mesh sieve. Commercial powdered hydrated lime are also suitable.
Silicate of soda.-The silicate of soda is in liquid form and corresponds to the grade
which appears on the market for preserving eggs or for adhesive purposes. The various
samples which haye given satistaotory results at this laboratory have had analyses included
wi thin the following ranges:

This formula gives a glue of considerable water resistance. It has formed the basis for a
large part of the later experimentaJ work on casein glues at the Forest Products L a:boratory.
By modifying the proportions of materials and adding still other components glues of very
dE'~
"iirable qualities are obtained. The degree of water-resistance and the workable life of the
glue after mixing can be greatly varied. This property of the wet-mix glues, namely the
variation of the components to attain glues of special qualities is one of the chief advantaO'e
over the dry-mix type. The dry-mix glues on the other hand require less technical knowledge
on the part of the u er than do the wet-mix type.
PREPARED CASEIN GLUES.

Commercial casein water-resi tant glues are of the dry-mix type, of which four are at
present on the market. They are made by secret formulas and the details of the method of
their manufacture are n'o t public. Directions for mixing these glues are furnished by the
manufacturers and should generally be followed by the user. The principal points to be
observed in the mixing of prepared casein glues are:
1. A thorough mixing of the dry glue from each or all containers before adding to the
water. This is advisable on account of the segregation of ingredients of different specific
gravities which may occur during hipment from the factory to the consuming plant. Sifting
is not advisable, as it may remove from the glue some essential component.
2. Proportions of glue and water should always be weighed, not measured.
3. The glue should be added slowly to the water accompanied by vi orous agitation in
order to avoid a lumpy mixture.
4. After the glue is well mixed into the water, the stirring hould continue more slowly
until all particles are thoroughly dissolved and the glue appears of a smooth, creamy
consistency.
5. The desired consistency of the glue should be attained during the mixing and nO attempt
should be made to thin the glue should it become too thick in use. It should be mixed only as
fa t as it is being used.
The proportions of dry glue and water should, in general, be as directed by the manufacturer. However, the exact proportions will vary with (1) different glues: (2) different
shipments of the same glue, and (3) the kind of work for which the glue is to be u ed. Only
average proportions can be stipulated by the manufacturer; and the operator, in order to obtain
satisfactory consistencies, may find it necessary at times to vary from the average proportions
specified.
TyPE OF MIXF..R.

The ordinary types of mixers u ed for animal and vegetable glues are not well adapted
to ca~ ein glues. The prime requi ites for a mixer for these glues are: (1) Rapid agitation and,
preferably, different speeds of the paddle; (2) a glue pot that can be readily cleaned-preferably one that can be detached from the machine it elf; and (3) a glue pot of metal that will not
corrode under the action of alkali. The mixing pot should not be of brass, copper, or aluminum,
as the alkali usually pre ent in casein glues will attack these metals. No provision need be
made for heating, a casein glues must not be heated. A mixer that has proved satisfactory
at the Forest Products Laboratory is a power cake-dough mixer of the type used by bakers.
(See Plate 1.) The machine has a double-acting paddle and may be operated at three different speeds. Some glue manufacturers have devised inexpensive machines which do good work
and which embody the essential points of thorough agitation and ease of cleaning the mixing
bowl.

APPLICATION OF GLUE.

Casein glue may be applied to the wood either by hand or with a machine spreader. In
applying by hand, a wire brush or a metal scraper gives good results. If the glue is to be
spread on irregular joints with a bri tle brush a omewhat thinner mixture may have to be
used. The ordinary corrugated roll type of machine spreader works well. Enough glue should
be spread to cover both surfaces of the joint and a small amount should squeeze out from the
joints when pressure is applied.
The working life of casein glues aries from a few to many hours. A glue of moderate
consi tency should have a life of at least four or five hours, and glues may be made which will
last for many hours. The fitness of a glue for u e should be judged by its consistency;
ordinarily, as long as it can be uniformly spread, a good glue will give good results. The time
that may elapse between the spreading of the glue upon the wood and the pressing will depend
upon everal factors, chief of which are: (1) The moisture content of the wood; (2) the consistency of the glue; (3) the kind of wood; (4) the quantity of glue applied, and (5) the
temperature of the wood and glue. The time should be correspondingly reduced if the wood
is of an open, porous nature and of a low moi ture content, or if a thin spread or a thick: heavy
glue is used. A high temperature causes the moi ture to disappear more rapidly from the
glue layer and al 0 hastens the setting of the glue. In general, the pressure should be applied
while the glue is yet in a wet condition, in order to obtain contact between the uncoated wood
and the glue layer. If the glue becomes too thick, poor contact will result. In most cases: if
pressure is applied within ten to fifteen minutes good re ults will be obtained. Under other
conditions a longer time may elapse.
PRESSURE.

Sufficient pressure should be applied to bring the layers of wood into close contact with
the glue. A pressure of from 75 to 100 pound per quare inch is u ually considered ample.
This will necessarily vary with the consi tency of the O'lue and the character of the material
being joined. Greater pressures are necessary for irregularly surfaced material and thick glue
mixtures than with the oppo ite conditions. The time under pres ure may vary from a halfhour to a much longer period. Good joints have been obtained by pressing for only one-half
hour. A longer period will probably give better results. "Where it is convenient retaining in
clamps over night is generally practiced.
After the material is remond from the pre. ,it hould preferably be allowed to condition
before being finished. The time required for conditioning will d pend upon the size of the
stock: the moisture content of the material before gluing, the condition under which it is
uniform moi ture content of approxiseasoned and the requirements of the fini hed product.
mately that de ired in the finished piece hould prevail in the material before it is put through
the finishing process.
STORAGE OF CASEIN GLUES.

Dry casein and casein glues will keep for a long time if stored under proper conditions.
When bought in large quantities they hoolcl be tored in a cool, dry place, as excessive
moisture and high temperatures cau e deterioration.
STRENGTH A D WATER-RESISTANCE.

Casein glues, when properly mixed and applied, have O'ood -trenO'th and water-re i t<'l,nt
properties. These qualities are well demonstrated by the tests impo ed on plywood manufactured for use in airplanes. To be accepted am pIes wero required to show no separation of
the plies after boiling in wl\ter for eight hours or oaking in cold water for ten days. For
shearing strength in plywood the requirement were at lea. t 150 ponnel per square inch, but
most of the plywood tested at the Forest Products Laboratory showed values considerably
higher than this minimum requirement. Te ted wet after several days' soaking, casein glues

GLUES USED IN AIRPLANE PARTS.

395

commonly have from 20 to 40 per cent of their dry plywood shear strength. If, however,
the glue is redried after being soaked, the original strength of the glue is very largely recovered.
As a joint glue, casein is as strong as the wood of practically all of our common species.
Tested on blocks of maple with the grain running in the same direction, shearing strengths
are commonly obtained ranalng from 2,000 to 2,500 pounds per square inch, with a large percentage of failures in the wood. The progress which is being made in developing new formulas
and improving the methods of manufacture is constantly increasing the strength and waterresistance which can reasonably be demanded of casein glues.

BLOOD ALBUMIN GLUES-THEIR MANUFACTURE, PREPARATION AND APPLICATION.
The u. e of blood albumin glue i comparatively new in thi country. Previous to our
entry into the war, a few manufacturing plant had their own secret formula and were u ing
them in the preparation of glue. But the demand for water-resi tant plywood for military
purpose, cau ed a marked increa e in the production of all kinds of waterproof glues, both
(;[t ein and blood albumin.
During the period of the war the Forest Products Laboratory
developed several formula for blood albUlnin glues and worked out a method of gluing Yery
thin veneer by a dry blood glue proce s.
WET GLUE PROCESS.

Prepared blood albumin glues are not off r d on the market, chiefly on account of the
in solubility of the albumin with age. They are, therefore, mixed at the time of u ing.
The <rlue may be made either from the fre h blood of slaughtered animal or from black
"oluble blood albumin obtained by proces ing the fre h blood. To make the u e of fre h blood
feasiblp. the supply mu t be readily acce ible to the place of manufacture, inasmuch as rapid
rlecoIDFosition takes place and renders it un ati factory for glue purpo e . Unless utilized
at once jt must therefore be treated with a pre enative or converted into a dried soluble form .
The dried soluble albumin is the form from which the <rlue is <renerally made, and is obtained
by subjecting the fresh blood to a proce for removing the fibrin and part of the red corpuscles
and then evaporating to dryne s at a temperature below the coagulating point of the albumin,
which is approximately 160 0 F.
decrea~e

PREPARATIO

OF GI:UE.

(F01'est Pl'oclucts Labot'Mory Method.)

In order to put the dried albumin into solution, it is neees ary to allow it to oak for some
time before stirring. It is advisable to add water at about room temperature to the albumin and
allow it to stand two hours or more before stirring. It . hould then be agitated until it i
of uniform con i teney. If coal' e particle of in olnble material occur, the mixture may be
t.rained through a screen of about 30 me hes to the inch. The dried albumin alway contain
some in oluble material and become more and more in. oluble with age.
A mixture of blood albumin and wa.ter makes a <r]ne with a con iderable degree of
adhesiveness, but it may be improved by tIle addition of other materials. The basic blood
albumin glue formula! for the wet glue procc. worked out at the Fore t Products Laboratory
consists of;
6 parts of black soluble blood albumin (90 per cmt solubility).
11 parts of water at about 80° F.
t part of ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) .
l part hydrated lime (from 2 to 3 per cent of the weight of albumin).

After the blood has been put in sol ntion , the ammonia is added while tin'ing the mixture
lowlv. The lime is then added in the form of a thick cream, and agitation should be continued
slow ly for a few minute. Care houll be e:x:cl'ci e 1 in the u. e of the lime, inasmuch as a. mall
excess will cau e the mixture to thi cken and become a jellylike ma s. The glue hould be of

moderate consistency when mixed and should be suitable for use for several hours. The exact
proportions of albumin and water may be varied to produce a glue of greater or less consistency
or to suit an albumin of different solubility than that specified.
APPLICATION OF GLUE.

The glue may be applied to the wood either with a bristle brush or with a glue spreader.
If the spreader is used it should be run only when actually coating the wood, as otherwise
the glue may become foamy.
PRESSING.

To set the glue, a minimum temperature of approximately 160 0 F . is necessary, which
causes the blood to coagulate. When thoroughly coagulated, the glue can not again be dissolved in water. The heat is conveniently applied to the 'vood by pressing between the hot
platens of a hydraulic press. In order to reduce the time required in the press and thus increase its capacity, it is customary to use !L tem.perature of from '600 to 220 0 F . Excessively
high temperature, however, turn the moisture in the glue and wood to team and are likely
to produce steam ·pockets or blisters between the plies of wood. A press ure of from 50 to 100
pounds per square inch is de: irable. The time required for pressing depends upon the
thickness of the plies, the number of panels in the press, and the temperature of the plates.
With a temperature of 212° F.· three minutes are sufficient for One three-ply panel with
ftr-inch face plies. The necessary length of time naturally increases with 'al1 increase in
thickness of material.
Blood albumin glue is used in plywood construction chiefly. It may, however, be used
for thicker material. For thick blocks it is necessary to apply pressure and maintJain it by
the use of retaining clamp, and then subject the material in a kiln or hot room to a temperature sufficient to set the glue.
Blood albumin glue is highly water-re -istant, slll'passing in this respect the present casein
glues. It retains its shearing strength to a remarkable degree after oaking or boiling, giving
from 50 to 75 per cent of the dry strength. I t is known to possess strength sufficient for joint
work, although, on account of the difriculty of setting the glue, it is generally considered impractical for this purpose.
PRECAUTIONS I N THE USE OF BLOOD ALBUMIN GLUE.

Several precautions should be observed in mixing and applying blood albumin glue.
1. Weigh out all constituents; do not measure them.
2. Add cold water to blood al bumin and do not heat mixture.
3. Do not stir blood until it has soaked fol' from one to two hours.
4. Avoid excessive stirring of the glue or agitation on the spreader, since this produces
foamy glue.
5. Load press and apply pressure quickly to prevent coagulating the blood before pressure
is secured.
6. Pressures ranging from 50 to 100 pounds per square inch are - dvisable, depending upon
a
the glue consistency, nature of wood, etc.
7. Excessively high temperatures of the platens of the pres produce steam, causing blisters.
A range of 200 to 212 0 F. is ad visable.
8. Panels should be left in the press until the heat has penekated so as to raise all parts
to at least 160° F.
9. Be careful not to use an excessive amount of hme or a strongly alkaline water.
DRY GLUE PROCE SS F OR THIN VENEER.

Glning thin veneer ranging from -h to Th of an inch into a very thin pallf~l has always
been extremely difficult. The principal causes of trouble have been penetration of glue through
the face plies and excessive swelling of the thin veneer due to the rapid absorption of water

398

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

from the wet glue, producing overlaps, curling, and wrinkling. These troubles have made the
manufacture of very thin plywood a very difficult and expen ive process. To overcome these
difficulties, a method of gluing very thin veneer was worked out at the Forest Products Laboratory in cooperation with the Bureau of Aircraft Production for the construction of experimental material, particularly for airplane wing covering.
A blood albumin glue was developed which when! dried could be used successfully to glue
veneer rh of an inch in thickness, or even thinner. The glue mixture used in this process varies
from the standard formula given above principally in the addition of a sub tance which makes
the glue hygroscopic, or capable of attracting and retaining moisture, sufficiently to give a
contact with wood.
P REPARATI ON OF GLUE LAYER.

The principal steps in the manufacture of the glue layer nre: (1) 1ixing the glue, (2)
coating on tissue paper or cloth, and (3) dryino-.
To obtain good results, the glue 'must be mixed thin and be free from lumps or undissolved
particles. Straining through a ieve is absolutely neces ary in this case.
The first machine used for coating this glue on the paper and drying was devised and
built at th~ Forest Products Laboratory. The proce was hter introduced into a commercial
paper coating plant, an improved form of tl1e machine for drying and coating was installed:
and the product can now be produced on a commercial basis.
A thin, porous tissue paper is used for coating and is placed in a machine geared to run
it through the glue bath at a rate of approximately 1 foot per minute. The tissue paper
passes over a rolier in the glue bath, and upward into a drying chamber to a worm roller upon
which there are strips of felt to prevent it from wrinkling. It then passes over a third roller
and through pinch roll to a fin al dry roll. Goth may be used as the medium upon which
the glue is dried and then be made to ser ve as one ply in panel construction.
GLUING PRO CESS.

In manufacturing plywood with the glue, sheets of ~t are placed between the plies of the
wood and pressed in a hot press. A pressure of from 150 to 200 pounds per square inch is
necessary in order to bring about good contact between the glue layer and the wood. If the
moisture of the veneer is low, the water-resistant propcrtie of the plywood may be increased
by a slight sprinkling or sponging of the veneer immediately before placing in the press.
ADVANTAGES OF THIS PROCESS.

This form of glue has advantages over the "et glue process, chief of which are:
1. Veneer as thin as one-one hundred and twenty-fifth of an inch may be glued up successfully.
2. Overlaps, wrinkling, open joints, etc., are overcome.
3. Gluing with the addition of little or no moisture overcomes cupping and twisting of
panels.
4. Drying of plywood is largely eliminated.
5. Subsequent trouble in checking of veneer in drying is eliminated.
6. Glue is always ready for use and keeps for a long time.
7. It can probably be used ]11ore rapidly and with less labor than the wet glue process.
8. No spreader is required.

VEGETABLE GLUE- MANUFAC'r URE AND USE.
The term vegetable glue is considered in the woodworking industries to mean glue made
from starch. There are other adhesives which are derived from vegetable sources, but these
are not commonly used in woodworking. Vegetable glue is usually made from cassava starch.

GLUES USED IN AIRPLANE PARTS.

399

which appears to be especially adapted for the purposes, but others such as corn starch or
potato starch are sometimes u ed alone or mixed with cassava tarch . Vegetable glue is not
used in airplane manufacture but is here discussed briefly as a matter of interest.
In one of the vegetable glues now on the market, the cassava starch is first treated to
r educe its water absorbing power. This is or hnarily accomplished by heating the starch with
an equal weight of water to 130 0 F ., stirring, and then adding strong sulphuric acid to the
mixture. Stirring is then continued for several hours after which the acid is neutralized with
an alkali and the mixture finally drained and dried. It is sold in this form as a starch base
for the preparation of vegetable glue by the addition of caustic soda. It is customary for
the manufacturer to sell the starch base and the cau tic on the basis of a definite price per
pound for" dry glue."
In preparing the glue for use, the starch is usually placed in a jacketed mixer so that it
can be heated and stirred when the water and caustic soda are added. About one hour's
stirring is necessary to complete the mixing. The glue can be prepared without heat if a
higher percentage of caustic is used.
The resulting product is a viscous, translucent material which is used cold and which will
keep for many days without deterioration. On account ot its stiff consistency mechanical
spread er s are required to apply the glue. It has not been found suitable, therefore, for irregularly shaped joints, which require hand spreading. It is pressed in cold presses in the same
manner as casein glue.
There are other prepared vegetable glues on the market which, up to the present time
have n ot been so widely used as the one ju t di cussed. ';rhese have various starches for their
bases and are manufactured by processes which are more or less secret. It is also possible to
make vegetable glue of good strength directly from the unprepared starch: with or without
the use of caustic soda or other chemicals.
This method and the methods which vary the amount of caustic used promise to be of
value in eliminating the objection to vegetable glue occasioned by staining, which often occurs
in l?;luing fancy furniture veneers, such as one-twenty-eighth inch birdseye maple and mahogany.
The reduction of the amount of alkali in the glue will reduce the danger of staining, but
will shorten the life. A vegetable glue made in this way without caustic will, however, remain
workable for 24 hours.
The status of the various vegetable glues is more or less involved in patent litigation, and
in using any of them the user should be thoroughly informed on this phase of the subjeot.

COMPARISON OF VARIOUS TYPES OF GLUE.
Each of the five types of glue, namely, animal, casein, vegetable, blood, and liquid, has its
own peculiarities, properties, and uses which influence its ~uitability for various purposes.
. Animal glue has been used so long and is so familiar to woodworkers that the valu"e of
ot.her glues is measured by comparing with animal glue. The principal desirable properties
of animal glue are the great strength and reliability of the higher grades, its free-flowing
consistency, and the fact that it does not cause staining of fancy veneers. So far no glue
has been found by the woodworking industry to be as suitable as animal glue for hand spreading Oil irregularly shaped joints, although a cheaper glue would be very desirable.
The
price of animal glue and the fact that it i not highly water resistant are the chief factor
which limit its use.
Oasein glue has been used commercia1ly for such a short time that its possibilities and
limitations are not well known. It has good strength, is used cold, and can be spread with a
brush, all of which are desirable properties. The property most featured, however, is its
high water resistance, which makes it suitable for gluing articles to be u ed under moist conditions. Thi property makes it a very desirable glue for special purpo es.

Among the disadvantages of casein glues are their tendency to stain thin veneer and the
relatively short working life of some kinds. They are also aid to be somewhat harder on tools
than animal and vegetable glues. This may be overcome possibly by u ing different steel
in the tools, or perhaps by altering formulas.
,
Casein glues by proper manipulation can be given certain pecial properties, as de ired.
Their water resistance, stl'ength, consi teney, spread, an 1 co t can be varied o,er wide rang
by one thoroughly familia.r with the subject. This i true to a much greater extent of the wet
than of the prepared casein glues. Already con iCierable reductions in co t have been made
in both kinds, but particularly in the wet glue. It , eem, quite probable that ca ein glues
will , ome day be serious competitors of vegetable glues On a price basi, without regard to
water resistance or other properties. Already they are entering the field of animal glue in
joint work. The fact that they can be made to pread readily by hand on irregular Joints
is ill their favor in this connection, in ad lition to their lower price.
V egetable glues haye found wide use in recent year chiefly on account of their cheapness.
Other valuable features are that they are used cdld, and that they remain in good working
condition and free from decompo ition for many day. They are extremely viscous, however,
and it is not practicable to spread them by hand. Their lack of water re i tance and the fact
that they usually cau e taining in thin fancy veneer are factors limiting their use.
Experimental work by manufacturer i constantly under way with the object of developing new and better grades of vegetable glue, and some progress has been made toward producing a stainless grade. The future dev810pments in this line depend to ome extent upon
deci ions in patent litigation.
Blood albumin glue has hown notably high resi tance to moi ture, e pecially in the boiling test. This make it particularly suitable for gluing ply,,'ood which is later to be softened
in hot water and molded. The production of molded plywood articles ha been very limited,
but it offer. a good field for future development.
Blood glue formulas can be altered 0 as to produce glues of variou propertie. It i.
possible to make some very cheap blood glues. suitable for the production of medium or cheap
grade articles. A very valuable form in whioh it can be made i the dry glue ti ue. Thi
promi es to be valuable for laying fancy veneer, ince by its u e it is po ible to eliminate
much of the trouble due to moisture chanO'es. The :fa.ctors limiting the u e of blood glue are
the expensive apparatus required, the relatively low production per pre ,and the fact that
'it is not very practical for gluing thick stock.
Liquid glues are, in general, similar in properties to animal glue.
ome brands are quite
equal in strength to good joint glues but other brand. are very weak and unreliable. Their
great advantage i that they come in prepared form, ready for immediate u e. Thi makes
them particularly suitable 'for patch work and mall O'luing jobs. The factors which limit
their u e aTe their high price, their lack of water re istance, and the difficulty the manufacturer
has in distinguishing between good brands and poor brand .
The following table gives in summarized form a comparison of the variou, glues. From
the table and the preceding di cussion it will be een that there is no glue which j superi.or

TESTING GLUES.
The tests used in judging glue vary with the typ~s.
tl'ength tests are suitable for all
types. Water-resistance te ts are made on casein and · blood glue . Additional tests made on
animal glues are with respect to viscosity, jelly strength, odor, keeping qualities, grease, foam,
and reaction to litmus. Chemical analysis i. generally of little value in judging glue.
STRE GTH.
BL OCK SHEAR TEST.

trength tests are made by gluing together two or more pieces of wood and noting the
pressure or pull required to break them apart. A number of method of making the test
pecimens and breaking them have been devi ed. The e depend to a certain extent upon the
character of work expected of the glue and the nature of the testing apparatus available. I n
the experiments at the Fore t Products Laboratory the simplest and mo t convenient method
found for testing the strength of the glue is a shear test.
Two blocks of selected hard maple, about 1 by 2t by 12 inches ill size, are glued together.
After the glue has aged sufficiently they are cut into hear specimen as hown in figure 1.
These are placed in a testing machine so that the base of the long half of the block rests on

a metal seat. (See fig. 2-C.). Pressure is then exerted on the short half, causing it to slide
past the long half at the glued joint. The pressure required to separate the blocks in this
way is me~sured and the percentage of the area of wood surface torn out by the glue estimated.
Ii the failure occurs entirely in the glue, a mea ure of the strength of the glued joint is
obtaine 1, but if the failure is entirely or partly in the wood, as frequently happens, the fnll
::,trength of the glue is not deyeloped, and the te,st may have to be repeated u ing stronger blocks.
The same method ha been used in ecuring data on the strength of wood in shear. Conequently when the strength of glne has been determined it can be compared with that of any
wood whose average shearing strength is known.
Four pecimens arc u ually broken and an average taken of their individual values. The
variation in the values can be kept at a minimum if the specimen are selected, prepared, and
teste'l under as nearly the same conditions as possible. A Yery important factor is the selection

of the wood. The pecies should be the one upon which it i propo ed to use the glue, or one
at least equally strong. Hard maple is the standard wood in us~ at the Forest Prodnct
Laboratory. Other woods of equal or greater strength which might be used arc sweet birch,
black locust, flowering dogTI'ood, canyon live oak, persimmon, big hellbark hickory, and we tern
yew.
It is a good pln.n to te t hide glue at three or four different dilution. FoUl" different sets
of specimens should therefore be prepared, using 2, 2l, 2t, and 2jf parts water, respectively,
to one part of glue. An excee lingly high-grade glue may work best at three to one, and there
arc Jaw grades which will giye best results with Ie s than two parts of water to one of glue.
Other types of glue ShOl1lcl al 0 be tested under condition which will permit them to develop
their full strength.
On account of the variable nature of wood and the imp'o ibility of doing perfect gluing,
the test is far from perfect as an absolute measure of the strength of a glue, but no other

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERO

AUTI S.

VISCOSITY.

The viscosity OT animal glue is determined by allowing a specified amount OT the glue at a
defini te temperature (usually 1-:1:0 0 F.) to flow through a , tandar 1 orifice. The time required
is a mea nre OT the vi co ity. The time required Tor water t.o flow through is taken as the
standard. In general, it is Tound that a glue with high vi. cosity i tronger than one OT low
vi~cosity and will take more "ater, although there are exception. Hide gh;es, as a rule, have
higher visco ities than oone O'lues. A number of viscosimeter of different hapes haye been
devised. In the glue manuTacturer's laboratory, where many te ts must be made each day,
an instrument mu t be u ed "'hich will gi\'e results quickly. Thi can be done with a pipette,
cnt off at one end, or with a traight glass tube contracted at one end. These instruments
are not always so arranged that the temperature of the glue within them can be controlled, and
Tor a number OT other rea ons they are not entirely accurate. For better control of temperature
:!nd greater accura.cy the Engler viscosimeter is often u ed. This is more complicated and
more expensive than the glass tubes, and also slower to operate, but it has the achantage, in
adtlition to greater accuracy, of being an instrument which is in general use for testing many
kind of material. The value obtained by its use are readily under tood by laboratory men
and can be readily checked. The instrument can be purchased standardized and ready for
nse.
JELL Y STRE GTH.

The term jelly strenoth refers to the firmnes or elasticity of the jelly formed by cooling
a glue solution of specified strength.
trong animal glues usually have high jelly strength.
There is no standard instrument for determining it, fwd no tandard unit for expre ing it. In
some laboratories the pressure required to break the surface of the jelly i measured. In
others the depth is obseryed to which a weight of special shape will sink. Someti)[leS the
jelly i cast in a conical shape and the weight required to pre the point of t.he cone a certain
distance is taken. The mith jelly tester, which is sometimes used, is 0 constructed a to
mea 'nre the pres ure required to expand a rubber diaphragm into the jelly to a certain volume.
This instrument is generally considered too inconvenient and slow, but it enables an accurate
comparison to be made and is used by some. testing laboratorie. A very commo'} test is the
finger test, in which the relative strength of two or more jellie i compared by pressing tJle
jelly with the fingers.
In making the jelly- trength test with any apparatus it i important that the condition
be very carefully controlled in order that ,comparable results may be obtained. The width
and depth of the glue jelly should be as great as practicable, in order to reduce to a minimum
the reinforcing effect of the bottom and ides of the ves. el upon the 1'C istance of the jelly to
indentation. Once a standard is adopted it should be adhered to iT comparatiYe re ults are
desired. The temperature OT the jelly when te ted is particularly important, as the relative
strength of a number of jellies is not always the same at different temperatures. In other
words, the jelly strength of different alue is not affected to the same extent by change in
temperature. The ideal way would be to cool and te t the jellies in a room con tantly maintained at the proper temperature. Thi is eldom practicable, however, and the jellies are
generally cooled in a refriO'erator and te ted in a warmer room. In such cases it is important
that the test be made a quickly a po ible aT tel' removing the jelly Trom the refrigerator, so
that the temperature will be practically the arne as it wa in the refrigerator. The strength
of the glue solution must al 0 be always the same, once a tandard is adopted. ,Yeakersolutions can be used for high-strength glues than for low- trength glues.
ODOR.

The odor of animal glue give some indication OT its ource and it ('ondition. Glue "hich
has an offensive odor is not con idered of the highest grade. The bad odor may be due to the
use of partly decomposed stock, or to decay of the glue itself. For high-grade work it i

GLUES USED IN AIRPLANE PARTS.

407

usually specified that the glue be sweet; that is, it must not have an offensive odor, which i
determined by smeJling a hot solution of the glue. The odor of different glues varies con iderahly, and it is difficult or impossible to expre s the different "hades." It is usually not
difficult, however, to determine whether or not the odor is clean, or, as it is commonly called,
sweet. The temperature and strength of solution are usually not specified.
I{EEPI G QUALITY.

The keeping quality of a glue is determined by allowing the jelly left from the jelly£tl'ength test to stand in the laboratory at room temperature for a number of days. The odor
and condition of the glue arc noted at intervals. Glue with good keeping qualities will stand
seYeral days without de,eloping an offensive odor, or showing any appearance of decompo. ition. A more rigorous tcst frequently adopted is to keep the solution in a thermo tat at
about 35° C. The glue hould remain sweet at least 4 hours under these conditions.
GREASE.

For joint work a small amount of grease in glne is not a seriou objection. Too much
grease, however, is objectionable, as grea e ha no adlle ive properties. For some clas es of
work, such as paper sizing~ even a ycry small amonnt of grea e can not be tolerated, as it gi ve
the paper an objectional appearance. ,Vhen glue is to be u ed in a spreader where foaming
is likely to occur, a mall amonnt of grea e is desirable, as it retards foaming. The grease
can be determined by chemical means if desired, but this is not necessary unless the exact
amount of grease must be determined. The common method of testing for grease is to mix
a little dye with the glue solution and paint it upon a piece of unsized white paper. If grease
is present, the painted treak will have a mottled or spotted appearance. If there is no grease:
the streak will be uniform.
FOAM.

Glue which foams badly is objectionable becau e air bubbles get into the joint and thus
rec1nce the area in which the glue i in contact with both faces. Foamy glue is especially undesirable for u e in gluing machines, a the o'lue i aO'itated much more than when it is used
by hand, and lhe danger of incorporating air bubbles i greater. The amount of foam is det('rmined by beating the glue solution for a pecifie 1 time with an egg beater or similar instrument and then noting the height to which the foam rises and the quickness with which it subsides. All laboratories do not make the test in exactly the arne way, but in any laboratory after
a method has once been adoptecl it sl10uld be tricUy followed. The foam test is generally
made on the olution used in the viscosity test.
REACTIO

TO LITMUS.

By it reaction to litmus a glue shows whether it is acid, alkaline, or neutral. The test
is made by dipping trip of red and blue litmus pllper in the glue solution remaining after
the viscosity test or some other te t, and noting the color change.
n acid glue turns blue litmus
red, an alkaline glue turns red litmu blue, and a neutral glue will not change the color of
either red or bllle litmus.
glue containing a light amount of acid is slig11tly preferable
to one which is neutral or alkaline, because it i not quite 0 favorabl a medium for the growth
of the organisms which cause decay.
COMPARI 0

WITH STA DARD SAMPLE.

It is apparent that, for the most part, the tests for animal glues give comparative rather
than absolute results. It is frequently difficult to compare the results of tests made by one
laboratory with tho e made by another, a the strength of solution, temperature, and manipulation so often are different. For this reason, it is considered that the most sati. factory method

40

ANNUAL REPOHT .NATIONAL AJ)VISOHY UOJ\fl\IlTTEill l'OR AERONAUTlUS.

of purchasing animal glues is to specify that they hall be equal to a standard sample furni. heel
the bidder to test in any way he see fit. The bidder should also be informed a to the methods
the purcha er intend to u e in testing glue llbmittc 1 to him as equal to the stan lard sample.
In using trength test it should be remcmbered that there is a. diifcrence betwecn tcstintr
the glue itself and testing the workmanship of the gluing. In the former a wood which will
not fail before the glue fails shou ld be used. 1£ the glue is too strono- the ideal testing wood
is hard to find, but hard maple appl'oache thc de, ircd standard. In the latter it is only
necessary to use the particular wood which will be glued in practi e 01' some other wood equally
trong. Then if the gluc proves stronger than the wood, the te t i satisfactory.
" Thile in somc cases equipment for tl' ngth tests would pay a large manufacturer, for
maIler plants the co t is prohibitive. A ystem of in. pection and certification for glues of
val'iou grade, uch as was operated in connection with the control of glue pUl'ehased for
aircraft Illanufacture during the war, would enable purcha. ers to ecure glue of known quality
without testing it themselvcs. Under,: thi sy tern glue was barreled: sealed, and certified at
the plants on the basi of actual test made at a central te ting laboratory by glue expert:.
This system might be duplicated during peace times by the organization of an inspection
ervice supported by an a ociation of the glnc-u . ing industrie . .

REPORT No . . 67.
SUPPLIES AND PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT WOODS.
By W. N.

SPARHAWK.

INTRODUCTORY.

The purpose of this report is to present in brief form such information as is available
regarding the supplies of the kinds of wood that have been used or seem likely to become
important in the construction of airplanes, and the amount of lumber of each species normally
put on the market each year. A general statement is given of the uses to which each kind of
wood is or may be put, but no attempt has been made to go into a technical di cussion of these
various uses.
The information herein contained has been compiled from a great many sources, including
principally published and unpublished reports by various members of the Forest Service.
Many of the figures given, particularly those relating to amounts of standing timber, are only
crude estimates, but until we ha"e a census of the forest resources of the country we shall have
to depend largely on guesswork. The figures on production of lumb er are taken from the
annual lumber census reports and may be relied upon. Estimates as to the proportions of the
total lumber production of different species that may be suitable for the manufacture of aircraft are necessarily very general, and are open to modification as methods of sawing or as
airplane specifications change.
It is believed that all the species used to any extent or approved for use in American aircraft are included. However, specifications in all probability will be changed as the industry
develops. Consequently, the use of many kinds of woods not now considered suitable may
eventually be allowed.
Statements regarding the uses of the different woods are included in order to give an idea
of the industries with which aircraft manufacturers will have to compete for their lumber
supplies. The figures published were obtained several years ago and hence may not exactly
represent present conditions, since the annual production of lumber of many of the species
has changed con.siderably in tlie interval.
The maps that accompany the text show by dots the approximate locations of the mills
that in 1917 produced the largest amounts of the lumber of most of the species covered
These maps, therefore, indicate in a general way the sources of commercial supplies of the
various species.

SUPPLIES AND PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT WOODS.

413

USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Spruce is the wood pal' excellence for the construction of airCl'Hft. It is ligb L and has
greater strength than other woods of similar weight. It. is stiff, has a considerable degree of
LOLlghnC s, and can be worked with ease. These properties have made it the most generally
u ed wood for wing beams and stru ts, and large quantities are employed for longerons, rib,
and plywood. Although there is no great difference in the strength properties of red, white,
and Sitka spruce, the latter species on account of its greater size and consequently its larger
proportion of clear lumber, is a more important source of aircraft material than the other two.
Because of thi and the large supplies of virgin timber still remaining, Sitka spruce will probably
for many years be a very important species in the aircraft industrr, notwithstnnding the fact
that the supply is so far away from centers of manufacture.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

itka spruce does not occur in pure stands over considerable areas, but grows in mixture
with Douglas fir, western hemlock, grand fir, western red cedar, and associated species. It
constitutes from 12 to 40 per cent, and occasionally an even greater proportion, of the stand
on much of the land where it is found, with an average of about 20 per cent. The trees reach
diameters of from 12 to 15 feet and heights up to 200 feet. Average mature trees are between
4 and 6 feet in diameter and contain from 10 to 15 thousand feet of lumber.
The total stand of Sitka spruce in Washington and Oregon is nearly 11 billion board feet,t
of which 6,100 million feet is in the four Washington counties named above, 4,375 million
feet in Oregon, and 475 million feet in other counties of western Washington. Except for
about 600 million feet on the Queniult Indian Reservation , 950 million feet on the Olympic
ational Forest, and 700 million feet of State timber, all of which is in Washington, and 300
million feet on the Siuslaw rational Forest, in Oregon, the spruce is privately owned, most of
it by large timber and logging companies.
Almost all of the Government timber is at present inaccessible. One-third of the privatelr
owned timber is scattered, inaccessible, or too Iowa grade to be important as a source of airplane material; 2! billion feet is in large bodies which can be reached only by extensive road
and railroad construction, and about 4 billion feet is fairly accessible to existing plants. The
greater part of the spruce forests is in the more easily logged portions of the region, on the
lowlands or in the lower foothills.
There is estimated to be from 15 to 18 billion feet of Sitka spruce in Alaska, practically
all on National Forests, but only about 1 billion feet of this is good enough in quality to yield
airplane lumber. There is also estimated to be about 29 billion feet in British Columbia,
probably not of the highest quality.
PRODUCTION OP LUMBER.

The average allnual cut of Sitka spruce lumber from 1913 to 1917 was 288 million board
feet, of which three-fourths was cut in Washington. In 1917, 14 mills reported cuts of more
than 10 million feet of spruce each, while about 30 mills cut from 1 to 10 million feet each.
Small mills play a very unimportant part in the production of Sitka spruce.
Under normal conditions spruce is logged with other species as it comes in the stand.
With the urgent demand for spruce during the war, however, the principle of selective logging
was de-veloped very generally, and special effort was made to get more spruce, and particuJarly higher-grade spruce, than would normally have been obtained. Because of the large
size of the timber and the heavy stands, steam logging is in general practice, although in the
selective logging animals were used to some extent. Motor trucks were used in addition to
the logging railroads and water transportation in bringing logs to the mills. Logging operations in the spruce region are carried on throughout the year. In this region much of the
timber is cut by logging companies that do not operate sawmills, but sell their logs to sawmills.
I

It is estimated that abou t 1,600 million board feet of the most accessible Sitka spruce has been cut since t his estimate was made.

414

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

• Most mills saw logs of all species; a few specialize on spruce. Mills in the spruce region have
a capacity considerably in excess of their normal total cut of aU species. Until the demand
for straight-grained material for airplanes developed during the past few years, no special
effort had been made to saw that kind of lumber. The urgent demand for airplane material
during the war led to improved methods of sawing, which made it possible to get the maximum
amount of straight-grained lumber out of the logs.
Of the 7 billion feet which will yield airplane lumber, it is estimated that 20 per cent will
grade No.1 logs, 40 per cent No.2, and 40 per cent o. 3. No.1 and o. 2 logs should cut
from 15 to 1 per cent of wing beam stock, and it is estimated that on the average the available mature spruce will yield between 10 and 15 per cent of wing-beam material. Of the total
stand of Sitka spruce, probably between 7 and 10 per cent will be suitable for wing beams.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Sitka spruce is used for about the same purposes as the other spruces. Forty per cent
of the cut of spruce lumber of the United States is normnlly used for construction and other
purposes without further manufactme. Sixty per cent is manufactmed into a largo variety
of products. Planing mill products consume 26 per cont. The box and crate industry, which
uses mostly the lower grades of lumber, takes 25 per cent, Musical instruments, which require
the best material, especially for piano sounding boards, use 2.2 per cent. Woodenware employs
2.1 per cent, and many other industries use smaller quantities.
Much of the high-grn,de Sitka spruce lumber is normally shipped east to the Central States,
and construction material of this species has very recently begun to enter Atlantic coast
markets in competition with eastern spruce. Shipments to foreign countries and to California
markets usually go by water. Eastern shipments have gone by rail, but under normal conditions Atlantic coast shipments will probably take the water route.
EASTERN SPRUCE.
RED SPRUCE (Picea rubens).

WHITE SPRUCE (Picea canadensis).

Picea canadensis is also known as cat spruce, bog spruce, and skunk spruce.
DISTRIBUTION.

Red spruce occurs from Prince Edward's Island, along the St. Lawrence Valley to central
New York and Massachusetts, and along the mountains as far south as South Carolina. White
spruce is found in northern ew England, the Lake States, the Black Hills of South Dakota,
and Montana, and extends far to the north in Canada and Alaska. In the United States, red
spruce is commercially important in northern Maine, ew Hampshire, and Vermont, and in
the southern Appalachians from West Virginia southward. White spruce is important chiefly
in the northern part of the Lake States.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Red and white spruce, wi"th Sitka spruce, are the ideal woods for the structmal parts of
aircraft, because in them lightness and ease of working are combined with great strength,
stiffness, nnd freedom from hidden defects. The three species do not greatly differ in strength
properties, but Sitka spruce reaches much larger sizes and, therefore, produces a larger proportion of clear lumber suitable for aircraft. Spruce is used for wing beams, ribs, struts,
longerons, plywood, and, indeed, for almost every wooden part of aircraft. Even though its
place ml1y be taken to some extent by other woods as the supply of virgin spruce dwindles,
it will undoubtedly continue to be a very importl1nt aircraft material so long as wood is used
for these purposes.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER:

Spruce occurs at medium or high elevations, I1nd in the northern part of its range it occupies lowlands also. In many places it forms extensive, pure or nearly pure, dense stands,
especially in the more mountainous parts of its rn.nge. In other places it is found in mixed

stands, with northern hn.rdwoods (birch, maple, beech, and ash), as well as balsam, hemlod:,
tamarack, arbor vitre, or even white and orway pines. Over large areas, spruce makes up
from half to three-fourths of the total stand. I n the southern Appalachians spruce is confined
to the higher mountains. The southern Appalachian section was not opened up until a comparatively recent date, but the spruce stands there are now being tapped by railroad and
most of the better-grade spruce will soon be accessible to mills. The spruce in the Jorthoast
must be tra~sported to the mills principally on drivable streams. Although the topography
of the region is such that the greater part of the lumber is accessible to such streams, still
certain large areas are somewhat out of the way.
The northea tern pruce doe not reach large ' ize. While diameters of from 2 to 3 feet
are not uncommon, a great many of the ·tree.:; in matUt"e stand have diameter between 12
and 1 inches. The outhern pruce averages con iderably larger than that of the North. It
is doubtful whether the Lake State pruce will be u cd to a large degree for airplane lumber.
The proportion of clear material produced is not large, and much of it i in hort lengths.
The total stand of spruce aw timbor in the ea tern United tate, excluding the Lake
tate, i approximately 14t billion board feet. Thi estimate doe not include trees Ie than
10 inche in diameter, and in ome tates doe not include tho e less than 12 inehe. Maine
ha approximately 7t billion feet, New Hampshire 2 billion, Vermont 200 million, Ne, York
betwe n 3~ and 4 billion, orth Carolina and Tennessee 950 million, West Virginia and irginia
390 million. Practically all of the old-growth pruce, a well as a large part of the econd
growth, i owned in large unit by land, lumber, or pulp companie .
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

During the years 1913 to 1917, the average annual cut of spruce lumber in the Northeast
and the outhern Appalachian wa a little Ie than 725 million board feet, of which 360 million
wa a\,ed in faine, 65 million in Vermont, 70 million in New Hamp 'hire, 25 million in Ma achu ett ,45 million in New York, 105 million in West Virginia, and 50 million in orth Carolina. While there icon iderable Iluctuation in the lumber cut from year to year, due partly
to labor and weather condition and partly to variation in the demand for pruce pulpwood,
the general trend indicate a reduction in the cut of spruce lumber.
For the year 1917,14 mills in 1aine. 5 in We t Virginia, 4 in North Carolina, and 1 each in
New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York reported cuts of between 5 and 25 million feet of
pruce, and 1 mill in Maine and 1 in We t Virginia reported more than 25 million feet. About
90 mills, most of them in Maine, ew Hampshire, and Vermont, cut between 500 thou ' ancI
and 5 million board feet. While mo t of the pruce mill cut lumber of other specie , spruce
forms the major part of the cut of most of the larger mills. Exi ting mills, if they were run
to capacity, could saw from three to five times a much pruce a they noW' cut.
In the ortheast, most of the logging i done in winter. Log are hauled out to drivabh'
stream by animal or team log hauler. In the outh operations are carried on throughout
the year. In thi region, both team and animal logging i carried on, and log are transported
to the mill by railroad. ~lo t operators cut pruce both for lumber and for pulp. Many of
them a'" only the be t log into lumber and let the small and inferior material go into pulp.
During the pn. ,t few years nearly all of the mill operators that cut any considerable quantity
of spruce lumber have become familiar with the chara ter of material requirecl for aircraft and
with the be ' t method of sawing it.
It i e timated that about 3.4 per cent of the pruce in Maine (12 iuehe in diameter and
upward) will be uitable for airplane con truction.
lightly more than 5 per cent of the ew
Hamp hire and Vermont spruce, a little Ie s than 5 per cent of that in Jew York, and from
to .2 per cenL of that in the southern mountain will be uitable for airplane ' . The ' figure
do not in all ca e repre ent what i being produced at the pre~ ent time, l:ecau. e 111 olne

FOR THE LUMBER.

Spruce lumber i u ed in large quantitie' for general con truction purposes and by indu tries manufacturing wooden products. A i stated in the chapter on itka spruce, the e industries use 60 per cent of the spruce lumber cut in the United State. High-grade spruce lumber
is in great demand for piano sounding board, for clapboard , and similar , u es, and in hOi:tel'
length for butter tub. Ea tern spruce is marketed mo tly in the orth and East and, consequently, doe not have to carry heavy transportation charges. On account of the higher
value of spruce tumpage in the Ea t, together with such other factor a~ the larger percentage
of upper grades sawed, from itka spruce, the spruce from the orthwe t i now competing
with the native lumber even on the ew England market.
Some 10 to 15 million feet of ea tern pruce lumber i, exported in normal times, chiefly
to the countries of western Europe.
DOUGLAS FIR.
(Pseudo{$uga taxifolia,)
Thi~

species is al

0 kll ()\vn

as red fir, yellow fir, Oregon pine, red pine, and Doug-las sprucf'.

DISTRIBUTIO .

Douglas fir occurs through most of the fore t from the Rocky i(ountains to the Pacific
coast, and from Mexico to central British Columbia. Only the stands west of the Cascade
Range, from northern California to British Columbia, contain any considerable proportion of
material suitable for aircraft construction, and, therefore, only the fir from this region is covered
in the following eli cu sian.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Dougla fir is a very atisfactory substitute for pruce in making wing beams, longeron ,
struts, and engine bcarers, and has been so used to a considerable extent. While somewhat
heayier than spruce, and more liable to check and shake during manufacture and in service,
in its trength propertie it is equal or superior to spruce of the same sizes. The enormous
supply a,~ailab le, the lalge proportion of high-grade material, and the high degree of development reached by the lumber industry in the Dougl.a.s fir region make this species an important
source of aiIplane material.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Dougla fir is the predominant tree through most of the for'est area west of the Cascade
Range in Oregon and Washington, and in many places it co,ers extensi,e areas practically
to the exclusion of other species. It form very heavy stands, averaging from 30 to 60 thousand
ho ard feet per acre over large tracts, and reache large izes. The trees in virgin stands anrage
from 3 to 6 feet in diameter and from 150 to 200 feet in height, and many arc much larger.
While the species grow from sea-level up to 6,000 feet elevation, the tand of better quality
that will yield a fair proportion of aircraft material are mo tly below 3,000 feet and offer no
obstacle to logging operations. Large bodies of tiInber are accessible to existing mills and
others will be opened up a they are needed. The stand of Douglas fir tiInber in the region
under con ideration is estimated at approximately 600 billion board feet, of which 60 per cent
i in Oregon and 40 per cent in Washington. Of this, 100 billion feet is on the national forests,
30 billion on State and Indian lands, and 470 billion in private holdings, for the most part in
large tracts.

•

PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The annual cut of Douglas fir lumber in the United States, from 1913 to 1917, inclusive,
ha averaged 5,150 million board feet , and is steadily increasing. The southern yellow pine
forests, which n:nv furuish the great bulk of the country's construction material, ha,e passed
the crest of their production, and the Douglas fir region will soon be called upon for an increasing
production to fill the gap. Ninety-five per cent of the cut comes from Oregon and Washington,

UPPLIES AND PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT WOODS.

and more than 0 per cent of thi , or approximately 4 billion feet, from west of the Cascades .
All but a comparatively in ignificant part of thi is produced by large, well-equipped, up-to-date
mills, of which there are about 180. Their rated capacity on a one-shift basis is between 9 and
10 billion board feet a year or, allowing for other species cut along with the fir, about double
their present output.
Because of the large sizes of the timber, steam logging and railroad hauls are the rule.
Logs are ordinarily cut from 32 to 40 feet long. Stands are generally cut clear of all merchantable material, taking all species as they come. Operations are continued throughout the year.
Many logging companies have no mill connections but sell their logs to sawmills.
Unfler normal conditions no particular effort is' made to saw out straight-grained lumber.
The demand for such material dming the past two years led to the development of methods
for producing it, and these will no doubt be continued and improved upon if the demand
continues.
Under present standards most of the airplane material will come from the grades No . 2
clear and better. The percentage of the cut in these grades varies with different tands, but
for the region averages about 20 per cent. It is estimated that half of this lumber will not be
suitable for aircraft, on account of low density, pitch pockets, and a little spiral grain. The
other half, or 10 per cent of the total cut of 4 billion feet, should be suitable for aircraft, and
probably 60 per cent of that, or 6 per cent of the total cut, will meet present standards for
wing beams.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Of the total cut of Douglas :fir lumber, approximately 45 per cent, including most of the
better-grade material, is fmther mallufactured. The greater part, 40 per cent of the cut,
goes into flooring, interior £nish, sash and doors, and other planing mill products. Between
15 and 20 per cent of all wood used for the e pmposc in the United States is Douglas fir. Of
the total cut, 1.8 per cent goe into tanks and silos, 1.7 per cent into cars, and 0.9 pOl' cent into
ships and boats. Considerable quantities are used for pumps and pipe, fmniture, boxe and
crates, fL'{tures, paving, roliers, agricultmal implements, and woodenware.
Douglas fir is being sold in increasing quantities in the eastorn United SLates. It has
for a number of years been exported in considerable quantities to South America, China, and
Australia, and to a very limited extent to European countries.

PORT ORFORD CEDAR.
(Charnflecypal'is lawsoniana.)

This species is also known as Lawson cypress, Oregon cedar, ancl white cedar.
DISTRIBUTION.

Stands of Port Orford cedar of commercial importance are confined to a trip from 20 to 25
miles wide along the Pacific coast in Coo and Curry Counties, Oreg. Scattel ed individuals are
reported as far south as the Klamath River and Mt. Shasta, in California.
USE I

AIRCRAFT.

While somewhat heav' er than Sitka pruce, Port Orford cedar is equal or supelior to pruce
in all its strength properties, and has been ucce sfully used as a substitute for spruce. in making
wing beams and for other uses to which spruce is adapted. While this species is satisfactory
for aircraft use, the limited supply and small annual output indicate that it will probably not
playa very important part in the future development of the airplane industry.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Port Orford cedar does not gro\v in pure stands; butis catterod through forests of Douglas
fir, hemlock, grand fir, and western red cedar. It usually comprises from 25 to 30 per cent of
the s tand. Trees of this pecies reach very large size. Practically all of the standing Port
Orford cedar is virgin timber, and fairly accessible to existing mills. The stand is estimated

at about 750 million feet, of which 250 mi.llion feet is on the Siskiyou National Forest, and the
remaining 500 million feet, about equally divided between Coos and Curry Counties, IS Prlvately o\vned. Most of this is in the hands of a small number of large firms.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The total cu t of POI t Orford cedar in 1917 was abou t 35 million board feet, which is probably
about the average ap-nual production. The bulk of it is cut by one firm and only foUl' mills cut
more than one million feet each. Cedar is ordinarily cut as it comes in the stand, and makes up
about 2 per cent of the total cut of the mill ",-hioh produce it. Existing plants, if run to full
capacity on a one-shift basi, could cut approximately 25 per cent more than they did in 1917.
Logging i by team, and log lengths of from 32 to 40 feet are commonly cut. During the
drive for wing-beam material for the war, awing method adapted to the maximum production
of straight-grained material were used; but, since traightness of grain is not one of the main
consideration in cutting lumber for most commercial uses, it is possible that no special effort
will be made to produce that kind of material in the future.
About 20 per cent of the cut falls in the clear grade (No .1 and No.2), and it is estimated that
60 per cent of this or 12 per cent of the total cut, i of airplane grade. 'rhe other 40 per cent
will be clisqualiiied. on account of low density, spiral grain, or other defects.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

The upper grades of Port Orford cedar are used for interior finish, caskets, and boat building. The lower grades go into general construction. Much of the output is normally used on
the Pacific coast, and some is exported to Japan.

FIR.
GRAND FIR (Abies grandis).
This species is also known as lowland white fir, white fir, Oregon white fir, and silver fir.

SILVER FIR (Abies amabilis).
This species is al

0

known as lovely fir, amabilis lir, red fir, red il vel' fir, and larch.
NOBLE FIR (Abies nobilis) .

This species is also known as larch, and red fir.

WHITE FIR (Abies concolor).
This species is also h."llown as California white fir, COlorado white fir, balsam, and silver fir.
DISTRIBUTION.

Grand fir occura along the Pacific coa t and along the Cascade range from Vancouver
Island to northern California, and extends into northern Idaho and northwestern Montana.
Silver fir occura on the upper slopes of the Cascade and Coast Ranges from Briti 'h Columbia
to central Oregon, and is mo t abundant in the Olympic :Mountains of Washington .
oble
fir also occura on the Coast Ranges of Washington and Oregon, and along the Cascades of northern
Oregon and southern Washington. The range 'Of white fir extend from the Rocky Mountains
of southern Colorado to northern Oregon, and southward through California to I ew Mexico,
Arizona, and northern Mexico. It is of large commercial imporLance only in the Sierra region
of California.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Grn.nd fir is somewhat heavier than pruce, but in strength compares favorably with it.
Silver fir is also slightly heavier than spruce, but practically equal to it in mo t of it strength
properties. Noble fir is lighter than pruce, and about as strong . White fir is a little lighter
than spruce, and almo t as strong, except in shock resistance. While the fir have not 0 far
been used to any extent in airplane con truction, at lea t the fir.:lt thre3 species named may
prove to be fairly satisfactory substitutes for spruce in making wing beam' and struts. As far
as present information howa, the other fira are not strong enough for such use. Because of
their light weight, however, the fira are suitable for core work in producing plywood.

SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

The firs usually occur in mixed coniferous forests, although in some situations they form
practically pure stand" over considerable areas. Associated species in the northwe t coast
region are Douglas fir, western hemlock, we tern red cedar, Sitka spruce. In the MontanaI daho region the stands include western white pine, Douglas fir, western red cedar, western
larch, western yellow pine, we tern hemlock. The white fir in the ierra region is as ociated
with western yellow, Jeffrey, and ugar pine, Dougla fir, red fir, incense cedar, and occasionally
with the b igtree. Granel fir occurs chiefly at low and medium elevations, and there it ean conveniently be logged along with Douglas fir and its other as ociate. Silver fir is a tree of the
higher lopes, and very little of it can be con idered. accessible under present conditions. The
ame is true, but to a somewhat les extent, of noble fir. White fir grows in rough mountain
country, and much of it is hard to get at. It is commonly taken when found on tract that are
being cut over primarily for other species.
The total stand of grand fir is estimated at about 13~- billion board feet, of which nearly
5 billion feet is in Washington, 4 billion feet in Oregon, and4t billion feet in Idaho and Montana.
Two-thirds of it is owne 1 by the Government, principally on National Fore ts; the re t is owned
by lumber and timber companies. It is estimated. that there is 35 billion feet of silver fiT, and
that 32 billion feet of it is in Wa hington, owned about half-and-half by the Government and
by private companies. Of the -± billion feet of noble fir, two-third s owned by the Government
and one-third by private concerns. Three billion feet of it i in Or gon. There is about 35
billion feet of white fir in Oalifornia, 5 billion feet in Oregon, and possibly H-billion feet scattered
in other States. About half of it i on the National Forests and the other half is in the hands of
large private owners.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The average annual cut of all specie classed as "white fir," which includes the four species
under discu sion, as well as red fir (Abies mrLgnijica and A. shastensis) and alpine fir CA. lasiocarpa) , was about 110 million feet a year up to 1916. Of this it is e timated that approximately
45 million feet each were white fir and geand fir, and between 5 and 10 million feet each nob le
fir and silver fir . With ri ing prices, which made it pos ible to log more of the fir, the eut 1'0 e
in 1916 to about 190 million feet, and slightly exce d d that amount in 1917. The cut of grand
fir is estimated to be now about 64 million feet, of which 53 million comes from northern Idaho
and adjacent part of Montana and Wa3hington; that of silver fir i judged to be about million
feet, all in Washington; that of noble fir, 6 million feet, cut by one firm; and that of white fir,
approximately 100 million feet, of which 87 million feet is cut in Oalifornia and 11 million feet
in Oregon.
The greater part of this lumber, probably at least 90 per cent of it, is prouueed by large
mills, which cut fir only incidentally as it come' in the run of logs. Thirty mills report cuts for
1917 of between 1 and 5 million feet of fir, and 11 report cut in excess of 5 million feet.
Steam logging is very general in th fir region, and nearly all operators use logging railroad's
I n the northwe t coa t region logs are cut long, while in the northern Idaho region and in the
Sierras 16-foot lengths are the rule.
Since, with the exception of the noble fir, the logs make only relatively low-grade material,
little care is used at most mill in sawing them up. The percentage 'of clear material that can
be obtained varies rather widely in diffeecnt localities. The best available estimates indicate
that about 1 per cent of the white fir and grand fir, from 1 to 2 per cent of the silver fir, and
10 per cent of the noble fir will be suitable for airplane con truction.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

The great bulk of the fir lumber produced is u ed in construction work without further manufacture. The be t material i made into 1l00ring, sash, doors, interior finish, and helving.
The box and crate industry uses a small percentage of the output. While some fir lumber may
reach ea tern markets along with shipment of Douglas fir and western pine, by far the greater
par t of it is used in the West.

WHITE PINE.
(Pinns strobus.)
This specie is also known as Weymouth pine, northern pine, spruce pine, -and soft pine.

DISTRIBUTION.

White pine occur hom Newfoundland to Lake Winnipeg, and southward tlu'ougb the
Lake taLe, the ew England State, and in the Appalachians as far south as northern Georgia.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Although somewhat softer, Ie s shoek-resi tant, n.nd Ie
tiff than pruce, white pine
comparatively strong and light, uniform in _Lructure, ea y to dry and work, and stays in
place well. It is a fairly atisfactory substitute for pruce in making wing beams and for
other u e , and ha been so employed. Because of its lightne ,it make excellent core for
plywood.
orway (or red) pine (Pinu.s J'esino8CL), which is ut and marketed along with white
pine in the northern par~ of it" range, may also be u'ed a a spruce ub titute.
The remaining supply of virgin white pine is Llst disappearing; and, ince very li. ttle wing
beam material can ho ohtain"cl from s cond-O'rowth, thi , pecies will not long continue to be
an important airplan wood, except possibly for plywood.

IS

SUPPLY OF

Tl~BER.

Pure stands of \\"hite pine or mL"'\:ed tand of white and Norway pille sLiIl cover exten ive
areas in Minnesota. Ol,her area arc covered with mixed stands of pille, hardwoods, and hemlock, in which pine mayor may not be the predominant species. There are practically no virgin
pine stands left in the orthea t. Most of the pine in this region is now in small tract, many
of which are pure pine, while other. contain pille in variou mixture. Whilo the e tands are
frequently heavT, they contain very little clear material uitable for wing beams and imilar
uses. The virgin white pine in the Appalachian region i now chiefly in the South, from We t
Virginia southward. In this region it occur 'enttered through mixe 1 hardwood and hemlock
stands, and its average quality is not 0 high as i that of tho pine in the Lake State. Virgin
white pine averages 3 feet and more in diameter and 100 feet or more in height.
Only the supply of virgin timber need be con ' idered in discu ing wood suitable for aircraft
con truetion . This is roughly e timated at 12 billion board feet, of which 10 billion feet
(25 per cent of it Norway pine) is in the Lak States (chiefly in northern Minn ota), and
2 billion feot in the southern Appalachians. It is practically all on large tract owned by land
and lumber companies, and most of it is acce sible and available for existing mills.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

From 1913 to 1917, the average annual cut of white pine lumber wa nearly 2,100 million
feet, as again t an average of about 3,500 million feet during 1907 to 1912. The white pine
cut has been teaclily falling off for a number of yeUl as the sUlJplies of virgin timber have
become more nearly exhausted. It may be expected to continue to fall rapidly until the few
b illion feet left in Minnc ota are cut, after which a fairly con tant amount will be cut each
year from econd-grow' Lh ·stands.
Of the presen t CUL, a Ii ttle moro than half, or ahou t 1,200 million feet, comes from virgin
timber. About 900 million feet of I,hi i cut ill Minnesota, 210 million feet in Wi con in and
Michigan, and 75 million feet in Lhe southern Appalachians.
mall amount of virgin white
pine are cut in )1aine, Pennsylyallia, and New York. Ninety per cent of the virgin pine is
sawed by large mill..;, it mnnher of which cut 25 million feet or more·a year. Fourteen mill in
Minne ota and one in 'Yi..;consin reported cuts of thi sizo in 1917. These mills cut white and
Norway pine principnlly; Homo of them cut litLlo of any other species . In the outh, white
pine usually forms only a minor part of the cut of the mil13 that produce it. 'lhe econdgrowth pine of the Northeast i.' almost entirely cut by small tationary or portable mills,

A"NNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Some 350 operators in New England reported cuts in 1917 of between 500 thousand and
5 million feet, and only six reported cuts in excess of 5 million feet. Lake States mills have a
total capacity far in excess of their present output.
Logging in the Lake States pine region is mostly done in the winter, since surface conditions favor hauling when the ground is frozen. In the Appalachians logging is carried on
throughout the year. Most operators use animals, and cut few logs more than 16 feet long,
except of Jorway pine, which is frequently cut 18 and 20 feet long. The larger operators use
logging railroads.
Straight grain is a characteristic of white pine, and little eiIort is necessary to produce
material of that quality. It is estimated that 85 per cent of the material graded B Select and
better, or from 50 to 60 per cent of that graded D Select and better, will be suitable for airplane use. In the Lake States region about 14 per cent of the cut from old stands is D and
better, which would make from 7 to 81 per cent of the cut uitable for aircraft, if it were cut
in the proper sizes. In the Appalachians probably not more than 4 per cent of the cut would
be satisfactory.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

White pine, once the mo t widely used lumber in the United States for general construction
and other purposes, ha come to be more and more a wood for special uses, and only a very small
part of the cut is now used in its rough form. Half of the total cut goes into planing mill
products-sash, doors, blinds, siding, and similar articles, which require fairly high-grade
material. Nearly two-fifths is used by the box and crate industry, which, at least until the
last few years, u ed white pine more than any other wood. This industry uses chiefly low-grade
lumber. Considerable quantities of upper-grade white pine are u ed not only in ship and boat
building, but also for patterns, tanks, silos, furniture, and musical instruments. Upper grades
of Norway pine go into planing mill products, ladders, and cars.
White pine reaches a omewhat extended market; but, now that it is largely used by manufacturing indu tries, a great part of it is sold in the orthern and Eastern States. Facilities
for shipping are good, for most of the large mill are so located as to be able to transport their
output either by rail or by water.

WESTERN WIDTE PINE.
(Pinus monticola.)
TIllS species is also known as Idaho white pine, mountain pine, and silver pine.
DISTRIBUTION.

While the range of this species extends from southern British Columbia to western Montana
and outh along the Cascades and Sierras to central California, the region of its great commercial importance is in the Panhandle of Idaho and in adjacent parts of Montana and Washington.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

While slightly heavier than spruce, western white pine compares very well with it in all
strength properties except hardness. It makes a fairly satisfactory substitute for spruce for
wing beams and similar uses. It is also a good material for plywood cores because of its comparative lightne s. However, becau e of the relatively small percentage of the cut that is
available for airplane use, and because of the abundance of other woods suitable for the same
purpose, it is likely that western white pine under normal conditions will not be a very important source of material for the manufacture of aircraft.
SUPPL Y OF TIMBER.

Western white pine occasionally appears in pure or almost pure stands on limited areas,
but is more commonly found in mixture with western hemlock, western red cedar, western
larch, Douglas fir, grand fir, and lodgepole pine. In the region of its best development it occurs
at low and middle elevations, but in the coast region it is more a tree of the higher elevations,

where, however, it u ually constitutes only a very in ignificant proportion of the tand. The
tree reache a fairly large ize, with diameters frequently in excc s of 5 feet and heights from
100 to 150 feet at maturity. Larger sizes are not uncommon.
Logging conditions are not equally favorable 'everywhere in the white-pine territory, and a
large portion of the stand a yet i somewhat inaccessible, but it i estimated that from 15 to 20
per cent of the stand is available to existing mill .
The total stand ha been estimated at about 29 billion fe t, of which 61 billion feet i on
ational Forest, 3 billion feet is owned by the tates (principally Idaho), and 19z billion feet is
held by private interests, mostly in large holding of lumber companies or railroads. The greater
part of tbi is in northern Idaho and the northea t corner of Wa hington.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The average annual cut of we tern white pine between 1913 and 1917 was 350 million feet,
and the gen ral tend n y indicate a sligbt in rca e, except that abnormal condition during the
pa t two year have caused production to fall off. About 80 per cent of the cut is normally
made in Idaho, and 1.5 per cent in Wa hington.
inety per cent of the total is cut by large,
well-equipped mills, nearly all of which saw as ociated species a ' well as pine. About 30 per
cent of their total cut i " ,hite pine. The capacity of existing mills would 'allow nearly double
'
the pre ent cut.
The logging sea OIl usually la ts from six to eight months, being limited by the deep snows
which fall in much of the region. Log are usually cut 16 feet or less in length. The majority
of operator use animal logging, but a few large concern log by sLeam. Log are either drive~
Lo the mill or carried by rail. While no attempt is usually made Lo saw Lraight-grained material, most of the larger operators have become familiar with Lhe requirements for airplane
material during the war, and can aw it if it is in demand.
Most of the airplane material will come from the clear grades of lumber. The grading
rules allow a few small knots in the e grades, and probably these defect , together with crooked
grain and low density, would cau e the rejection of a small proportion of the upper-grade material. It i e timated that an average of from 2 to 3 per cenL of the cut of western white pine
would be uitable for aircraft con truction,
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

We tern white pine is u ed for about the arne purpo es a ea tern white pine, The uppergrade lumber is largely employed for ash, dOOI , interior finish, and similar purposes, and is
marketed to a large extent in the agricultural tates to the east. A little of it goes as far as
the Atlantic coast. Lower-grade lumber i used in building and for boxes and crates, for which
there is a good demand in the white-pine section and adjacent regions.

SUGAR PINE.
(Pinus lambertiana.)

DISTRIBUTION.

Sugar pine occurs on the Coa t ranges of outhern Oregon and northern California and
along the outhem Ca cade , the west slopes of the Sierras, and in lower California. It i mo t
abundant and of best development in the Sierras.
USE I

AIRCRAFT.

Sugar pine i low in hock rosis,ting ability and in the quality of stiffness, and it varies
widely in it strength properties. It i not, therefore, well adapted for wing beams or other
parts of aircraft where great trength i a requisite. Being oft, light, and easy to work, it may
be used in less critical parts, particularly for plywood cores. Since, however, it is likely that
pruce and other species cut for vving hp,ams will yif'lrl fl, lflrge ' upply of suitable mall-sized
material, ugar pine may never become very important for airplane u os.

SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Sugar pine never occurs in oxten ive pure stands, but is scattered through stands of western yellow pine, Jeffrey pine, white fir, incense cedar, and Douglas fir, where it usually comprises from 10 to 30 per cent of the tand. It grows at medium elevations in rolling or rough
country and, for the mo t part, where it can be logged 'without great difficulty. Still much
of the sugar pine country is as yet undeveloped, and probably less than one-third of the total
stand is available to existing mill. Sugar pine reaches large sizes; diameters of 6 feet or more
are common, with heights up to 200 feet or even more.
The stand of this species has been estimated at 45 billion feet, of which 33 billion feet is
in California and 12 billion feet in Oregon. The figure for Oregon is probably very much
too high. Fourteen billion fcet in California and 2 billion feet in Oregon is on ational
Forests. Most of' the remainder is privately owned, principally by large lumber companies,
the Southern Pacific Raih'oad, and large lando·wners.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

From 1913 to 1917 tlte average annual cut of sugar pine lumber was 140 million feet,
which r epresents nearly 30 per cent increase over the cut between 1907 and 1912. All but an
insignificant amount of thi lumber was cut in California, and 90 per cent of it by large mills.
In 1917, 6 mill reported the production of more than 10 million feet of sugar pine each, and
11 other mill reported cuts of between 1 and 10 million feet. Sugar pine make up one-fourth
of the total cut of the mill which aw it. Most of these mills cut hiefly western yellow pine,
with some white .61', Douglas fir, and incense cedar. The mill capacity of the region is more
than twice the present cut. The large available supply of timber indicates that the cut may
be expected to increase for some time.
Logs are cut between May and November, deep snow in the mountains making winter
logging impracticable. Sugar pine is cut as it comes with its associated species. Steam logging is generally practiced by the larger companies, but animals are also used to a considerable
extent. All large operators use logging railroads. Logs are generally cut from 10 to 20 feet
long.
It is estimated that 9 per cent of the total cut of sugar pine falls in the two upper grades,
No.1 and No.2 clear, and 4 per cent in o. 3 clear. Material suitable for airplane use will
come chiefly from these grades, together with a small amount of short material from No.1
shop. Probably from 9 to 10 per cent of the total cut will be suitable for aircraft.
MARKETS AND USES FOR LUMBER.

Approximately half the cut of sugar pine lumber is normally used as it comes from the
sawmill for construction and similar purpo es. The other half is further manufactured into
a variety of forms, chief among which are planing-mill products ( ash, doors, blinds, finish),
which use 26 per cent of the total cu t, and boxes and crates, which use 20 per cent of the total.
Small quantities, chiefly high-grade material, go into musical instruments, furniture, patterns,
woodenware, fixtures, and boats.
A considerable part of the high-grade material finds its way to eastern markets The
lower grades of lumber and the box material are used principally in California, where the
demand for such material is great.
WESTERN HEMLOCK.
(Tsuga heterophylla.)

This species is also known as Prince Albert's fir and AlMka pine.
DISTRIBUTION.

Western hemlock occurs from 'northwestern Montana and northern Idaho to Alaska, and
south along the Cascades and Coa t ranges to central California. It is of commercial importallce in the Paci.6c coast region from southern Oregon to Ala::3ka.

USE I

AIRCRAFT.

Heavier than spruce, but lighter than Douglas fir, western hemlock is low in shock re::li tance. It might be used as a substitute for spruce, but it is probable that it will be so u ed
only to a limited extent so long as supplies of better material are available. It makes a satisfactory core for plywood, and may sometimes be of considerable importance for this purpose,
since the upply is large and the wood comparatively cheap.
SUPPLY. OF TIMBER.

Along the Pacific coast, we tern hemlock is usually the predominant species in mixed
stands with spruce, western red cedar, Douglas fir, and grand fir. It is sometimes found in
pure stands along the coast of Washington and Oregon, while in Alaska extensive pure
stands of hemlock or mi..'md stand of hemlock and Sitka spruce are common. Along the Cascades it forms a much smaller proportion of the stand. The timber is nearly all in dense virgin
stands, on both lowlands and higher slopes. Trees reach large size, with diameters at maturity
of from 6 to 10 feet and heights up to 200 feet.
The stand in Washington, Oregon, and Alaska is estimated at about 132 billion board feet,
of which approximately 57 billion feet is privately owned, chiefly by large timber companies,
and 75 billion feet by the public, mostly on National Forests. Thirty-three billion feet is in Oregon,
54 billion feet in Washington, and 45 billion feet in Alaska.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The average annual cut of western hemlock lumber averaged 325 million feet for the year::;
1913 to 1917.
early 85 per cent of it was produced in Washington and most ::Jf the rest in
Oregon. In 1917, 10 mills, all in Washington, reported cuts of more than 10 million feet of
hemlock. Forty-four mills in Wa hington, 19 in Oregon, 1 in California, and 1 in Idaho reported
cuts of between 1 and 10 million feet. Hemlock is considered an inferior species by most operators, and is cut along with other species only incidentally. In selecting logging chances, areas
which run heavily to hemlock are usually passed by for those with larger proportions of the
more valuable species. Hemlock makes up about 11 per cent of the cut of the mills reporting
it. If they operated to capacity (one shift) and cut hemlock in the same proportion as at
present, existing mills could increase their production more than 50 per cent. Production
will probably tend to increase for many years as the lumber industry of the Northwest de,elops.
Logging is carried on for about 10 months in the year. Steam logging is the rule, with
railroad or, in some cases, water tran portation. Logs are cut from 32 to 40 feet long. Operators make no effort to saw for straightness of grain, but attempt to get a maximum amount
of clear material.
The best available et:ltimates indicate that not more than 3 per cent of the cut is in the two
upper grades of hemlock, which include mo t of the material suitable for airplanes. It is estimated that not more than one-third of the material in the e grade, or 1 per cent of the total
lumber cut, could be used for thi purpose.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

The bulk of hemlock lumber (including eastern and we tern species) is used in the rough for
construction work, and only about 30 per cent is further manufactured. Most of this goe., into
planing-mill products, which consume 17 per cent of the cut, and into boxes and crates, which u e
8 per cent. Most of the upper-grade western hemlock is used for fini h, flooring, and siding.
Probably the greater part of it,
Western hemlock is marketed along with Douglas fir.
being comparatively low-grade material, is used on the Pacific coast and in contiguous territory.
REDWOOD.
(Seq uoia semperl'irens.)

Bigtree (Seqtwia giganteo ) is included with th e redwood in the discussion in this chapter.

DISTRIBUTION.

The redwood occurs in the coast belt of northern California from just below San Francisco
Bay to the Coos Bay district of southern Oregon. The bulk of it is in Del Norte, Humboldt ,

and Mendocino Counties, Calif. The bigtree, which is also sold as redwood, occurs on the
west slope of the central Sierras over \"ery limited areas.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Redwood is variable in its properties and is apt to be brash; hence it is probably not suitable
as a substitute for spruce in aircraft. It is, howe\"er, an excellent wood for plywood core on
account of its lightness and the ea e with which it can be worked.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Redwood forms pure forests in northern California; farther south it occurs as gro\'"es scattered among other species. The trees reach enormous size, with very heavy stands. Redwood
is s!,\ldom found above 3,000 feet elevation. Bigtree reaches even larger sizes than does redwood. It usually occurs in groves mixed with such other species as western yellow pine, sugar
pine, white fir, and incense cedar, and is found at elevations between 5,000 and 8,400 feet.
The total stand of redwood is estimated at about 73 billion board feet, practically all of
which is in the hands of a few large private owners.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The annual cut of redwood lumber has not fluctuated widely for the past 10 or 15 years
from the average of approximately 500 million board feet. Almost the entire cut is produced
by 34 mills, which handle redwood almost exclusively. The capacity of these mills is rated at
about 850 million feet a year. In 1917, 18 mills reported cuts of from 5 to 25 million feet, 4 mills
from 25 to 75 million feet, and 1 mill in excess of 75 million feet. Two of these mills were in
the coast region below San Francisco Bay, one was in the Sierra bigtree region, and the rest
were on the northwest coast.
Logging operations are carried on throughout the year in the redwood belt. All operators
use steam equipment and logging railroads. Most of the upper-grade lumber is now cut in
16-foot lengths. While no particular effort is made to saw straight-grained material, redwood
is natUlally straight grained and the proportion of such material produced is large.
About 50 per cent of the cut is in the Clear and Sap Clear grades, and it i estimated that,
after allowing for grain, pitch pockets, shake, and other defects, at least half of this, or 25 per
cent of the cut, will be suitable for aircraft construction.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Three-fourths of the redwood lumber produced by sawmills is u ed, without further manu·facture, for general construction and for railroad ties. Planing-mill products take ] 9 per cent
of the cut, wood pipe about 2 per cent, and tanks and silos almost as much. A great number
of industries use smaller amounts.
A large proportion of the lumber and ties, as well as of the manufactured products, is used
in California. Redwood is sold, however, in all parts of the United States and is shipped to a
number of foreign countries, especially to those on the Pacific.

BALD CYPRESS.
(Taxodium distichum.)
This specie is also known as cypress, swamp cypress, southern cypress, black cypress, red cypress, and white
cypress.
DISTRIBUTION.

Cypress occurs in the Atlantic and Gulf coastal regions from outhern De"Iaware to Texas, and
along the bottom lands of the Mi si ippi and its tributaries to sou them lliinoi and Indiana. I tis
best developed and most abundant in outhern Loui iana (Atchafalaya region) and in Florida.

An average of lightly over a billion feet of cypres lumber wa cut each year from 1913 to
of the average cut durinO' the six preceding
years. The cut is now about stationary, but will decline in a few years as the virgin upp1y becomes more nearly exhau ted. More than half of the total cut now comes from the Atchafalaya
Basin of outhem Louisiana, and about 20 per .cent is cut in Florida. Eighty pcr cent of the total
i cut by Orne 205 large mill' .
Tr e are usually girdled for some months before they are felled, in order to make the logs
lighter. Logs are commonly cut 16 feet or shorter, and are gotten together by means of steam
skidder mounted on "pull bott ts. " They are then towed to the mill .

being shipped.
Because of the difficulties in the way of the u e of this specie, particularly with regard to
its great variability in density, it i not easy to e'timate how much is suitable for aircraft.
Such material will come largely from the grade~ known a tank (1 per cent of the average cut),
A ( per cent), B (7 per cent), and factory elects (5 per cent). A rough estimate places the
possible airplane tock at ahout 12 per cent of the total cut.

MARKETS AND U ES FOR THE LUMBER.

One-third of the cypre lumber cut i used a it comes from the mill for construction and
similar purpo es. One-half of the cut i used for planing-mill products-sa h, door, fini h,
molding, and similar u es. Four per cent i used for boxe and crates, 31 per cent for tanks
and silos, 2 per cent for casket and coffin, I! per cent each fo'r laundry appliance and machine
construction. Smaller quantities are applied to many other u es.
Cypre s lumber is very widely sold in the United States, and con iderable quanti tie go to
foreign countrie .

AXKUAL REPORT NATIO.rTAL ADnSORY COMMITTEE FOR

AEItO~AUTICS.

White a h i common in all States east of the Mis issippi, except in the Coa tal Pl ain region,
but is not very important in the lower Mis is ippi valley. Biltmore a hi chiefly in 'renne see,
Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. Green ash is of greatest commercial importance in the bottoml and of the Mi issippi and it tributaries and in the Coa tal Plain region. Pumpkin ash is of
importance only in southeastern }.Iis ouri and eastern JorLh Carolina. Oregon a h i of orne
importance in Washington and Oregon. Black ash is chiefly found in the Lake tate and in
northern New England and ew York Blue a h i of orne imporlance in Ken tuc ky, Tenne ee,
I ndiana, Ohio, and southern Missouri.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

The a hes known commercially a " white ash" include both white a h and green ash, a well
as the Biltmore and blue a he. All of the e are \"ery de irable wood for use in aircrafL. VI hite
ash has great strength and tiITne- , bend ' \"ery well, and i u uilly fairly straight grained. It
is used very exten ively for longeron , bent work on wing and fuselage, landing sluds, and
other parts of the framework of aircraft, and ha been u eel to some extent for propeller.
econel-growth a h is mol' likely to have the requi ite den ity and hence is frequently considered
more desirable than old-growth a h for tho e u es in which great toughne s is required. Oregon
ash i probably a good a whiLe ash. Black a hi not so stia as the other, but is \"ery tough
and i excellent [or bending. It houlcl make good plywood. Pumpkin a h is lighter and weaker
than the other ashes, and therefore, i not de u'able for airplane construction.
orthern-grown
white a h ha been considered more ' atisfactory than t.hat [rom the outh, probably on account
of the fact that a large part of the a h now cut in Lhe :North is from second-growth tand, and
becau e the northern a h has on the a\"erag a higher den ity than thaL from the outh, whi hi
largely green a h. In the ouLh brash material of the better pecie of ash i u uaily sold under
the name of pumpkin as,h .
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Ash occurs in mi..'\:ed hardwood tands and eldom forms more than a mall proportion of the
mixture. White ash in the orth ordinarily make up from 5 to 10 per cent of old stands, and
sometime from 20 to 50 per cent of econd-growth tan l over limited ·area. Green ash is a
more important component of most of the tand in which it occurs, and i frequently the predominant specie in certain parts, Black a h makes up from 1 to 10 per cent of the stands
where it grow, and over lunited area i occa ionally the predominant tree,
Except in northern New England and e"- York and in norLhern Michigan and Wisconsin,
most of the northern and ea tern ash i · from econd-growth Land, and a large part of it is from
woodlots. The Southern ash, as well a" orne of that in the Lake State, still com to a large
extent from exton ive tract ill \"irgin forest . The old-growth upply i rapicUy dwindling, and
a l arger and larger proportion of the cut i coming from econd growth.
There are no available e. timate of the tand of ash by pecie, The total of all specie i
estimated at about 10~ billion board feet, of which about n billion feet is in .r ew Engl and and
ew York, 1~ billion feet in the Lake tates, 11 billion feet in the central woodlot region, 11
billion feet in the outhern Appalac hians, and 4~ billion feet in the lower Mi issippi valley and
Gulf region,
In about the order named, the, State with the large t tanels are : Arkansas, Louisiana!}
Missouri, Ohio, Texa , Mississippi, Michigan, Tennessee, Georgia, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maine,
and New York. These States have about three-fourths of all the ash in the United States.
T

PRODUCTIO

OF LUMBER.

The average cut of ash lumber during the five years 1913 to 1917 wa ju Lunder 200 million
feet a year, or about 50 million feet les than the average annual cut during the preceding ix
years. The lumber cut is teadily declining and may be expected to do so until it reache a figure
approximately equal to the annual increa e of econcl-growth tands.

SUPPLIES AND PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT WOODS.

439

Besides the ash cut in the :form of lumber, much of the handle and vehicle stock is cut
directly from logs or bolts, from 25 to 35 million feet i u cd for slack cooperage, and 2 or 3
million feet is made into veneer. In normal times from 5 to 7 million :feet of ash logs is cut for
export.
Arkan as and Loui iana arc now tho loading tato in the production of a h, and together
they produce one-fourth of all the a h lumbor cut in tho United tate. Following them, come
Wisconsin, Tennes 'ee, Indiana, Missi ippi, New York, and Michigan. The e tate together
produce about 60 per cont of the total. Twenty-nine mill reported cuts in 1917 of more than
one million :feet of ash. Two of these were in northern New England, 3 in Indiana, 5 in the
,outhern coa tal region, and the rest in the lower Mis is ippi valley. A h lumber is cut in smaller
amounts by a very large number of both largo and small mills.
Logging in most of the ash regions is carried. on throughout the year, except that in the
river bottoms it is usually interrupted by high-water periods. Steam logging is ometimes
employed, but animal logging is used by most operator.;;. Logs are carried to the mills by rafts,
railroads, team, or motor trucks, according to the region in which th opera.tions are conducted .
Log arc u ually cut in lengths of 16 feot or less. Many operator.;; u e considerable care to saw
traight-grainedlumber, particularly :from the white a hes, since so many of the uses to which
high-grade ash i put require traightness of grain.
Tho strongost matorial i usually sa,vod from within '1 inche of. the center of the trees;
consequently, tree of comparatively small diameters may produce as much airplane material
a trees 'from virgin tand. The proportion of high-grade material produced varies, of course,
with the size of the trees a' well a with the locality where they grow. From second-growth
white a h lands, trees under 10 inches in diameter yield no firt and seconds, and about 50
per cent No . 1 common; troos 20 inches in diameter yield over 40 per cent firsts and seconds,
~tnd about 35 per cent No.1 common. A suming the average diameters to be from 14 to 16
inche , an average proportion i about 25 per cent firsts and second, and 42 per cent o. 1
common.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Practically all of the a h lumber cut is further manufactured before it reaches the consumer.
Approximately 22 per cent is used for handles, especially those for pades, shovel, hoes, rakes,
and fork, :for which long, tiff, tough, traight-grained piece are required. More ash than any
other wood except hickory is used for hanclle. Twenty per cent of the 'cut is used for butter
tub. This material i nearly all green and black a h, and compl'i' es short, clear lengths cut
from low-grade logs. Fifteen per cent is used in vehicle manufactme, for such parts as pole ,
tongues, axle, and felloes, which require tough white or green ash of high quality, and for
bodies, which are made of larger piece of old-growth ash. Planing-mill product take 7 per
cent of the cut, much of it black a h. Refrigerator" and kitchen cabinets (mo tly black ash),
furniture (mostly black a ' h), car con truction (all pecies) each take about 6 per cent of the cut.
Agricultmal implements and oar' (both of which require high-grade white and gree\l ash) each
take about 3 pCI' cent. Athletic good, mu ical instrument, fixture, hames, and many other
product that call for a good grade of material take smaller amount.
A hi eiLher manuiactured into the finished product near where it is cut or is hipped to the
everal
centers of the wood-manufacturing industry in the J orthern and Eastern State.
million feet of log is normally exported to Europe each year and several million Ieet of lumber
goes Lo Europe and to South America.

BASSWOOD.
(Tilia americana.)

This sppc ies is al'o called lind en, linn, and whitewood. Downy bu swood ( '1'. pubtsccns) and while buxswood
( T. helerophylla) should p"obably also be grouped with the common ba.~swood. Data are not available, however ,
with I'e ped to the strength of these ~pe('ies.
DISTRIBUTIO .

Ba 'swood occurs from northern ~ ew Brullswick to Lake 'Winnipeg, outll to Virginia,
northern Georgia and ...\.labama, eltstortl Te:'ul.s, and as fHl' we 1, as eastern DakoLa, Kansas, and
Oklahoma. It reaches its large '1, ize in the low~r Ohio River bottom lands, but is more abundant northward.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Basswood is light in weight but low in strength; consequently it is noL a good ubstitute
for pruce. It is, however, one of the best \yoods in abiliLy to take nails without splitting.
and i excellent for webl:> of wing rib and for plywood core generally. It is al 0 u cd for thin
flooring plank.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Tlu'ough most of it , range bas wood is found in mixture with oth I' hardwoods. In the
N orLh it frequently is the. predominating species in the tand, and sometime form pure stnneL
over limited areas. :'lature tree frequently reach diameLers of from 3 to 4 feet ancI height
of more Lhan ] 00 feet. While much of the btl swood is in situaLion in which logging can be
done with little difficulty, a considerable part of it is in localitie as yet unde'Veloped and is not
available to exi 'Ling mills.
The Lotal tami is estimated at approximaLely 9 billion board feet, of which 0 per cent i
in Wi 'consin, Michigan , :1OOne ota, Iowa, New York, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Yerm nt,
in the order named. There i about H billion feet in New England and Now York, 5 billion
feet in the Lakes tate, It billion feet in the southern Appalachian, and 1 billion feet in the
central wood-lot region.
Much of the virgin tand, which i in northel'll New England, the Lake States, anti the
southern Appalachian, i owned by large land and lumber companies. Out ide of the e tlu'e('
regions, IDO t of tho ba wood is in small holding.
PRODUCTIO

OF LUMBER.

For the five-year period 1913 to 1917, the average annual cut of basswood lumber was
approximately 250 million board feeL, which was nearly 100 million feel, les ' Lhan the average
cut during the preceding six year'. The general tendency indicates a teady docline a the acce' ible virgin upplio become more nearly exhausted. One-third of the total i cut in northern 'Wi. con in, one-fifth in Michigan, and one-eighth in West Yirginia. These tate, with N w
York, cut about three-fourth'> of Lh total.
From 95 to 99 per cent of Lhe ba wood cuL in ~1ichigan and Wi consin and the larger
part of thaL cut in We t Virginia is produced hy large mills. In 1917, 32 mill reported cuts
of more than a million feet of basswood, and about 1 0 reporLed cut of between 200 thou and
and a million feet. Ba wood wa cut along with a 'Variety of other woods by all of the e
mills and formed only a minor part of the total output of most of them.
Logging operation proceed the year round in mo t of the basswood I' gion. Animals are
quite geD rally used, although a few companies log with steam. The large operation in the
Lake Lates and in the outh arc railroad operation. Logs arc commonly cut 16 feet or Ie
in lenoth.. 1\1ill cut for grade, but not particularly for straight grain.
omo 10 million fee
, of ba wood veneer i cut each year.
It i e3timated that from 16 to 20 per cent of the basswood cut will O'racle firsts ancI econds.
and that from 22 to 25 per cent will grade No.1 common. The proportion will probably run a
little higher in the outh, where the trees arc ' omewhat larger.
iatQrial uitable f r aircraft
con truction will come from these grades, principally from the first,

('onsmller. Twenty-three per cellt of the toLal goe into the box industry; ] 6 per cent int
finish and other planing mill products; 16 pel' cent into woodenware; 9 pel' cent into furniture;
6 per cent (more than of any other one p cies) into trunk and vali os; 51 per cent into picLure frames and molding; 3 per cent into musical in Lruments : 21 per cent into toy. .\.

Ba swood lumber i marketed chiefly in the rcO'ioll of wood-manufacturing indu trie , that
is, the orth Atlantic and North Central State.
BEECH.
(Fagus alropunicclL. )

DISTRIBUTION.

Beech occurs from N w Brunswick to northern V\'isconsin anel south to eastern Te'Xa
and we.' tcrn Florida. It reacho it he,;t development in the Northern States, the lo\ver Ohio
Valley and the Appalachian ' .
USE I

AIRCRAFT.

Having strength propertie vcry similar to those of maple and birch, it makes a fairly
satisfactory propeller ,,'ood wherc requirement are not too exacting, and W::IS used for this
purpose to orne extent in Europe. It is a1 0 a satisfactory maleriul for ply\YoorJ. Because
of the compal'ativeiy lu,l'ge ftnd aece ,;ible supplies of the timber fairly do e to center of consumption, and be ause of tlH' c1ieapne of the material; beech may be of con icleralle importanGe in
the future of airplane manufa<.:turing.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Beech sometimes forms nearly pure stand over limitecl area , but, is usually foulld in mixture with other f'pecios, such as birch, sugar maple, bas 'wooel, and hemlock. In such mixtures
it is frequently the predominant pecies. Mature trees 3 feet or more in diameter are common.
Most of the beech is in fairly accessible regions, in situation which ofrer no serious difficulty
in logging.
While accurate data as to the stand of beech timber arc lackillg, rough estimates indicate
that there is from 20 1025 billion board feet il~1.he United States. Senll-eighths of it is in the
following State, which arc named in the orcler of their importance as beech States: Michigan,
ew York, Maine, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio , New Hampshire, Vermont, Penns)T
h"ania, and
IV est Virginia. It is e Limated that there is n.bout ? billion feet in New England and ~ ew York,
4 billion feet in Michigan and \Vi consin, .5 1>i11ion fe et in the. onthem Appalachian., and 4
billion feet in the eenLral wo od lot region.
Much of the virgin timher in the Lake StaLes, northern New England and Kew York, and
the Appalaehian is held by large lumber companies or land companie. A large flmounl of
beech, however, is found on small holdings, pnrticularly in the Central States.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The averu.ge aTlnual cut of heech lumber in the nited States from 1913 to 1() 17, wa. 3fiO
million feet. For the six years preYlous it was 410 million feet per year.
The production of
beech lumber is, therefore, slowly declining and may be eKpect.ed to do so until it reaches the
point where it does not exceed the increase in second-growth stands. Michigan pruduces 20
pe4' cent of the toLal, followed by Indiana, W cst Virginia, Pennsylvania, Tew York, Ohio, and
Kentucky. The first, five State named produ co nearly three-foutns of the total.
Beech is cut, along with associated haruwo ds or hardwoods and conifers, by a largo nllmher
of both large and small mills. Probably the larger pr~por lion of the higll-grade material is
produced by fairly Jarge mills, each of "hieh cuts several hundred thousand Jeet of heech.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL AVYI ORY COl\L\IITTEE Fon AERONAUTICS .

There are only about a dozen mill that cut more than 2.} million feet of beech apiece. Horse
logging is the rule in the beech tenitory, although a few htrge operators use steam. Both animal
and railroad transportation are used, and, where roads arc good, motor truck are coming into
u'e to carry logs to the mill. Logging operations are carried on during most of the year.
In the Lake State~, approximatcly 13 per cent of the cut will grade fir. ts and seconds, and
23 per cent Xo. 1 common. Possibly the Ohio yalley and Appalachian timber may run a littIe
better. lot, is estimated that from 5 to 10 per cent of Hr is and seeonas can be cut into quartersawed slock suitable [or propeller.;;.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

About 65 per cent of the beech lumber produced is further manufactured. Of this amount,
13.5 per cent is made into planillg mill products ; 11.2 per cent into furniture and chairs; 3.9
per cent into handle; 3.3 per cent into woodenware; 2 per cent into laundry appliance, and
1.5 per cent into bru. he. Le ser quantities are utilized for vehicles, agricultural implement,
musical in truments, spool ancI bobbin, tops, and many other products. The box and crate
industry uses 1 .3 pel' cent.
.
On the whole, beech lumber is generally sold quite ncar the place where it is produced, mce
much of the beoch region is also the section o[ woodworking industries.

BIRCH.
SWEET BIRCII (Betula l el'i(l) .
Thi . pecies is al '0 known

a~

black birch, cherry birch , and mahogany birch .

YELLOW DlRCil (B etula lutea).
This species is also known as silver birch , swamp bircb, and gray birch.
DISTRIBUTION.

The range of sweet birch extends from Newfoundland to western Ontario, central Iowa,
southern lllinois, and south along the Appalachian Mountains to Florida. While most abundant
in the North, it reaches its largest size on the western slopes of the southern Appalachians.
Yellow birch occurs from Newfoundland to northern New England, northern Minnesota, and
south along the Appalachians to Tennessee and North Carolina. It is most abundant and of
larges t size in northern New England and New York, and in northern 'Michigan and Wisconsin.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Birch of these two species is quite heavy, hard, stiff, and resistant to wear, of uniform
texture, and takes a fine finish. It, therefore, makes satisfactory propellers except where the
requirements are exceptionally exacting. It has been used for propellers in se,eral countries.
Birch plywood is widely used in the manufacture of aircraft. Because of its resistance to
wear, it stiITnc s, and easo of bending, it i especially good for face ply where thinness is essential.
On account of the fairly large and accessible supplies of birch timber located at no great
distance from the ceuters of manufu,ct,ure, birch will probably continuo to be a very important
wood in the aircraft industry.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

While birch is frequently found in pure or almost pure stands of second growth over small
areas, it seldom so occurs in virgin stands, but is mi..'l:ed with other hardwoods and conifers,
among which sugar maple, becch, basswood, hemlock, spruce, and pine arc important. Mature
sweet birch trees run from 2 to 3 feet in diameter and from 70 to 0 feet in height, while yellow
birch averages a little larger.
:Much of the virgin birch in northern ew England and in the Appalachian region is still
somewllat distant from sawmill plants. The birch region of Wisconsin and the adjacent part of
.
upper t1:ichigan is the most fully developed at present.
Estimates of the total stand of birch are very unsatisfactory, and no attempt is made to
distinguish the species. The best available figure for all the birches together is approximately

AL REPORT

19 billion board feet.

ATlONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONA15TIC .

Tbis includes several species other than the two under discussion, but

the proportion of these (principally paper birch and river birch) is relatively small.

The States

having the large t stands of birch are, in the order named: laine, Wisconsin, ew York, richigan, 1innesota, Vermont, ew Hampshire, which together have about 90 per cent of the total.
It is estimated that there is in New England and Jew York 10 billion feet, in the Lake States
billion feet, and in the southern Appalachians 1 billion feet.
The greater part of the old-growth birch is owned by lumber companics or byland-investment companies, in large or fairly large units.
PROD

TIO

OF LUMBER.

The average annual cut of birch lumber in the United tates between 1913 and 1917 was
440 million board feet. This is a little in exce s of the average cut during the preceding six
years. In other words, the production of birch is yet on the increase, and the present rate of
output may be expected to be maintained for some years to come. Half of the total is cut in
northern ,Visconsin, and two-thirds in Wisconsin and :Michigan too-ether. After these, the
important producing tates arc: Vermont, Maine, ,,,"cst Virginia, and ew York. . These six
States report more than 90 per cent of the total cut. It is estimated that 5 per cent of the
birch cut in Wisconsin and Michigan is yellow birch, and mo~t of the remainder is sweet. birch.
This proportion is doubtle s approximately correct for the other States named.
'While birch i cut by a large number of small milis, by far the greater proportion is cut by
large mills. In northern ~Iinne ota 97 pOl' cent of the total i produced by mills which cut in
exce s of a million board foet each, and 99 per cent of the northern Michigan output is cut by
mills of that cla s. About 22 mills in \Yi consin and Michigan and 6 in Jew England and ew
York report the production of more than 3 million feet of birch caeh. Birch is cut along with other
species as it comes in the stand. Horse logging is the rule, although some of the larger operators use team. The large t producers run railroad operations. Logging in the birch region is
carried on during most of the yeur. Birch lumber is ordinarily plain sawed and the largest and
best logs are sayed for veneer.
Tnder normal conditions, from 25 to 30 million feet a year
i used for this purpose. The big mills both in the North and in the Appalachian region usc
considerable care in grading their lumber.
It is estimated that 12 per cent of the cut will grade fu'sts and sQconds, inches or ·widrr,
and that pos ibly 3t per cent will be suitable for propellers. Fir l and seconds make up 14 or
15 per cent of tbe total output in the Lake tates, and No.1 common about 25 per cent.
MARKETS A D USES FOR THE LUMBER.

PracLically the entire cut of birch i further mlLnufactured. Planing-mill products, including finish, sa h and doors, and imihlr products, take 2 per cent of it. Furniture including
chairs, takes 17.7 per cent and u es a larg l' quantity of birch than of any other wood except oak, .
maple, and reel gum. The pool and bobbin industry uses 6.9 per cent of the birch cut, a quantity greater than that of all other wood combined. Of all birch cut, 6.1 per cent goes into
woodenware and noveltie ; 3.2 per cent into fixtur~; 3 per cent into vehicle; 2.7 per cent into
musical instruments; 2.1 per cent into handles; 1.7 into dowels; and 1.6 per cent into boot and
hoe findings. Many other indu tnes use smaller amounts. The box and crate industry,
wruch probably uses the greater part of the low-grade lumber as well as some of rugher grades,
absorbs 1 .9 per cei1t of the total.
The greater part o[ the output of birch lumber is sold and used in regions fairly close to the
places wbere it is produced.
BLACK CHERRY.
( Prunus serotina ).

DISTRIBUTION.

Black herry occurs from ova cotia to Dakota south to Florida and Arizona, and along
the mountain to outh America. It wa formerly abundant and uf con iderable commercial
importance in the Appalachian region from We t Virginia to Alabama, but i nowhere abundant
now.

SUPPLm

AND PRODUCTION OJ!' AIRCRAFT WOODS .

447

USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Cherry wood is strong, fairly hard, straight grained, works well, and takes a fine fini h,
consequently it i an excellent propeller wood. It is also good for plywood facing. The upply i so small, however, that this species can 'probably never be of great imporLance to the airplane indu try.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Available e tim ate of the supply of tanding black cherry Limber are only rough gue .'e
based on the amount known to exist in it few 10caliLie ' . There is upposed to be between 400
and 500 million feet all tog ther. Cherry u ually occur scattered a' single trees in mixed hard\\-ood forests and along road and fence. It i e timated that about 100 million feet i in ~ ew
England and New York, 200 million in the outhem Appalachians, and 100 million in the central woodlot region. Probably there is more cherry' left in IV e t Virginia than in any other
' State. ~ ew York, Penn ylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Kentuck.,are also supposed to have con 'iderabl quantities. A few large yirgin tracts in the mountains
still contain considerable amounts of cheny, but hy far the greater part of the supply is in the
hands of a multitude of mall owner.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The average annual 'ut of black cheny lumber in recent year' has been less than 10 m.illion
board feet, and it i teadily decrea ing. We t Virginia cuts the mo t. Other tate~ that
produce con iderabl quanti tic are: Pennsylvania, Ne"- York, North Carolina, Indiana, 'fenne see, Michigan, Ohio, and Yirginia. About 20 'tates in all report ome eheny cut.
Cherry form oulya very small part of the cut of most of the mill that a\\' it. It is cut by a
large number of both large and small mills, very few of which cut large quantities.
It i e timated that from 15 to 25 per cent of the cut grades first and second, mo t of which
would be suitable for propeller.
USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Cherry i a valuable cabinet wood, and practically the entire cut i furLber manufactured.
Eighteen per cent goe into fixtures. Seventeen pel' cent goes into priniing material (backing)
this indu try u ing more cherry than any other five wooels combined. Car con tI'uction u e for
Eill h 16 per cent of the cherry lumber cut. Fourteen per cent goe into planing-mill product :
6 per cent into proie sional and scientific instruments; 5t per cent into furniture; 5 per cent into
handles; 4 pel' cent into bl'u he
Musical instruments, clocks, boat, fancy boxes, and pattern

elm occurs from outhern Newfoundland to the ea tern base of the Rocky fountain and south
to Texas and Florida. Commercially it is most important in }fichigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, and
the lower Mississippi Valley.
lippery elm ha almost the Same range as white elm, but does
not extend quite so far north or outh. Wing elm occurs in the Atlantic coast region from southern Virginia to Florida, and in the lower lississippi and tributary yalleys from onthern Illinois
to Texa. Cedar elm occurs from ~fissis ippi through Louisiana, onthem Arkansas, and most
of the wooded part of Texa .
USE I

AIRCRAFT.

Elm i lightly heavier than ash and rather low in stiffness hut Yery tough and hock retanto It steam bends very well and may be ub iituied for ash in longerons and for similar
usc. It i al 0 u ed for other bent work, such as landing skids and flying-boat ·' keels. Cork
elm ha been approyed [or propeller. 'Yhiie elm is u ed for bent plywood.
Indi,~idual piece of slippery and white elm of the arne density as cork elm haye tho same
properties; therefore, the pecies is a less importa,nt con ideration than the density. Slipper.,'
elm is on the average lighter than cork elm, and white elm is lighter and less stiff. All of the
elm require care in drying because of their tendency to 'mrp and to twi t.
The up ply of cork elm being very limited, this species prohably l:as no future as a propeller wood. On the other hand, the supply of all the elm taken together is ('omparatiwJ~'
large and acce sible, and growth is rapid; therefore, elm for bent work and plywood may he
u ed in inc rea ing quanti tie .
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Elm grows scattered in mixed stands with other hardwood, and docs not form pure
tands. It is a very common and widely di tribnted field and roadside tree. White elm reaches
diameters of 6 feet or more at maturity. Cork elm occasionn,lly reaches di<1meter of 3 feet, while
lippery elm and cedar elm are somewhat smaller, and wing elm is rarely 2 feet in diameter.
Fore t-grown cork elm are frequently free of branche for 60 feet from the ground.
Such estimate a arc availa'~le of Lhe total tand of elm do not eparate the species. It is
judged that there is about 16 billion feet of elm standing. The tates with the Jargest supplies
of elm are, in the order named: Arkan as, Mi souri, Michigan, Louisiana, Missi sippi. and Wi'cousin. These ix States have two-lhirds of the total tand. In New England and New York

from one-fourth to one-third of the elm cut in Wi con in, 5 per cent of that cut in lower Michigan, and 20 per cent of that cut in upper Michigan is cork elm. There i probably about 300
million feet of cork el~ standing in the eState , which haye nearly all of the supply of this pecies that i commercially important. While most of the remaining forest-grown elm, and probably practically all of the fore ·t-grown cork elm i. in large holding oW'ned by land and lumber
companie , a large part o[ the total stand or elm is held by small owners. Much of it, especially
in the lower Missi. sippi region, is on land that \\~ill be cleared for agriculture.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

During the rears 1\)13 to 1917 the average annual cut of elm lumber was about 215 million
feet, which is 60 million feet less than the average cut during the preceding six years. The cut
is gradually but quite steadily decreasing. Wisconsin and Michigan together pI'o~luce one-half
of the total; following them come Indiana, Arkansas, Ohio, and Missouri. 'l'hesv six States
report more than three-fourths of the total. Twenty mills in the North (Minnesota, Wisconsin,
1Iichigan, Indiana) reported cuts of elm for 1917 in excess of 1 million fect; fifteen in the lower
Miss:ssippi valley reported similar cuts. From 15 to 20 million feet of elm veneer, not included
in the lumb r cut, is also produced each year, besides about 150 million feet of slack cooperage
material. The annual production of cork elm lumber is about 131 million feet, of which 10
million feet is cut in Wisconsin, nearly all in hawano, Langln.de, and Forest Counties, and 31
million feet in Michigan. About half the elm cut in the three Wiscopsin counties named is cork

elm. Elm lumber forms only a minor part of the total cut of the larger mills reporting, as few , if
eny, of them make any special effort to get elm except as they happen upon it in the course of
logo-jng.
Practically all elm logs are plain sawed. From 1 to 20 per cent of the cork elm cut gra les
firsts and s c0ncls, admitting "\vidths as narrow as 4 inches, and from 24 t.o 30 I er c nt grade
No.1 common. The total amount of plain-sawed, straight grained, clear cork elm, suitable for
propellers, that can b obtained from the present annual cut, it is estimated, will not exceed about
200 thousand board feet. This is only about 1~ per cent of the total cut. It is probable, however, that a much larger proportion possibly from 15 to 20 per cent, will be suitable for ot.her
part.s of aircrafL. Because of the larger average size of the logs, an even greater part of the cut
of white elm may be available for those uses to which this speci s is adapted, incltteling tIl('
making of veneers . .A comparatiwly small percentage of it will be of sufiicient densitr to mflke
longeron stock.
MARKETS AND

•

SES FOR THE LUMBER.

At least 90 per cent of the elm lumber cut is further manufactured before it reaches the consumer. Twenty-sL-"': per cent goes into boxes and crates; 14 per cent into furniture (principall)T
chairs, for which more elm is us 3d than any other wood except maple and b(>cch); 12i per cent
into vehicles; 61 per cent int musical instruments ; 5 per cent into refrigerators and kitchen
cabinets; 3 per ent into agricultural impl ments; and 2~ pel" cent into trunks (especiaU)- slats).
maller quantities are us"d for a great ,-ariety of products.
This wooel is practically all used in the Northern and Eastern taLes, and the industries which
take the largest amounts of elm are llsually located fairly close to the sources of supply. ~\..
great deal of the cooperage maLerial is manufacLured into finished products in the outh,
near the places where iL is cut.
A large part of the cork elm produced is usc 1 in vehi les, for hubs, bows, parts of the running gear, automobile bodies, logging-wheel spokes, sleigh runners, and carriage-wheel rims.
ome is used for chair rockers, stepladders, laddpr rungs, plow handles, scythp snaths. and
many other articles.

COUj\rrTTm~

FOR AERONAUTICS.

USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Wood of the first four species named above has been suggested a a possible ub titute
for a h in 10nO'eron , since it is tough and strong, though heavier than a h.
0 far as known,
hickory has not been used for longerons. It i used to some extent for Ia.nding skids. The
other species arc less shock resistant and con iderably inferior to the e four.
SUPPL Y OF TIMBER.

Hickory usually oc urs scattered singly or in groups through mixed hardwood fore ts
at low and medium elevations. Over limited areas it i frequently the predominant specie.
While it is fairly common throuO'hout mest of its range except in the hiO'her mountains, it
is mo t abundant and of be t quality in the rich bottom land of the 1i sissippi and Ohio Rivers
and their tributaries. In thi region, as well as in the southern Applachians, there are still
large supplies of virgin timber. In the rest of the country most of the hickory is second growth,
which, however, is considered to be fully as desirable as old-growth timber.
The total stand of hickory can only be gues cd at. The best available estimate places
it at about 16 billion board feet, of which 3 billion feet is in the central woodlot region, 2t billion feet in the southern Appalachians, 2~ billion feet in the Atlantic and Gulf coa tal region,
and 7 billion feet in the lower Mi issippi Valley region. The States with the largest supplies
of hickory are, in about the follow'ing order: Arkansas, fis ouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, North
Carolina, Louisiana, Missis ippi, Alabama, and West Virginia. The e nine tates have about
two-third of the total stand.
The standing hickory i in the posse sion of a considerable number of large owners as well
as of a multitude of smaller holders. It i a very common and \,-idely s attered wood-lot tree,
and occurs in large quantities on the holdinO's of lumber companies throughout the South.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

A large part of the hickory used in the United States does not go through regular sawmills, but is cut directly into planks, squares, or billets, which are manufactured into spokes,
handles, rims, and other products. For this reason the census figures on the production of
hickor y lumber do not give a sum anywhere ncar the total production of hickory u ed
in the industries. During the years H)13 to 1917 the averao'e cut of hickory lumber was about
120 million board feet, and thi is less than half the average annual cut from 1907 to 1912,
whi h was 254 million feet. The cut is teadily declining.
Arkansa, T enne ee, West Virginia, Mi sis sippi, Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio lead in
the production of hickory lumber, and too-ethel' produce nearly three-fourth of the total .
Mi i sippi, Ohio Louisiana, Missouri, and Penn ylvania are al 0 important producing State.
Hickory from virgin forests such as arc found in the southern Appalachian and in the lower
Mi si ippi region, is cut in considerable quantities by large hardwood mills, which take it
along with their other timber. The great bulk of the hickory production, however, comes
Lany mall operator specialize on hickory quares and
from small or medium-sized inills.
billets, which are not recorded iu lumber cen us reports. For the year 1£)17, only six millf.\
reported cuts of more than a million board feet of hickory lumber, while about 150 reported
cuts between 100 thou and and 1 million feet.
The proportion of the hickory cut that would be suitable for airplane work depends very
largely upon the sizes in which it would be wanted. For hort, nanow strips, such as are u ed
for skids, a very large part of the cut would be suitable.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Available figures on the amounts of hickory used about SL-X: years ago by various industries indicate a total consumption of 390 million board feet, which is 50 per cent, or 130
million feet, in excess of the average lumber cut for the five years previous to that time. The
total cut of hickory lumber has fallen olI to about 40 pel' cent of what it was then, but it is
not known whether or not the total consumption of hickory has fallen off to the same extent.

SUPPLJE

AND PRODU TTON OF A1HC'RAFT WOOD .

453

Of the total of 390 million feet, 62 per cent was used by the vehicle industry, which took
more hickory than any other ,,,"ood, and, with the exception of oak, more hickory than all other
woods combined. Handle manufacturers used 31 per cent of the total. Forty-three per cent
of all wood used for handles was hickory. Agricultural implements took about 2~ per cent,
athletic goods, 1~· per cent, and numerous other indu tries, small quantities.
Most of the hickory cut is used in the 'woodworking centers of the Central and Ea tern
States. In 1913 about million feet of hickory in the log was exported, and this went chiefly
to Canada, South Africa, Australia, and Germany.
SUGAR MAPLE.
(Acer saccharum. )
This species is also known as hard maple, rock maple, and black maple.

DISTRIBUTION.

The range of sugar maple extend from southern NewfoundJand to Minnesota, and south to
ea tern Texa and northwestern Florida. It is of commercial importance chiefly in the Lake
tates, the Northeast, and alon o' the Appalachian Range to northern Georgia. The best maple
comes from Michigan, especially from the lower peninsula.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

ugar maple, being quite heavy, hard, tiff, resi tant to wear, and of uniform texture, is a
fairly satisfactory propeller wood, and has been 0 u ed where the requirements were not too
exacting. Becau' e of the same qualities it makes excellent face ply and fini h. It has also
been approved for bent work, sliids, and engine bearer. Its comparative abundance, wide
distribution, acces ibility, and comparative cheapness promise for it an important future in
airplane manufacture.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Sugar maple 0 CUiS scattered singly or in groups through mixed stands of hardwoods,
most important of which are birch, beech, and bas wood, and in stands of hemlock and white
fature
pine. It seldom forms a large proportion of the tand, except o,er very limited areas.
trees ordinarily run from 30 to 40 inches in diameter and from 100 to 120 feet in height, often
with clear boles of 60 feet or more when grown in the forest. Most of the maple is so situated
that it can be logged without any great difficulty, although much of it is not tributary to existing mills. It has been estimated that between 10 and 15 per cent of the remaining stand will
be cut in operations now in progress.
Accurate data on the total stand of maple timber are lacking, as is the case with most of
our pecies. The best available e timates indicate that there is between 40 and 50 billion board
feet of merchantable size (including both sugar maple and the soft maples), of which one-fourth
is in Michigan, and nearly three-fourths in the following nine States: Michigan, New York,
Missouri, Maine, Wiscon in, Arkan as, Ohio, Vermont, and Penn ylvania. In Missouri and
Arkan as soft maple is prevalent; in the other States named, ugar maple predominates. About
12 billion feet is standing in ew England and New York, 15 billion feet in the Lake States, and
G billion feet in the Appalachian region.
While there is a large quantity of maple in the aggregate on farmer' woodlot and similar
small holdings in the maple region, most of it is more or less open-grown, short-boled timber
which will not produce a large proportion of airplane material. Probably the greater part of
such material will come from virgin fore t stands such as exist in northern ew England, ew
York, the Lake State, and along the Appalachians, and are largely owned in fair-sized blocks
by lumber or land companies.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The annual cut of maple lumber in the nited tatesaveragedfrom 1913 to 1917, inclusive,
about 900 million board feet, of which it is estimated about 80 per cent was sugar maple. The
cut from] 907 to 1912 averaged a little less than a billion feet a year. While there is, therefore,

a gradual decline in production, the rate i still quite well maintained. Forty per cent of the
cut comes from Michigan and seven-tenths from the three States of Michigan , Wisconsin, and
West Virginia. In Michigan and Wiscon in morc than 95 per cent of the cut i made by large
mills whose production is in exce'!s of one million feet of maple each; in West Virginia about 80
per cent is cut by such mills. The larger concerns, as a rule, grade their lumber more carefully
than the smaller ones and are better equipped to turn out 'w ell-manufactured, high-grade
material in quantity.
Logging is carried on throughout the year in mo t operations, and horse logging is the
rule, although a few of the larger operators use steam . Railroads are employed in many of the
large enterprise .
The proportion of the cut which is suitable for use in aircraft depends, of course, upon the
purpose for which it is wanted. It is estimated that about 3 per cent will be of the size and
quality suitable for propeller if plain-sawed material is used, or 1 to H per cent if quartersawed material is required. About 15 per cent of the entire cut, or of that part of it produced
by larger mills at least, is in the two upper grades of fir ts and second, while about 25 per cent
is No.1 Common. From 30 to 40 million feet of maple is normally cut into veneer.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

More than 90 per cent of the cut of maple lumber is further manufactured. Perhaps the
most important use of high-grade sugar maple is for flooring. Of the total cut of all sp ecies of
maple, 31.6 per cent is made into planing mill products, including flooring. In quantity, the
maple manufactured by planing mills is exceeded among-hardwoods only by oak. Of the maple
lumber cut, 13.5 per cent is utilized for furniture and chairs, and the amount of it used for this
purpose is exceeded only by oak. For boot and shoe finding, 5.4 per cent of the maple cut is
used. This is 81 per cent of all the lumber taken by this industry and does not include the large
amount of maple so used without being cut into lumber. In the making of agricultural implements 4.8 per cent of the maple cut is employed. Oak and yellow pine are the only woods used
more extensively in this industry than maple. More maple than any other wood is utilized in
making musical instruments, the percentage being 4.5 of the total cut. For the manufacture of
handles, 4.1 per cent of the maple cut is taken, and only hickory and ash are used in larger
amounts than maple in this industry. In the making of vehicles, and especially for the frame- '
work of trucks and automobiles, 3.6 per cent of the maple cut is employed. Two per cent of
the maple cut is made into fixtures, and oak is the only wood used more largely than maple for
this purpose. Large quantities are used for woodenware, laundry appliances, spools and bobbins, refrigerators, car construction, trunks, sporting goo ds (exceeded only by hickory), profe sional and scientific instruments (exceeded only by cedar used for pencils), and toys. The
box and crate industry uses 9.6 per cent of the cut .
Maple flooring is sold all over the country. The maple used by the various industries is
sold largely in the Central and Northeastern States where these industri es are centered; consequently, very long railroad hauls are not ordinarily necessary.
OAKS. '
WHITE

OAKS: Wml'E OAK (Quercus alba).
Po T OAK (Quercus minor). BGR OAK (Quercus macrocarpa) . Cow
(Quercus micha!bXii). OVERCGP OAK (Quercus l!Jrata) . GffE TN'GT OAK (Quercus prinus) .
RED OAKS: RED OAK (Quercus rubra or borealis). 'rEXAN' OAK (Qnercus texana) . PIN' OAK (Quercus palustris).
SCARLET OAK (Quercus coccinea). YELLOW (o r BLACK) (Quercus velutina).
WILLOW OAK (Quercus phellos).
These twelve species furnish the greater part of the oak lumber cut in the United tates. A few other species in
each group furnish small quantities.
DISTRIBUTION.
OAK

T aken together, the species named are widely distributed througho ut the United States
east of the Great Plains. Nllmerous species ot scrub oaks of little or no value for lumb er occur
in the sou thern Rocky Mountain, Great Basin, and Pacific coast regions, while several species
tbat do produce some lumber occur in California and Oregon.

White oak occurs from southern Maine to southern Michigan, southern Minneso ta, east ern
Nebraska, and Kansas, and south to Texas and F lorida. It is most abundant and of greatest
commercial importance on the western slopes of the southern Appalachians and in the lower Ohio
Valley bottomlands. Post oak occurs from southern Massachusetts to Florida and west to Missouri and Texas, and is of greatest commercial importance on dry uplands of the Mississippi basin.
Bur oak occurs [rom Nova Scotia and ew Brunswick to southern Manitoba and eastern Montana, and south to central T ew England, Pennsylvania, central Tennessee, and T exas. It is of
greatest commercial importance in southern Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Cow oak occurs
on bottomlands in the Coastal Plain and Mississippi Valley regions from Delaware to Texas and
northward as far as southern Illinois and Incliana. It is of greatest commercial importance in
the lower Mississippi Valley. The range of overcup oak extends from Maryland through southern Indiana to southern Missouri and south to Florida and T exas. It is most abundant in
the lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf regions. Chestnut oak occurs in the Appalachian region
from central Jew England to Alabama, and is most important commercially in th e Cn,rolinas and
Tennessee.
Red oak ranges from Nova Scotia to north of Lake Huron, central Kansas, and along the
mountains to Georgia. It is commercially important chiefly in t.he Nort.heastern States.
Texan oak occurs in the Mississippi Valley from Iowa to Texas and up th~ Atlant.ic coast to
North Carolina, and is of greatest cOIDIDrrcial importance on the lower Mississippi bottomlands.
Pin oak occurs from southwestern New England to southern Missouri and southward to
Virginia, Kentucky, and northern Arkansas, and is most abundant in the lower Ohio b asin.
Scm'l et oak occurs from southern Maine to Jebraska, south to Illinois and the District of
Columbia, and along the mountains to North Carolina. It is most abundant in the Atlantic
coast region from Massachusetts to southern New .Tersey. Yellow oak occurs from southern
Maine to central Minnesota, and southward to northern Florida and eastern T exas. It is
common throughout most of its range. Willow oak grows in bottomlands of the Coastal
Plain region from Staten Island to Texas and up the Mississippi Valley to Missouri and Kentucky.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

The white oaks shrink and swell with the weather less than do the reel oaks. They glue
well, finish well, and are very strong. The lirst four species named have long been approved
as propeller woods. For propellers, quarter-saweel material is considered much superior to
plain-sawed, because it shrinks less in a radial direction. There has been, so far, considerable
prejudice against southern-grown white oaks. Whether this prejudi ce is justified is not yet
fully Imown, but, with improved technique in the drying and working of lumber from these
species it is probable that they may make satisfactory propeller woods.
The red oaks have not so far been used to any extent for propellers. It is possible, however,
that selected, quartered reel oak, at least of the northern species, may b e found satisfactory .
There is considerable variation in the strength properties of red. oak lumber, even of one species.
Moreover, red oak is more likely to be defective than white oak.
White oak of the four approved species has also been approved for structural and bent
work on wings and fuselages.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Oak occurs throughout most of its range on n early all sites except the highest slopes and
ridges. In the extreme northern part of the United States it does not make up an important
proportion of the stand; but the proport.ion of oak increases to the southward, and from southern New England and the Central States to the Gulf the oaks are a very important part of the
hardwood forests. III much of the region there is more oak than all other hardwood species
combiner'l.. Thus the oak lumber cut in the States of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Illinois,
K entucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Oldahoma, and Texas exceeds the cut of all other hardwoods,
while there is almost as much oak cut as all other ha.rdwoods combined in Tew Jersey, Pennsylva.nia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Arkansas.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVI ORY COl\:! HTTEE FOR AERONAU TIC ..

Only very rough e tim ate of the stand of oak are available, and these do not distingui h
the different pecie. It ha been judged that about 47 per cent of the volume of all oaks belong~ in the white oak group, and 53 per cent in the red oak o-roup.
White oak proper comprise
nearly 22 per cont of the total, and tho foUl' specie that have been approved for propeller
con titute approximately one-third of the Lotal stand of oak, which i e~ timated to be bet"'-een
150 and 175 billion board feet.
About 40 per cent of the stand of oak i in the lower Missi sippi Valley region, 25 per cenL
in tho southern Appalachain region, and 15 per cent in the central woodlot region. Even in
the orLhea t and in the woodlot reo-ion, thero are till orne virgin ~ tands of oak which ha>-e
been pre erved for variou reason.
lost of the old-growth oak, however, is now in the South.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

During tho period 1913 to 1917 the average annual cut of oak lumber of all specie wa
approximately 3 billion board feet , which is 00 million feet Ie s than Lhe average cut during
the preceding ix years. The general tendency indicates a sLeady decline in the production of
oak, a the virgin supplie ' become more nearly exhau. ted. Less than half as much oak lumbor
was produced in 1917 a' in 1907. Be ' ide.:; the oak sawed into lumber, a great deal that is fit
for lumber is awod into tic.:;, rived inLo taYe , or u ed for ,eneer. From 30 to 50 million feet
of white oak is made inLo veneer eyery year, while the white oak hC\yed into tie would produce
from 500 to 1,000 million hoard feet of lumber. Noarly half of Lho oak lumber is produced in
We t Virginia, Tenne sec, Arkansas, and K entu ky, and eight-tenLh'i of the toLal comes from
the e StaLes together with Virginia, lissiRdippi; Missouri, N orLh Carolina, P enn.sylvania, and
Ohio.
More than half of the awmill in the nited States saw oak lumber. These include tho
very mallest mills a well a orne of the largest. For the year 1917, 22 mills in the southern
Appalachian region and 16 in the lower Mis i ippi Valley region reported cuts of more than 5
million foet of oak each, while omo 33 reported cuts of betwoen 1 and 5 million feet each.
10 t of the e mills cut other species as well a oak ; a few make oak a specialty.
Logging in most of the oak reo-ion i carried on during the greater part of the year, though
more timber i cut in the fall and winter than during the pring and summer months. The small
operator and many of the larger ones u e animals for logging, and haul logs to their mills by
wagon, truck, or rail. :M any of the large concerns in the South log with team, and mo t of
them operate logging railroads. A few establishments, particularly in the farming sections,
buy logs from farmers and contractor .
It has been estimated that at the present time about 58 per cent of the oak lumber cut is
white oak. Of this about 27 per cent i cut into sawed ties and large timber, and 20 per cent of
the remainder grades firsts and second. To get quarter-sawed material 8 inches or more wide,
such as is wanted for propeller , logs 23 inche or more in diameter are required. Approximately
15 per cent of the fu ts and second cut by the larger mills will make quarter- awed propeller
material. About two-thirds of the white oak i cut by these largor mills, the vory mall mill not
being equipped for quarter-sawing. On thi basi , about O. 5 of 1 per cent of the total oak
lumber cut will bo suitable for propeller. Of course, the proportion of such material produced
by diil'erent oporator' will vary widely. Mills that buy selected logs can cut a very much highor
proportion than tho e that cut their Own log as they come to them.
MARKETS AND U ES FOR THE LUMBER.

low-grade material) into boxe and crates; 7 per cent into vehicle ; 2 per cent each into agricultural implement, fixture, and railway car ; 1 per cent each into hipbuilding and refrigerator ; and smaller amounts into most of the other ind~stries which use wood.
High-grade white oak of large sizes, which will yield propeller material, is cut largely into
lumber for furniture, railway car, and hipbuilding, or into veneers. A considerable quantity,
particularly in the South, i~ rived into tave for tight cooperage.
YELLOW POPLAR.
(Liriodendron tulipijera.)

This specie is also known as tulip poplar, tulip tree, white wood, and hickory poplar. Cucumber ( Magnolia
acuminata) and evergreen mao-nolia (J£. joetida), which are usually cut and sold with poplar and have about the same
strength properties, are includ ed with it in the foll owing disCllssion.
DISTRIBUTION.

Yellow poplar occurs in all tate's east of the Mississippi River except Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Wisconsin, and occurs also in Missouri , Arkansas, and Louisiana. Cucumber
docs not occur quite so far to thC' northC'ast and to the south as poplar. Evergreen magnolia
is found principally in the southern ...:Hlantic and Gulf coast reo-ions. Viro-in stands of poplar
containing large-sized timber are now to a considerable extent confinC'cl to the Appalachian
r('gion southward from Prnnsylvania, and to hotLomlands of T('nnC'ss('e , Grorgia, and Alahama.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Yellow poplar has bC'C'n used wi 1,h satisfactory rC'sults for most of the woodrn parts of
aircraft. While a little heavier than spruce and inferior to it in shock resistance, it is comparatively strong, free from checks and shake, retains its shape well, and is easy to work. It is a
fairly satisfactory substitute for sprucC' in making wing beams and struts, as well as for wing
ribs, and has been used to some extent for prop lIers, particularly by the French. It makes
excellent cores for plywood and has been so utilized in considC'rable quantities.
Its wide distribution, its accessibility, its oeCUITence within easy reach of centers of aircraft
manufacture, as well as its excellent qualities, make yellow poplar a very important species
for aircraft construction.
. SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Yellow poplar novel' occurs in pure stands over considerable areas, but appears as scattered
individuals or groups in forests of mixed hardwoods, or of hardwoods and hemlock, pine, or
occasionally spruce. In the southern Appalachians, the region of its greatest abundance, it
constitutes from 10 to 30 per cent of the stand in virgin timber, or from 1 to 3 thousand board feet
per acre over extensive areas. Occasionally single acres have been reported having as much as
75,000 board feet. In the bottomIands farther south a smaller proportion of the stand is poplar.
In virgin stands trees average from 30 to 36 inches in diameter, with 50 to 60 feet clear of
branches; diameters of 6 feet are by no means rare.
Poplar is a tree of the lower and middle slopes and coves, and, therefore, to a considerable
extent is in fairly accessible places. However, part of the region where it grows is not yet
provided with road or railroad facilities, and it is estimated that noL more than half of the
remaining virgin stand is accessible to existing sawmills.
The total amount of standing poplar is not known. Rough estimates place it at about
91 billion board feet, of which perhaps 7 billion feet is virgin timber. Three-fourths of the
total stand is in the States of West Virginia, orth Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia.
All but a few million feet is in private ownership. The greater part of the remaining virgin
timber is in fairly large holdings of lumb I' companies, coal companies, and land investment
companies.
econd-growth stands are held by the large companies and by many small owners
in different parts of the poplar region.

SUPPLIES AND PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT WOODS.

PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The annual cut of yellow poplar lumber from 1913 to 1917 averaged 4 0 million board
feet, and is steadily declining. About one-half as much is now cut each year as was produced
ten years ago. West Virginia now produces one-fourth of the total, and is followed by rrennessee, K entucky, Georgia, Virginia, orth Carolina, and.Alabama, in the order named . These
States produce more than 90 per cent of the total cut.
About one-half of the total is cut by large, well-equipped mills of which there arc approximately 75 cutting more than one million feet of poplar each. Another one-fourth of the total
is cut by some 350 medium-sized or large mills, each of which cuts in excess of 100,000 board
feet of poplar. Small mills cut the rest, mostly from second-growth stands which produce
very little high-grade lumber. Except for a few which buy logs and specialize on poplar, all
of these mills cut a variety of species, and take poplar only as it comes in the stand. Of the
lumber cut by the 75 largest producers, 18 per cent was poplar, and by the smaller producers,
about 7 per cent. On the basis of their rated capacity and these proportions of poplar,
large mills are capable of producing 275 million feet of poplar, while the medium-sized mills
could produce 150 million feet. The smaller mills, which now cut less than 100 thousand feet
of poplar each, could probably produce 100 million feet a year if operated to their full capacity.
At the present rate of cutting, the existing larger mills have suffLcient standing poplar to
last them, on the average, from 10 to 12 years. It seems probable that, after the next 15 to 20
years, almost the entire cut will come from small mills and largely from second-growth stunus.
Logging is now done with steam quite generally in the southern part. of the poplar region,
while horses are commonly used in West Virginia. Practically all of the large operations employ l"ailroads. A few operators use motor trucks to some extent to bring in logs, and several
large companies along the Ohio River, depend upon water transportation. Operations are
carried on throughout the year, although it is customary to try to log the greater part of the
poplar in fall and winter, on account of the tendency of logs to sapstain when they are cut during
the summer. Logs are seldom cut more than If; feet in length, though longer ones can b e gotten
out by the larger operators when such mat.erial is w'fLUted.
Under normal conditions no particular effort is made to saw straight-grained material, but
the larger producers use con iderable care to saw lumber of the upper grades. Poplar is characteristically straight grai.ned, with little taper, so that probably 75 per cent of the clear lumber
produced has grain st.raight enough to make it suitable for aircraft use.
Most of. the airplane material will probably come from the upper grades, including pa.nel,
wide _ o. 1, firsts anel seconds, and saps and selects. The proportion of this miLterial that is
produced varies widely with different stands and regions. The average figme for the large
mills is about 26 per cent, and it is estimated that perhaps 75 per cent of this amount "ill be
suitable for airplanes. Probably not more than 5 or 6 per cent of the material from secondgrowth stands will meet present airplane standards . It is judged that approximately 60 million
board feet of the pre 'ent cut of ::350 million feet will fulfill the requirements for airplane work
if it is sawed to the desired si~es.
In addition to the above lumber cut, from 25 to 35 million feet of yellow poplar, chiefly
high-grade material, is ordinarily cut into veneer each year. Much of this is suitable for airplane plywood.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Practically the entire cut of yellow poplar is further manufactured, and it is used by a very
great variety of industries. Thirty-three per cent of the cut is made into sash, doors, finish,
siding, and other planing mill products. For furniture, including chairs, 7 ~ per cent is used.
Seven per cent goes into vehicles, and only hickory and oak are used in largerquantitiesby this
industry. Six per cent is employed in making musical instruments. In this iudustry, maple
is the only wood more largely used than poplar. For car construction, 4t p er cent of the poplar
cut is taken, and oak is the only hardwood more extensively employed. In manufacturing
bungs and faucets, 21- per cent of the poplar is utilized- 6 per cent of all the wood used by this

462

industry. Two per cent is made into fixtures, and the same amonnt into agricultural implement. A large number of industries use smaller quantitie. Box and crate manufacturers
take 23 per cent of the cut, mostly low grade material.
Yellow poplar is sold in large quantities in the Central and Northeastern States, where
most of the wood-u ing industries are located. Considerahle quantities are normally exported
to the countries of western Europe, in who e markets American yellow poplar is a standard wood.
BLACK WALNUT.
( JugZans nigra.)

DISTRIBUTION.

Black walnut occurs from southern Xew England to southern Ontario, southern Minnesota,
and south to eastern Texas and Florida. It reaches its best development and is found in largest
quantities in the central woodlot region centering in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, eastern Iowa,
l\Iissouri, Kentucky, Tenne sec, and West Yirginia. It ha also been planted to some extent
beyond its natural range. Tho mall quantities,.limitod distribution, and habits of growth of
the other black walnut species, the Mexican and California walnuts, render them of no importance as a source of airplane material.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Black walnut make the be 1, propellers of a.ny native pecies. It i ea y to work, finishes
well, is very resistant to weal' and to hocks, and retains it. place remarkably well. It also
make excellent facing plY\\'ood, both flat and bent.
While, on account of the scarcity of the remaining high-grade walnut and its consequent
high price, other woods may in the future 0111e to be used much more for propellers, it is likely
that walnut "rill always be an important wood for this purpose.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Walnut has been in demand for many years for furniture, veneer, cabinet work, and gunstocks, and the once large supply was already greatly reduced prior to 1914. Since that year,
and particularly since 1917, the enormous demand for walnut for war u os has made serious
inro!;td on the remaining acces ible supply.
It occurs scattered singly through stand of mixed hardwoods, and is a very common
field or roadside tree in the region of its best development. The cut in r cent years has probably
come largely from trees grown in the op~n or in groves. The best trees are found in fairly
rich agricultural soil, where they grow somewhat rapidly and reach large size. The average
trees that remain in the more X or them States are somewhat smaller than those in the tates
farther south, but are of better quality. Eighty per cent of the logs now cut run between 12
and 20 inches in diameter at tho small end. The open-grown walnut timber is, of course,
practically all accessible, but a large par.t of -that grown in the forest is some distance back
from roads and not oa y to get at.
Estimate of the exi ting tand of waInu are very unsati factory and differ widely. The
best ayailable figures, which probably do not allow for the greatly timulated cut during the
past two or three year, indicate a tand of about 50 million board feet. The eight State,
Mis omi, Illinois, Tenne ee, Kentu ky, Ohio, Arkansas, and Indiana, have about 70 pOl' cent
of the total stand. The entire amount is di tributed about as follows: Central woodlot region,
550 million feet; southern Appalachian region, 200 million feet; Gulf and Atlantic States, 100
million feet. Thi estimate includes aU tree over inche in diameter; therefore, the stand of
timber, about 1G inche in diameter and upward, that will produce airplane material, mu 1, be
very much smaller. By far the greater rart of the standing walnut is widely scattered and is
in the hauds of mall holders, most of whom are farmers rather than timberland owners.

UAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS .

PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

Because of the cattered distribution of walnu t and its production by a large number of
small mill , figures on the annual cut of lumber are probably far from complete. The average
annual cut during everal years prior to 1914 was about 40 million feet, besides considerable
quantities cut into veneer or exported in the log. Some 13 million feet of logs were exported
in 1913. Alter 1914, from 75 to 90 million feet a year was cut and by 191< a much larger amount
had been reached. It is probable that the production of walnut lumber will soon fall back to
the prewar figure or considerably below it. Indeed,. this must happen unless the supply of
timber is much larger than the mo t optimistic estimates have allowed.
Some 200 mills normally cut walnut lumber along with other woods. Only about a dozen
mills ordinarily specialize on walnut to the exclusion of other species, and these probably cut
nearly half of the total. Walnut mills draw on wide sections of country for their log supply, and
have to maintain considerable forces of buyers to locate, purchase, and 'as emble the logs at,
shipping points . Logs are often shipped 300 miles to the mill .
Walnut lumber intended for ordinary commercial uses is generally plain sawed in order to
bring out the grain, and no particular attempt is made to saw straight-grained material. All important producers are now entirely familial' with sa"'ing airplane material, and may be expected to
con tinue to saw it if there is a sufficient demand for such material at prices that 'will attract them .
It is estimated that on the average about 1 per cent of the log scale is suitable for propeller
stock, considering only logs 1:.. inches and upward in diameter . At certain mills the proportion rW1S considerably higher. In some instances this is due to greater care being exercised
in selecting logs for purchase, and in others to the better average quali ty of the walnut that is
grown in the Korth. It eems likely that with the return of normal conditions the quality of
logs obtained will tend to deteriorate, or el e the cut will fall very much below the figures at
which it stood in recent years.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Black walnut has long been valued for cabinet-making and for gunstocks. It is normally
employed in large quantities in the manufacture of sewing machines, musical instruments,
furniture, interior finish and fixtures, and for many lesser uses. It is widely utilized in the
wood-manufacturing centers of the nited States, and for many years previous to the war was
exported, mostly in the log. The greater rart of walnut exports formerly went t.o Germany,
and considerable quantities to Great Britain. During the war large quantities of propeller an d
gunstock material were sent to the allied countries, particularly France and Great Britain .
COTTONWOOD.
cmnION COTTOr WOOD (Populus delloides).

,
This species is also known as big cottonwood, yellow cottonwood, and at'olina poplar.
SWAMP COTTONWOOD (Populus heterophylla) .

This species is also known as black cottonwood, river cottonwood, and swamp poplar.
These two species are the most abundant and [urni h the bulk of the cut. Small amounts of various species, including Balm of Gilead, narrow-leaf cottonwood, black cottonwood (we tern), a pen, and others, are also cut.
DISTRIBUTION.

The common cottonwood occurs over practically the entire United States east of the Rocky
Mountains, except in the extreme r ortheast and in southern Florida. The swamp cottonwood
is largely confined to the Coastal Plain from Connecticut to western Louisiana, and up the
Mississippi valley to southern illinois and Indiana. The optimum region for both is the valley
of the lower Mississippi with its tributary streams.

AN

UAL REPORT

ATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Cottonwood is low in iM strength properties, but is light, tough, and fairly easy to work.
Furthermore, it is cheap, fairly abundant, and accessible. It has been employed to some xtent for plywood cores, in aircraft construction, and its use for this purpose may be considerably
extended.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

The greater portion of the cottonwood lumber cut is from the common cottonwood. It is
found principally along streams and often in pure stands or mixed with willows over small areas.
Such stands are usually very open. Much of the mature cottonwood is associated with ash,
soft maple, sycamore, red gum, tupelo, cypress, oaks, and other hardwoods, in mL"'{ed stands.
Tn the lower Mississippi valley the trees reach large size, with diameters of from 4 to 6 feet and
heights between 125 and 175 feet. Growth is extremely rapid and yields per acre are relatively
large. The swamp cottonwood grows in similar situations and is cut along with the common
cottonwood.
The aVl1ilable estimates of the stand of cottonwood are very rough and unsatisfactory.
It has been judged that there is approximately 10 billion board feet in trees above inches in
diameter. Two-thirds of it is in Arkansas, Louisiana, l1issouri, Mississippi, and Oklahoma.
More than three-fourth is in the lo,,-er Mississippi valley region, a little more than a billion feet
in the Coastal Plain region, and possibly three-fourths billion feet in th Great Lakes region.
Most of the extensive stands of the Mississippi region are owned by large lumber companies.
The cottonwood in Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, and Indiana is mostly in planted gr9ves
and owned in small units by fil,r mers and others.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The average annual cut of cottonwood lumber in the United States between 1913 and 1917
was 195 million board feet, which is nearly 50 million feet less than the average cut during the
preceding SLX years. In addition, large amounts of cottonwood are cut into veneer, excelsior,
and pulpwood. The cut is gradually decreasing, which indicates that the supply of standing
timber is probably becoming limited. Considering the rapid growth of cottonwood, however,
it would seem that the present rate of cutting might be maintained almost indefinitely if the
forests are carefully handled.
The most important cottonwood-producing State is fississippi, which cuts more than onefourth of the total. A close second is Arkansas, followed by Louisiana, Minnesota, and Missouri.
These:fiv States cut about three-fourths of the total. The cut in Minnesota is chiefly aspen
and Balm of Gilead, and no mill in that State reports a cut in excess of a million board feet of
cottonwood. In the South, 27 mills reported for 1917 cuts of between 1 and 5 million feet, and
9 mills reported cuts in excess of 5 million feet.
Cottonwood, together with associated species, is logged to stream banks, usually by animals,
and from there it is usually towed on barges or in rafts to the mills, which are often many miles
distant. Logging operations proceed throughout the year, except as they may be interfered
with by floods. The lumber that might be used for aircraft will come large'ly from material
graded as wagon-box boards and :firsts and seconds. The proportion of these grades in the
lumber cut varies from about 25 per cent in comparatively young stands to 40 or 50 per cent in
old stands of large timber. These figures apply to the lower Mississippi valley cottonwood
only; the proportion is probably smaller in the stands farther to the north.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Practically the entire cut of cottonwood lumber is further manufactured. Cottonwood
is in great demand for boxes and crates, pond nearly two-thirds of the lumber cut is used by this
industry. The vehicle industry uses about 10 per cent of the cut, chiefly for wagon-box boards,
which requre high-grade material. Slightly more than 6 per cent goes into planing-mill products, 5 per cent into agricultural implements, 4 per cent into woodenware, nearly 3 per cent

SUPPLIES M. D PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT WOODS.

467

into laundry appliances, about 2 per cent into furniture. Refrigerators, trunks, railroad cars.
musical instruments, and fL'Xtures take considerable quantities. Cottonwood veneer in the form
of plywood is widely used for furniture, musical instruments, and similar uses. A great deal
of cottonwood not reported in the lumber cut figures goes into excelsior , and a large amount
is made into pulp for paper manufacture.
Cottonwood is used throughout most of the United States, and considerable quantities of
plywood made from it ,,~ere shipped to Europe before the war.

RED GUM.
(Liquidambar styraciJlua.)
This species is al;;o known a satin walnut, sweet gum, and liquidamba.r.

DISTRIBUTION.

R ed gum occur from southern Connecticut to southeastern Missouri and south to Texas
and Florida. It reaches its best development and is most abundant in the lower Mississippi
valley, from the mouth of the Ohio River southward.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Red gum is an excellent material for the manufacture of plywood, and is so used to a very
grea t extent for commercial purposes. Its use has been approved for airplane plywood. The
large and fairly accessible supply of this species makes it a promising wood for future use in
the aircraft industry.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Such incomplete estimates as arc available indicate a total stand of red gum of approximately 44 billion board feet; of this amount 30 billion feet is in the Missis ippi Valley, inclucling tributary streams, and 14 billion feet is in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain region .
The States having the largest supplies are, in the order named: Mississippi, Arkansas, Loui iana,
Texas, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. These States together have
about 0 per cent of the total.
Although limited areas of young stands arc occasionally found, red gum usually occurs
scattered t rough mixed hardwood stand. It grow chiefly on bottom lands more or less
subject to overflow during part of the year. Its associates include such species as cottonwood,
soft maple, ash, tupelo, oak, pecan, cypress, and sycamore. The gum i frequently the predominant pecies. ~fature tree often reach diameters of 4 or 5 feet or even more.
The greater part of the remaining stand of mature gum is owned by large land and lumber
companies. Since the gum land will for the most part be suitable for agriculture when drained,
it seems probable that the supply of timber when once removed will never be renewed in anything like the original quantity.
PRODUCTION OF LUMBER.

The averaO'e annual cut of red gum lumber between 1913 and 1917 was 740 million feet,
or about 100 million feet more than the average cut during the preceding six years. In 1917
it was about 790 million feet. Production of this species will probably not fall below the present figure for several years. The figures-given do not include the large amounts cut for veneer.
In 1910 and 1911, the la t years for which reports on that product are available, nearly 150
million feet, log scale, of red gum was cut into veneer, practically all by the rotary process .
About 35 mills reported for 1017 cuts of red gum in excess of 5 million feet each . All of these
are in the lower Mississippi region. About 200 mills in this region and 35 in the Atlantic
coast region reported cuts of between 500 thousand and 5 million board feet. Arkansas leads
in the production of red gum, and is followed by Mississippi and Louisiana. These three States
cut about two-thirds of the total.
Logs are generally cut in the fall and allowed to season somewhat before being towed out
on rafts or barge. A few operators in dr.ier territory have railroads and use steam in logging.

SUPPLIES AND PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT WOODS.

469

Usually only the larger trees are cut, since small trees contain a large proportion of sap~ood ,
which brings comparatively low prices.
It is estimated that from 20 to 25 per cent of the cut in the Mississippi region is firsts and
seconds clear heart, while in the coast region not more than from 5 to 8 per cent is of this grade.
Clear sap runs about 25 per cent in the valley States and 32 per cent on the coast. Material
suitable for aircraft veneer would probably correspond to these two grades.
MARKETS AND USES FOR THE LUMBER.

A very large proportion of the clear heart gum used to be exported to the countries of
western Europe and around the Mediterranean, where it is in great favor forfurniture and finish.
Practically all of the rest is used in industries in this country, almost none being consumed as
rough lumb er.
Approximately half of the lumber and veneer used in this country is made into boxes and
crates. The quantity of red gum used by this industry is surpassed only by that of white and
. yellow pines. Fifteen per cent is used for planing-mill products, chiefly finish. Thirteen per
cent goes into furniture, 3 per cent into vehicles (wagon boxes), 2t per cent into sewing machines,
and smaller quantities into a great variety of industries.
MAHOGANY.
CE J.' vrRAL AMERICAN MAHOGANY (Swietenia mahagoni and S. macrophylla).
AFRICAN MAHOGANY (Khaya senegalensis).
Numerous other species of Khaya, Entandrophragma, Trichilia, and other genera are also sole a~ African tnaho~any
I
PHILIPPIr E MAIIOGANY (Shorea polysperma).
This species is also sold under the name of TanguiJe or Dataan mahogany. Red Lauan (S. negrosensis) is sometimes called Philippine mahogany.
DISTRIBUTION.

True mahogany (the American species) occurs from southern Florida to Colombia, Venezuela, and Brikh Guiana. It is most abundant in outhern Mexico (Vera Cruz, Tabasco, Campeche, and Chiapas districts), in Central America, and in the larger i lands of the We t Indie .
African mahogany is found in the for~st belt of the west coast of Africa from the Senegal
River to the southern boundary of Angola, and across central Africa to Germ.an East Africa
and Madagascar. The largest supplies are in a belt varying in width from a few miles up to 200
mile, from the Senegal River to the iger, and in a narrower trip from southern Jigeria to the
northern part of French Congo . The best specie, Khaya senegalensis, ~s nearly all between the
Senegal and the iger, although it is cattered to some extep.t in the forests of Ea t Africa.
The so-called Philippine mahoganies occur in the Philippines and in neighboring parts of
Malaysia.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

The true mahogany is a mo"t excellent propeller wood, and ha been very extensively used for
that purpo e. Selected pieces of African mahogany are as satisfactory as the true mahogany, but
on account of the wide variation in strength properties between the different species and between
different lots of lumber from the arne pecies, together with the difficulties in distinguishing
the different pecies by inspection, African mahogany has not been popular as a propeller wood.
The Bataan mahogany from the Philippines has also found a limited use for propellers.
Both the American and the African mahoganies m.ake excellent plywood, but will hardly
be used for that purpose on a large scare becau e of their high co t as compared with· native
woods which are quite as satisfactory.
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

Mahogany occurs a a cattered tree in dense tropical forests, which are compo ed of a
very large number of species. This i equally true of the Central American and the African
specie. The supplie of standing timber are very little lmown except in the regions which
have been worked for years.

470

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY C01\1MITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The total stand of true mahogany in Central America and Mexico ha been roughly estimated at 19 billion 450 million board feet, and that in Cuba at 750 million board feet. Of
this, about one-third is a\'ailable to present operations; the re t can be reached only by the construction of railroad or by the introduction of dillerent methods of logging. Mexico has 15
billion feet, Honduras It billion feet, Nicaragua 1 t billion feet, Guatemala three· fourths of
a billion feet, Costa Rica one-fourth of a billion feet, and Panama and British Honduras 100 million feet each. Information is not a\'ailable regarding the supplies in the West Indies, with
the exception of Cuba, or in S::>uth America. The true mahogany reache diameters of from 4
to 6 feet and heights of 100 feet or more. The log which are produced now do not a\'eruge as
large as did those produced earlier, because the best of the accessible timber has been remo\'ed.
Almo t nothing is known regarding the stand of African mahogany, except that, a'l compared with the present consumption, the u-pply is almost unlimited. The largest quantities
of S)negal mahogany are in the Liberia, Ivory Coast, and Gold Coast territories, while there
are large amounts of other specie' in Kamerun, French Congo, Lagos, southern Nigeria. Spanish .
Guinea, and smaller amounts in S3negal, Sierra Leone, Angola, Belgian Congo, and Madagascar.
African mahogany trees are very large, so that 4 or 5 foot squared logs are common.
The supply of Philippine mahogany (Bataan) available to the larger existing plants is
estimated at about 5,400 mill.ion board feet.

Almost all of the Central American and African mahogany cut is exported from the producing countries. M03t of it is shipped in the log or hewed into square timbers. Logs are cut by
natives, who work either for contractors or directly for the mahogany firms, and the production
varies con iderably from year to year, depending upon markets, weather conditions (particularly
III Central America, where the mahogany logs are taken down to the coast by river {loods), and
other factors. Logging operations are usually carried on almost entirely by hand labor. A
few largo concerns use steam or gasoline tractors t o haul their logs, but in mo t, operations even
the largest logs are pulled to the streams by natives.
The exports of mahogany from S::>uth and Central America and the West Indies in H113,
which was a fairly representative year, amounted approximately to 100 million tons or about
50 million board feet. Of this amount the United States u ed about half, Great Britain about
35 per cent (including that reexported from the United S ~ate,,), and France nearly all of the
remainder. The export of African mahogany in the same year amounted to about 150 million
tons, or 75 million board feet, of which about two-thirds went to Great Britain, one-seventh
to the United S tates, and the rest was about equally divided between France and Germany.
Liverpool is the great mahogany warket of the world, and much of the mahogany which goes
there is reexported. In 1913, the United States imported orne 21 million board feet of mahogany from Great Britain. This wa doubtless principally African mahogany from Liverpool.
The importation of mahogany into the United States is largely controlled by a few companies. The amount of lumber sawed in thi country varies con iderably from year to year,
but for the pa t five or six year' the reported cut has averaged between 20 and 25 million board
feet. This may be somewhat Ie than the actual total cut. Leading States in the production
of mahogany lumber are Loui iana ( Jew Orlean ), Kentucky (Louisville), Indiana (Indianapolis), Illinois (Chicago), Ohio, and California. From 28 to 42 per cent of the Central American
mahogany that is imported is suitable for propellers. The proportion of African mahogany
that might be so u ed can not be e timated, because the character of the timber that may be
received is uncertain.
•
USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Before the war, about 50 million feet of mahogany was used each year in the United States.
Thirty-six per cent of thi was u ed for furniture, 17 per cent for musical instruments, 15 per
cent for interior fini h, 12 per cent for car fmi h, 11 per ceRt for fixtures, 3 per cent for ca_kets
and coffin", 2 per cent for hip and boat finish, and small quantities for various other purposes.

SPANISH CEDAR.
(Cedrela odorata.)

This sp ecies is also called Indian mah ogany.

DISTRIBUTION.

Spanish cedar occurs form Tampico, Mexico, southward to Brazil, and through the West
Indies. A closely r elated species, the toona or cedar mahogany COedrela toona), grows in the
East Indies.
USE IN AIRCRAFT.

Spanish cedar, being light, durable, easily worked, and strong for its weight, mll.kes excellent
ply wood, and has been used to a considerable extent for thin planking for flying boats and fl oats .
SUPPLY OF TIMBER.

This species occurs in about the same situations as mahogany, with which it is associated
in the range of the latter. It is scattered through mixed stands, but is pr obably somewhat
more abundant than the mahogany. Cedar trees reach great size, diameters up to 6 feet being
not uncommon. Information is not available l' e~arding the amount of standing cedar except
that it is known to be large.
PRODUCTION. OF LUMBER.

Spanish cedar is frequently cut in connection with mahogany. Cedar logs are often used
in rafts to h elp keep the heavier mahogany logs afloat. Considerable quantities of cedar are
logged independently. D ata on the total production of Spanish cedar are not at hand. From
15 to 20 million fe et is imported in the log into the United States in normal years, while the
imports of sawed lumber, chiefly from Cuba, are estimated at about 10 million feet a year .
Large quantities go also to Liverpool, London, and Hamburg. Since only selected material is
u u ally im por'ted, a very large proportion of it would be suitable for use in aircraft. Our
largest im;>or ts are from Cuba. Other countri es which supply considerable quanties are Brazil,
Mexico, British Honduras, Colombia, Nicalagu a, Costa Rica, P anama, and Dutch Guiana.
USES FOR THE LUMBER.

Almos t the entire output of Spanish cedar is normally made into cigar boxes . In the
United States more than 99 per cent of the cedar used goes to that industry.

THE EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON THE STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.
By the Forest Products Laboratory.

SUMMARY OF GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.

The general conclusions stated below arc the outcome of a series of tests which included 26
approximately 100 kiln runs, and over 100,000 mechanical tests. The series was undertaken in cooperation with the War and Navy Departments, and in continuance of earlier
investigations on the basis of which the Forest Products Laboratory had drafted, for the War
Department, Signal Corps Specification 20500, General Kiln-drying Process for Airplane Stock.!
This spe~ ification was based on the results of tests of Sitka spruce and white ash material
representing three preliminary kiln runs at the laboratory, and on the general knowledge of
kiln drying and the properties of wood which the researches of the laboratory in earlier years
had developed. The material for the first tests had been arranged for before the United States
entered the war, as it was antecipated that kiln drying of airplane stock would become
necessary; and the preliminary runs antedated the adoption by the Government of its aircraft
program. Signal Corps Specification 20500 was submitted to the War Department in July, 1917.
While its adoption as an emergency measure was believed entirely justified, additional tests
of its safety for spruce and ash and of its applicability to many other species were considered
essential. It was desirable also to ascertain the possibility of using more rapid processes.
The present monograph presents results of the tests made for these pu.rposes.
The general ' conclusions reached are:
.
1. That wood may have its strength properties, particularly toughness or resistance to
shock, quite seriously damaged without any visible evidence of such damage. Hence, appearance of the material can not, where maximum strength is essential, be accepted as the sole
basis of judgment of the effect of a drying process on wood.
2. That the effect of a given process is not the same on all species of wood.
3. That apparently a given process may be entirely safe for some but quite detrimental
to other material of a species .
4. That proper kiln drying produces material fully equal in all strength properties to that
resulting from air drying under the most favorable conditions.
5. That spe ification 20500-A of the Bureau of Aircraft Production (Table 1 or 2 as specified) can in most cases be expe( ted to produce material fully equal to air-dried.
6. That best results (with respect to strength properties) on Douglas fir will result from
the use of somewhat milder drying conditions than those laid down in Specification 20500-A
(Table 1) . Table 2 of this specification (temperatures 105 0 F. initial to 135 0 F. final and relative
humidities 85 per cent initial to 40 per cent final) is recommended for drying Dougl as fir.
7. That in some species there is apparently no relation between drying temperatures
up to 180 0 F. and the strength properties of the dry material. Such a conclusion, however,
needs further confirmation, and temperatures higher .than those of Specification 20500-A have
not been recommended.
This work has been done under the necessity of getting results as quickly as possible and
with the primary object of checking the safety of the general kiln-drying specifications when
applied to the drying of airplane lumber on a commercial scale, together with the more or less
mcidental object of ascertaining if conditions adapted to more rapid drying could be used.
Under these circumstances it has not been possible to investigate the subject in the fundamental
spe~ies,

way which it merits. Completion of the work already begun is contemplated and it is hoped
to be able later to carry out experiments to determine the effect of the various factors involved,
both separately and in combination, and to ascertain the maximum temperature and minimum
humidity that can be safely applied at any stage of the drying process. It is hoped also to carry
on comprehensive investigations of the closely related subject of the bending of wood, for the
purpose of determining the steaming or other processes best adapted to successful bending
and to secure more accurate knowledge of the effect of such processes on the strength of the
wood .
NECESSITY FOR KILN DRYING.

Previous to the entrance of the United States into the war aircraft engineers had not
encouraged the use of other than air-seasoned wood, particularly for those parts requiring the
maximum strength. It had not been believed that it was pos ible for material to be properly
prepared for such exacting service in any other way than by air seasoning over a period of
several months or even years, depending on the size of the stock and on the climatic conditions
at the point where the seasoning took place. The use of kiln-dried material had been t abooed
because it had not been demon trated that optimum results with respe~ t to the strength proome of the prejudice against kiln drying was
perties could be se~U1'ed through kiln drying.
undoubtedly due to acquaintance or experience with material which had been improperly kiln
dried and hence greatly damaged.
Upon the adoption by our Government of an aircraft produ tion program of great magnit'.1de it was easy to be seen that the stock of air-dried material of the species then accepted for
aircraft construction would be exhausted before even a fraction of the production planned for
the :first year could be accomplished. Hence, the kiln drying of material for airplanes became
imperative. The prime requisite was to find or develop methods of kiln drying which would
assure material of maximum strength properties. The problem of cutting the period of drying
to the minimum was not so important, as it was the opinion that a period of from one to two
months for the drying of such species a spruce woulJ answer, if necessary.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS.

For some 12 years previous to this time the Forest Service had been carrying on investigations of the best types of kiln con truction and methods of kiln operation to produce dry
stock of maximum quality. These investigation had re ulted in the inYention, patenting,
and dedication to public u e of a new type of dry kiln in which excellent control of the important
factors of temperature, humidity, and circulation could be secured . However, few of the
species of importance in airplane construction had been included in these kiln-clrying investigations. Also, the effort had been largely directed toward preventing the great 10 ses from
checking, casehardening, hollow-horning, and the like, which in many commercial drying
operations had been excessive; and consequently tests had not been made to determine
whether material having the maximum strength properties was being secured. However,
about the time the kiln-drying studies were first started a very carefully planned and executed
series of tests had been made to determine the effect, on strength, of exposure for various
periods of time to ill'y air fl.nd to steam, both at various temperatures and pr essures . These
experiments 1 were on loblolly pine, white ash, and red oak. Additional knowledge of the
effects of various temperatures ba.d been gained from the results of tests of material which
had been subjected to various steps involved in the application of preservative treatment.
Foreseeing the necessity for knowledge of the effect of kiln-drying operfl.tions on the strength
of airplane woods, the Forest Products Laboratory before the declaration of war arranged
to secure a quantity of partially air-dry spruce and white ash. Strength tests made on material
dried in three preliminfl.ry kiln runs with a range of temperatures and humidities, indicated
that spruce and ash could be successfully and safely kiln dried by using moderate temperatures and fairly high relative humidities, with careful control of kiln conditions. That material
might be seriously damaged in strength properties without displaying visible signs of deteri1

oration was also indicated. This denoted that perfection of appearance did not constitute
a safe criterion for the acceptance of material for exacting uses such as aircraft construction,
and emphasized the need for standardization of drying practice and the specifying of limiting
conditions to be used.
ADOPTION OF SPECIFICATIONS AND BEGINNING AND SCOPE OF PRESENT WORK.

With these tests and the previous experience of the laboratory in many lines as a basis,
Signal Corps Specification 20500 (now with some slight modification Bureau of Aircraft Production Specification 20500-A) was drawn up. The general problem of kiln drying airplane
stock, however, was by no means solved . Although the tests which had been made were
sufficiently extensive to form, in the existing emergency, a ba is of kiln.-drying specifications,
it was very desirable to get a further check upon their applicabili ty through additional tests.
It wtLs also, desirable to determine if it wo uld be possible to use conditions adapted to more
rapid drying. Moreover, there were a considerable number of species which were looked
upon as sui table substitu tes for spruce, ash, and the other woods which experience had already
shown to be adapted to aircraft construction. It was regarded as essential that safe methods
of drying these species be developed. In addition to this, the laboratory was undertaking
tests of numerous features of airplane construction and it was necessary to have dry material
for use in these tests.
The work has now covered 26 1 species, with approximately 100 kiln runs and with some
100,000 mechanical tests to determine the effect of the processes . It is tbe purpose of this
monograph to set forth in detail the methods used, to give in considerable fulhless the data
secured and conclusions drawn, and thus to 'm ake a,ailable information for the guidance of
those engaged in aircraft construction and others who may be interested in kiln drying wood
in such a manner as to retain the maximum strength.
BASIS OF TESTS AND COMPARISONS.

Since kiln drying was to take the place of extended periods of air seasoning, it was qut natural to adopt air drying as a basis by which to judge the effect of Jjln drying. It might seem to
one not well acquainted with the phenomena revealed by tests of strength properties of wood
that it would be feasible to kiln dry a giyen lot of material, make tests upon it, and compare
directly with the strength of air-dry material of the same species, as determined by previous
t ests. Such a method, it is true, might suffice to detect any severe damage or excessive deficiency in strength properties brought about by the drying processes. In the present experiments, however, the aim was to find kiln processes such that the resulting material would be
at leas t equal in strength properties to the same material had it been carefully air seasoned .
The decision as to whether this has been accomplished requires more exact comparisons than
call be obtained by the method given above. ,Also in such work it is desirable to be able to
distinguish small differences in the eITect of two or more different treatments in order to discover the tendency of a change in the treatments.
The study of data derived from some 130,000 tests on 129 different species of native woods
tested at the Forest Products Laboratory previous to the beginning of this- work has shown
something of the variabilit.y that may be expected . It has been found, for instance, that
even when as many as possible of the factors contributing to the variation of timber are und er
control, the average of material from a tree selected at random 'would be expected to differ
. from a true average of the species by from 7 to 15 per cent, depending upon which of several
important strength properties was considered. The variation of individual specimens is, of
course, much greater. Consequently, it is e sential to make certain that the material subjected to any treatment whose effect is to be found is as inherently like that with which it is
to be compared as possible. In other words, no very close estimate of the effect of kiln drying
upon the strength is possible from comparisons of the properties of two lots of material, one
being kiln dri ed and the other air dried, and both selected at I andom.

The problem presents two alternatives. One is to divide the green stock of a given tree
or trees into two lots, one of which is tested after kiln drying and the other after air drying.
This involves a delay in the anaiysis until the air drying is complete and the to ts mttcle, and was
deemed impracticable because of the demand for immediate information.
The second alternative is to make a comparison with the results previously obtained from
material of the same species and te ted in both the green and the air-dry conditions. On the
basis of this comparison a conclusion may be drawn as to whether kiln drying has produced as
favorable a change in properties as had been found, from the prenous tests, to result from air
drying. This second method is, of course, the best adapted to securing quick results. On the
other hand, it does not, for reasons which have been mentioned and which will be further discussed 1ater, justify as definite and certain conclusions as the first.
The plan actually followed was a combination of the two alternatives.
The material for testing was brought to the laboratory in log form, and was th.ore cut up
into three lots. The first was tested green, the second after kiln ch-ying, and the third after
thorough air seasoning. Methods of making this division are further di cussed uncleI' " Preparation ot Material."
As soon as the tests on kiln-dried material were available they were analyzed and preliminary
conclusions drawn from a comparison with previously air-dried material of the same species.
This can be safely done only on the part of those who are experienced and familiar with strength
values and particularly familar with the variations that are likely to be met with in stock of a
given species grown in different lucalities. If the kiln-dried material proves to be greatly uperior or greatly inferior it is safe to say positiv:ely that it would al 0 have been superior or inferior to stock of the same tree air dried. If, however, the differences turn out to be small and
less than the probable variation of an average of the strength property, definite conclusions are
not possible. This analysis is, therefore, regarded as preliminary and final conclusion are withheld until air-dry material from the same trees and parts of trees has been tested. The comparisons then possible are known to be free of some of the factors enumerated below and the
rest can be adjusted for or can be reduced in importance by working with a large number of
tests. Where this has been done the difference in strength properties between kiln-dried and
air-dried stock and between stock dried under different kiln conditions can be stated, with considerable assurance, to be due to differences in drying conditions only.
VAR IABLES AFFECTING RESULTS.

The factors which affect test results and contribute to their variability may be enumerated
as follows:
(1) Defects (knots, decay, shakes, etc.).
(2) Density.
(3) Species.
(4) Moisture content and distribution.
(5) ~ate of testing.
(6) Temperature at time of test.
(7) Position in tree.
(8) Tree characteristics (varying with locality of growth, soil, elevation, etc.).
(9) Unexplained variations (usually following the laws of probability) .
These factors must be so handled that their effects will not be mistaken for the effect of the
kiln-drying process. The effect of these factors are eliminated from cOl;nparisons in the following .
manner:
All pieces having visible defects which it is evident would lessen their strength are discarded at the outset. I nspection is also made after test, since some defects are likely not to be
revealed until the specimen has failed.
~egarding density and position in the tree, fairly general relations have been deduced from
the extensive investigations previously made. It is a general rule that the strength properties
of wood of any species vary directly as some power of the density; that the density, and therefore
the strength, decreases with height from ground at growth (spruce seems to be an exception to

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRE GTH 'OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

481

this); and that there is a considerable but unpredictable variation between strength and distance
from the pith of the tree. Provided the test specimens come from the same height in the tree
and the same region of annual growth, there does not seem to be much difference in strength
with regard to cardinal direction in the living tree.
It is evident, then, that the influence of density, position in tree, and tree characteristics
dm be eliminated from compari ons, as far as the kiln-drying work is concerned, by selecting
material for test in the green, kiln-dried, and air-dried conditions, not only from the same tree
but also from its corresponding parts. The existence of tree characteristics al 0 makes it desirable that several trees be represented in each kiln run. It is also found that unexplained
variations are such as to necessitate that each tree be represented in each group (green, air-dried,
and kiln-dried) by a considerable number of specimens.
The effect of moi ture content and distribution could be eliminated by bringing the kiln and
air-dried material to the same moisture content before test. Tllis, however, requires an
excessive amount of time and it is found more feasible to allow for comparatively small
differences in moisture content by making adjustments of the data. These adjustments will be
discussed later.
Differences in moisture content between parts of the same specimen are avoided by allowing
a period of air seasoning after the kiln dryinO', thus bringing the moi ture in the material to practically uniform distribution. Material which is air dried is not tested until it has reached a
practically constant weight and the moisture content has become approximately uniform.
The effects of rate of test and temperature at time of test are cared for by properly standardized testing methods.

The standard tests made on wood at the Forest Products Laboratory and the mechanical
properties determined from them are:

It may not appear necessary to perform all of these tests on the green, kiln-dried, and airdried material in order to get a sufficiently reliable ba. i for the determination of the e:ITcct of
kiln drying. On the other hand, it woulo. noL do to select one kind of test on OllO property
and as ume that if the kiln dried stock proved to be superior or inferior to air-clried, all
the other properties would also be superior or inferior. The several properties may ,ery
well, and do in fact, prove to be affected in different ways by the variou condilions of seasonillg.
This phenomenon i amply iUu trated by data presentecl later.
PROPERTIES ON WHICH ANALY IS IS BASED AND THEm SIC ' IFICANCE.

The analysis of the effect of kiln-drying is, therefore, based on the tests which bring
out the propmties deemed most important in airplane construction; namely, static and impact
bending and compression parallel to grain; although all of the to ts are made because the test
of lesser importance can be made at a comparatively low cost an 1 crvc at times as a check on
the conclusion reached from a study of the principal te t data.
The properties chosen for prin cipal attention in the analy is are five in number. They
are: Modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, and work to maximum load, obtained from
the static-bending test ; height of drop, obtailled from the impact-bending te t; and maximum
crushing strength, obtained from the compres ion-parallel-lo-grain test.
By modulus of rupture is meant the computed fiber tres in the outermost fiber of the
the beam at the maximum load. It is a measure of tho ability of a beam to support a
slowly applied load for a very short time. It is not a true fiber stress. since the formula
by which it is computed is exactly applicable only within Lhe ela tic limit. The term is. hm,'ever, univer ally accepted and the yalues are quite comparable for "Variou species lweI size
of lumber. It is, moreover, it definitely men.surahle quantity which does not depend to any
ex tent on any personal factor as does, for instance, fiber stress at elastic limit.
The modulus of elasticity is a measure of the stiffness or ri gi(lity, of a mn.terial, and i of
value in computing the deflections of joists, beams, and stringers, and safe loads for colunm .
. Although it is derived from the static bending te t it is' directly applicable to columns a well
as beams.
Work to maximum load represents the ability of a wooden part to absorb shock with a
slight permanent or semi-permanent deformation with some injury to the wood, and is a measure
of the combined strength and toughne s of a material under bending stl'es e. It is one of the
most important properties as far a airplane wooel is concerned.
Height of drop is the vertical fall of a 50-pound hammer causing eomplete failure under
the impact-bending test, and represents a quality that is important in members which are
occa. ion ally stressed beyond the elastic limit. It is a very variable quantity but rank with
work to maximum load in importance as a measure of the uitabilityof a wood for airplane use.
The value of maximum crushing strength, as obtained from the compres ion-parallel-tograin test, Jies in the possibili ty of estimating the strength of parts used as columns . It iF; a
very simple test and is frequently the only one used in studying the effect of a treatment or
process on wood. However, it does not necessarily follow that oLber are affected in the ame
way and, particularly not with respcct to the very important properties of work to maximum
load and height of drop . These latter are measures of touglmes ,or hock resistance, "'hieh
quality is not brought out hy the compression-pal'allel-to-grain te t. 1
The manner of conducting these and the minor tests and the significance of each of the
properties is discussed in various circulars and bulletins of the Forest ervice of the United
States Department of Agriculture.z

green and those from the other after air-drying.

after having been dried in the kilns. In general, half of the ticks of any given group- green, airdried, or from any kiln ruu-are te ted in tittic hending an(l half in impa t. Oue specimen
[rom each tick is te ted in compre ion parallel to grain. One-half of the stcLtic-bending

KILN DRYING AND TEST I G.

lfollowing the initial in 'poction Lhe material is placed in experimelltal kiln ' and dried. OIl
removal from the kilns it is torcd for a brief period, after 'which the tandard tests as previou ly
enumerated are made.
METHODS OF ANALYSIS.

We come now to a discu ion of the actual comparison of Lhe test data 011 material dried
under different kiln conlitions and in the air. Because of the several influencing factor which
have been enumerated, thi comparison can not be made directly from a table of propertie ill
which Lhese properties arc grouped a cording to the sea oning condition. 'rhe reason is thaI,
in the case of the preliminary analysi the air-dried stock u cd for eompari ' on was not inherently
like that kiln-dl'ied. The trees and the parts of the trees are neee arily different and the
10caliLie of growth are, in general, different also. In the final analy is the tests of the severa]
kiln runs and the air-dried were on matched stock; that is, on stock inherently the ame. Thus
the source of possible error in making a direct comparison introduced by unlike to·k fall away.
However, differences in moi ture content till usually exist at the time of test.
IMPROVEMENT HATlOS.

In attempting to find for use in the preliminary analysis some basi of compari on which
would, as far as possible, avoid the error resulting from inherenLly different material in the
groups compared, study of the available data showed that the change in propertie which i ·
produced by drying i, in general somewhat less variable than the strength values. Aecordingly.
it wa believed that the effect of kiln drying could be bettor judged by comparing the chn.nge
which it produced with the corresponding challge prodnced by air drying than by comparina
strength value of the kiln-dried and air-dried material. The mathematical measure of this
change is defined as an "improvement ratio."

Early te t of the effect of moi ture on the strength properties had hown that in 011e
species, at least, the effect of moisture change was I ractically independent of the pccific gravity
of the wood. On the other hand, the strength properties are very largely influenced by the
specific gravity. Although the relation of pecific gravity to strength has been the subject
of considerable study and important principle have been deduced, it i not possible to make
adjustment of strength figures for differences in peeific gravity with sufficient exactness for

the present purpose. H ence, it seem that comparisons are likely to be less aiIected by differences in specific gravity if ba ed on improvement ratins than if "based on the str ength propertie
th emsel ve~.
ADJ STMENT FOR DIFFERENCES OF MOISTURE CO TENT.

I n some in tances tho lrength propcrtie 0[' wood change very rapidly wiLh changes in
moisture.
orne strength propertie of some pecic arc nearly tripled in drying from the green
condition to about per cent moi ture. In other in Lance , how·ever, the trength properties
are decrea ed in drying. Aft r wood ha passed the fiber- aturation poin t,t a change of 1 per
cent in the moisturo content may produce as much a 7 or per cent chango in ·the · trength
value. Consequently, since it i impracti able to bring tho ,ariou group of material which
are to be compared to the arne moisture on tent before te t, it is e ential to the accuracy of
comparisons that careful attention be givon to adju tml' nt of strength value for difference of
moisture content.
everal year ago a rather comprehen ive tudy of the relation of moi ture content to tho
trength of wood wa carried out by tho Forest ervice at l aboratorie then maintained at
Yale Univer ity.2 Thi investigation, however, covered comparatively few pecics, and not all
the strength propertie of these. In taking up tho analy i of the data on the effect of kiln
drying on strength, tho need of a general moisture- trength law which would be applicable to
all pecies and all properties became apparent. For the purpose of developing such a l aw the
oxi ting data were very carefully reviewed.
Figure 2, taken from Fore t e1'\'ice Bulletin 70, illu trates the relation betv,een moi ture
and several strength propertie of red spruce. The graph for modulu of rupture i seen to be a
,curve from zero to about 30.5 per cent moi ture, beyond which it i a traight horizontal line.
Tili how that as moisture increa e trength decreases until a point is roached where there i
no further clecrea e. This point (30.5 per cent in thi case) i termed the fiber- aturation point.
At this point the cell wall are completely aturatecl, but there is no free or exces water in the
pores of the cells.
In studying data as gi\en in Forest ervice Circular 10 and Forest enice Bulletin 70 on
the several species a nd properties, it was found that ·w hen tho logarithm of the str ength property
wa plotted again t the percentage moi ture the point could be averaged, with but comp ar atively little error, by a. traight line. Thi ' was so con i tently true that the application of the
principle involved to other pecies and to other properties was thought to bo justified. r e
1'h
relation as found may be tated mathematically as follo"- :
= Ox lOAM
where is tho strength value at any moisture content, M, below Lhe liber- aLuration point, and
a and A are ompirieal factor . It ha been a urn cd that the tYI e of curyo represented by the
above equation is applicable to all properties, to all pecie, and to all drying conditions. Th
difIerence between the e variou curve ar repre ented hy th ~onstant (0 and A) which
clclapt the typ equation to pecific in Lance' . Theso constants for llny specifi.c ca 0 aro dprivecl

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF ArRFLANE WOODS .

489

It is not the function of this monograph to discuss kiln-drying schedule; consequently only
such data concerning the drying in these experimental runs as is essential to an understanding
and interpretation of the re ults of the strength tests are included. Neither is it intended that
the variou' graphs of kiln conditions should furnish comparisons of the variou::> proce es with
re pect to rate of drying. Por such di cu sions and comparisons the reader is referred to a
monograph by II. D. Tiemann entitled "The Kiln Drying of Wood for Airplanes" and published a one of this seri es. It is also desired to emphasize the fact that the runs described
herein were exp erimental and arc not presented as models, nor necessarily as recommended
practice.
SITRA SPRUCE.

Becau e of the importance of Sitka pruce as an airplane material, more experimental
kiln drying has been done on this species than on any other. The results of 13 kiln runs made
with different combinations of temperature, humidity, circulation, and other factors which may
affect strength proper tie are available for analy is . The first three runs are those which have
been previously mentioned as preliminary. These runs were made on partially air-dried
rough plank. Because of the fact that the material tested was quite limited in amount, ancl
the further fact that the other run have fumi hed much more comprehensive elata, it is unneces ary to present the data on these, preliminary run .
SOUHCE OF MATERIAL.

THE AIR DRYING.

Material of hipmenL 504, matching that kiln dried in rUIlS 88, 89, 91, 93, Md 94, was air
drIed in the form of sticks 21 by 2~ inches by 4 feet, the end being carefully paraffined to prevent end drying. It wa dried for about one year, from midsummer 1917 to mid;mmmer 1918
in 11 shed without artificial heat. The shed was open on the north and clo ed on the other three
. ides. The specimen were piled about 7 feet abo,'c the ground, midway between the ground
and the roof of the shee1. The conditions thus ecured were considered as favorable for perfect
air ell'ying as are obtainable. When stored for drying the average moi ture content of the group
of sticks matching two of the kiln runs (88 and 89) was about 49.1 per cent, and for another
group of sticks matching] iln runs 91, 93, and 94 about 41.5 per cent. Thc final moisture contents, u,fter the material u,ppeared to have reached con tant weight, as indicated by periodic
weighincr of sample, were found to be ,ery uniform and omewhat higher than wa anticipated.)
For six samples they were 14.0,14.3,14.2,14.3,14.3, and 14.5 per cent, gi\'ing an average of 14.3
per cent. The moi ture at the time of teot was nearly 2 per cent less, inee somc time nece arily
elap ed from the time of ]'C'moval from the drying shC'd, during which time the stick.s were stored
indoors in n, warmer and drier atmo phere.

Table 2 pre ents ratios derived from the proper tie of material of shipments 325 and 504
as presr:mted in Table 1. Ratio are given both with and without adju tment for moisture
content. The next table (Table 3) was made up for the rea on that the original data showed
a con i tent variation in the trength properties according a the test pecimen eame from
near the central or the outer portions of the tree. It wa thought that better comparison
between kiln-dried, green, and air-dried material would he had by using smaller unit of matching- that is, by group more inherently alike. 'rable 3 gives by inner and outer portions the
properties of each bolt. (" OuLer:" and " inner " portion are divided by the circumferential
plitting lines as illustrated in fig. 1 (E ).) The improvement ratios included are ba ed on
average values of properties of bolts.

EFFEOT 01" IULN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

Improvement ratios based on a still further subdivision of the unit for matching are shown
in Table 4. These are derived from some of the values shown in the preceding tn.ble. Only
the extreme lower and upper bolts from among those available are included, so that the trees
2 and 3, having only the bolts e-f, are not represented. Tables 3 and 4 serve the purpose of
detecting differences, if any exist, between the effect of drying on material from different part
of the trees, and are useful in supporting the conclusions reached from the study of ratios based
on the general properties shown in Table 2.

The improvement ratios for material from hipments 563 and 57

(Table 5), for which

the air-dried material is not yet ready for test, are obtained in a somewhat different manner.
The ratios are computed for individual double bolts, but without ubdivi ion into inner and
outer portions for each kiln run. The average for the ratios for the several bolts are then
regarded a the improvement ratio corre poneling to the kiln run. The ratios were 0 deriyed
for kiln runs 147, 14 ,163 , 171, and 172, and are shown in Table 5.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

the excellence of the kiln-dried material is general
with respect to all of the five properties.
The conclusions as to the relative merits of the
various kiln runs are:
(1 ) Of the two runs 88 and 89 made on the
same group of material, 9 is the poorer, although it
is better than the corresponding air-dry except in compression parallel, and possibly also in height of drop.
(2) In the other group of material (including
runs 91, 93 , and 94) kiln run 94 shows, with most consistency, the highest improvement ratio. Taking all
the properties into consideration, it is difficult to choose
between runs 91 and 93. If, however, we base a decision on the highly important properties of work to
maximum load and height of drop, it would be concluded that run 91 is the better, in spite of the higher
temperature used throughout the run.
I t will be noticed that the air-dried material of
the group matching runs 88 and 89 shows about the
same improvement over green as does that of the
group matching runs 91, 93, and 94, and that they
differ considerably less from each other than they do
from the air-dry of the previous shipment, 325. The
property which is an exception to this statement is
the very variable and less important one of modulus
of elasticity. This brings out the point that, while
the relative suitability of the several kiln runs can be
determined by intercomparison of the improvement
ratios, it is not possible to state positively that any
of them give improvements equal or superior to those
to be obtained by air drying until matched air-dried
material has actually been tested. To illustmte: If
tests on the air-clJ:ied groups matching kiln runs 8 ,
89, 91, 93, and 94 were not available, and judgment
of these runs had to be based on a comparison of their
improvement ratios with those of the previously tested
air-dry of shipment 325, and without any allowance
for variability, the conclusion would be reached that
of these runs 94 alone had yielded stock equal or
superior to air-dry. It is now evident that such a
comparison would be misleading. It so happens that
in this instance this method of comparison is safe, in
that it does not give a false idea concerning the safety
of kiln-drying. On the other hand, it might happen
that such a comparison would lead to the conclusion
that a given drying process was entirely safe, when
such was not the case. However, in making such
comparisons careful consideration must be given to
the variations to be expected. This was done in the
first analysis of the effect of runs 88, 89,91,93, and 94,
and the conclusion was reached that, with the possible
exception of run 89, all had given satisfactory results.
That all the runs, 89 included, have given satisfactory results is indicated by the data presented herein.

The above conclusions have b een arrived at by a consideration of the r atios shown in
figures 8 and 9, mentally balancing a deficiency in one property against superior excellence in
another. While it is necessary to exercise care in any attempt to r educe comparisons to an
exact mathematical basis, it is interesting to note how comparisons on such a basis lead to
practic~ny the same conclusions as given. T able 6 1 gives the results of a computation of the
" efficiencies" of the various runs.

Table 6 is derived from figure and with its footnotes is self-explanatory. The arrangement of kiln runs in order of descending weighted average efficiencies as obtained from Table 6
is as follows:

runs except 89 gave results superior to air drying.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Tables 7 and 8 present data similar to those of Table 6, but derived from figure 9. They
show efficiency figures for various smaller groups of material. Tables 7 and ,as would be
expected, disclose considerably greater variations than are shown in Table 6. The averages
naturally show variations from tho e of Table 6. In no case, however, is the drop of the e
ome rather low "efficiencies" for individual properties
averages below 100 per cent serious.
are found among these figures for smaller group of material. It is notable, however, that
there are few cases in which both work to maximum load and drop, or both modulus of rupture
and maximum crushing trength, fall low. It is doubtful a1 0 whether such variations as are
found in the e tables can be suppo ed to be the result of the kiln processes . It i more probable that they result from actual inherent diIference~ between the kiln-dried and air-ill-ied
material. Such differences are more likely to occur between small groups than between large
ones. In other words, the differences between small groups of tests are likely to have little
meaning, and conclusions as to the effect of the kiln proce ses can best be reached from consideration of the larger groups.
Table 6, then, leads to the following conclusions, which are practically the same as those
previously stated:
1. Runs 88, 91, 93, and 94 have produced material equal or superior to material that was
air-dried.
2. Run 9 is probably the poorest of the runs, but may be considered practically equal
to the air-ill-y.
From J: os. 1 and 2 would follow:
3. Within the limits used, 115 0 to 1 0 0 F., the trength properties of itka spruce are
independent of the temperature of drying (but see folloviTing paragraph).
As has been mentioned, it is to be expected that a given process or set of drying conditions
will have a different eIfect on different groups of material from the same species, and that it
may be possible for a process to be safe for one group and very damaging to another. This
expectation has been fulfilled in thi series of tests, and consideration of some of the runs yet
to be discu sed necessitates a considerable modification of conclu ion No.3 above.
DISCUSSION OF RUNS FOR waICH DATA ON MATCHED AIR-DRIED MATERIAL ARB NOT YET AVAILABLE.

Con ideration is now to be given to material from additional kiln runs. Air-dried material
matched to that ill-ied in the e runs and te ted i not yet available for test.
Runs 147 and 148.- Two of the e runs (147 and 148) are particularly worthy of
attention.
Run 147 was made on piece 2t by 2t inches in section, by 4 feet long. The temperature
was 130 0 F. at the beginning and 150 0 F. at the end. The humidity and steaming treatments
were so regulated as to keep casehardening at a minimum. Run 148 was on material from the
same logs as run 147; material was in the form of wide planks 2! inches thick and the temperatures were 160 0 F. initial and 1 0 0 F. final.
Strength data for these runs are given in Tables 1 and 9. Improvement ratios are shown
in Table 5 and in figure . These improvement ratios are based on all the material in each
run as compared to corresponding green material, and serve for a general comparison of the e
two with other runs.

Figures better suited to the comparison of runs 147 and 148 are given in Table g. Improvement ratios derived from them are given in Table 10 and graphed in figure 10. These
data differ from those of Tables 1 and 5 and figure chiefly in that run 147 included no material
from the central portions of the various bolts, so that in making Tables 9 and 10 and figure 10
tests on material from such central portions dried in run 14 were excluded in order to get the
best possible comparison of the two runs.

Comparisons of runs 147 and 148 (see fig. 10) in modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity,
and maximum crushing strength are erratic when individual bolts are considered, but 148
G!Verages better than 147 in each of these properties. I n work to maximum load and height of
drop, the results are (contrary to those for small groups from the nillS previou ly considered)
consistent and quite largely in favor of run 147. This leads to the conclusion that run 148

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

damaged the material in work to maximum load and height of drop 1 as compared to similar
material tested after drying in run 147.
That the results of run 147 are in all probability entirely satisfactory is concluded from com.
parison with the groups of air-dried material (fig. 8)2.
Runs 163, 171, and 172.-Runs 171 and 172 compare very favorably with the other runs
and with groups of air-dried material, except in height of drop, where they seem to be quite low.
Run 163 seems to fall below runs 171 and 172, and, in fact, below a number of the
groups of material graphed in figure 8. No definite conclusions concerning these runs can be
drawn until the corresponding air-dried material has been tested.
GE ERAL COMPARISON OF RUNS.

Table 11 affords a means of comparing all runs. It is made up in a manner similar to
Table 5, except that it gives for each run a weighted average improvement ratio instead of a
weighted average" efficiency." "Efficiency" figures can not, of course, be obtained in advance
of tests on corresponding air-dried material.
Table 11 indicates practically the same thing as has been brought out previously with
respect to the relative merits of several of the kiln runs. It docs not, however, indicate an
appreciable diil'erence between runs 147 and 14. It indicates that 163 is the poorest of an,
and rather distinctly inferior to air-dried material. Very probably the apparently very poor
results on run 163 are only an example of variability explainable through the fact that run 163
was on different material from the other runs. Runs 163, 171 , and 172 were made on material
from the same shipment, but 171 and 172 involved other trees than 163. Figures such as are
given in Table 11 furnish quite accurate comparisons between two or more groups of material
from the same trees. Comparisons between groups of material from different tl'ees must,
however, be modified to take into account the variations which are likely to occur.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
PHOTOGRAPHS OF FAILURES.

Plates I to IX, inclusive, show failures of impact-bending sticks from various kiln runs
and from some air-dried material. Plates I, II, and III, pertaining to run 148, are of particular
interest. The possible value and interest of such photographs was not suggested until the
time of the testing of these sticks. It is unfortunate that similar photographs from earlier runs,
particularly 147, are not available.
Of the failures shown in Plate I more than one-third would be judged to be of the highest
type and in no way indicative of the brashness shown by the data of Tables 9 and 10 and figure 10. In Plate II but one or two of the failures are at all indicative of brashness, and it is
. difficult to believe that this material has been injured. That such is the case, however, seems
to be very definitely shown by the test results. All but one, or possibly two, of the failures
shown in Plate III are indicative of very poor material.
Plates IV to VII show failures of sticks from runs 171 and 172, and of corresponding green
sticks. Failures of air-dried sticks corresponding to kiln runs 8 and 89 are shown in Plate VIII,
and to runs 91, 93, and 94 in Plate IX. Comparison of these various photographs fails to indicate any difference between the air-dried and kiln-dried material with respect to types of
failure.
Plates I, II, and III as brought out by the comment on them and comparison with the
strength data show that reliable conclusions as to the eHed of kiln drying can not be attained
by inspection of failures.
RESUME FOR SITKA SPRUCE.

Because of the importance of itka spruce as an airplane material, and in order to set forth
the methods of analysis used and to illustrate the difficulties met and the caution necessary in
making such an aniJysis, the data on Sitka spruce have been discussed in greater detail than is
considered necessary for the other species.
Data concerning ] 0 kiln runs are presented. These 10 runs include 5 runs, material
from which is compared to matched material tested after ail drying, and 5 for which data on
matched air-dried material are not available.
It is shown conclusively that Sitlca spruce can be 7ciln dried 'without loss of strength as compared
to air drying.
In connection with this and other conclusions stated in this report it is desired to call attention to the fact that the material which was kiln dried is compared to material air dried under
conditions probably much more favorable to good results than is ordinarily the case. This
material was also air dried in small sticks (2t by 2t inches in cross-section). . This procedme
is undoubtedly more favorable to the retention of maximum strength than is air drying in wider
planks, as is ordinarily done. Tn fact, cas'ehardening of sticks of this size was pmposely
attempted in one kiln run (uot discussed herein) but without success.
Data on the first five runs fail to disclose any consistent relation between the temperatmes
used in drying and the strength of the resulting material, and taken by themselves would lead
to the conclusion that temperatmes up to 130 0 F. can be safely used. There is, however, quite
conclusive evidence of damage to material dried in one of the other runs made with temperatmes between 160 0 and 1 0 0 F. Taken as a whole, therefore, the data presented do not justify
the use of temperatmes as high as 160 0 F. Definite evidence as to what is the critical temperatme which should never be exceeded is not afforded.
It is believed, however, that the data presented justify the conclusion that the tempemtures of
specification 20500-A (120 0 F. initial to 145 0 F. final) are entirely safe.
There is no evidence of the extreme brashness which has been claimed to result from kiln
drying.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

Because of the possibility of damage from higher temperature and the fact that as the
scheduled temperature is increased the danger of damage through accidental departure from
schedule increases, it is recommended that the temperatures of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A
(see Appendix A of Report No. 65, "Kiln Drying of Wood for Airplanes") be not exceeded
in the drying of Sitka spruce for airplane stock.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STR;ENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

DOUGLAS FIR.
SOURCE OF MATERIAL.

The material for the four experimental runs on Douglas fir ,vas derived from 10 trees
which were grown along the lower Columbia River, in Clatsop County, Oregon, at an elevation
of about 1,500 feet. Each tree was represented by two -foot logs, an upper bolt (h-i, i-j, or
m-n) and a lower bolt (a-b), making in all twenty 8-foot bolts. The logs varied in size from
31 inches to 39 inches in diameter and were from 300 to 350 years old. This material constituted shipment 523.
The logs were sawed into 2-inch and 3-inch planks of various \vidths. Specimens for test
in the green and air-dried conditions were obtained from two flitches extending from side to
side and nearly through the center of each -foot log. (See fig. 1 (B ).) The sticks from each
-foot bolt were grouped as outlined on page 15.
The remaining material was divided among the four kiln runs. Figure 1 CB) is an example
showing how planks for test after kiln drying were selected. Figure 1 CD) shows how these
planks were divided into test specimens and how the latter were marked. Table 12 is a
schedule showing the distribution of material from these 10 tlees among the four kiln runs.
Previously tested green and air-dried material, with which comparisons are made, was secured
from two trees from shipment 315, two from shipment 31 , and one from shipment 354.
These shipments were from Lewis County, Wash" Lane County., Oreg., and Humboldt County,
Calif., respectively.

DESCRIPTION OF KILN-DRYING CONDITIONS.

Figure 11 is a graphical representation of the kiln conditions and of the moisture contents
of samples of the stock for the four runs 99, 101, 102, and 103.
In every case material went into the kiln soon after cutting from the log and before any
appreciable drying had occurred.
Kiln run 99.- The charge for run 99 consisted of two hundred twenty-nine 2 by 3 inch, 4
by 5 inch, and 3 by 4 inch pieces. Arrangement of the kiln was practically the same as shown
in figme 7 (kiln run 147), except that the stock was flat-piled with 2 to 3 inches between the
pieces in each layer. Two-inch stickers were used.
After a preliminary steaIning at 130 0 F. for four hours, drying was started at 120 0 F. and
about 90 per cent relative huInidity. Temperatllre and huInidity were gradually changed, as
shown by the curves, to about 125 0 F. and 55 per cent huInidity at the end of the run.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVI DRY CO IMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
THE AIR DRYING.

Te t pecimen 2t by 2t inches by 4 feet, matching the variolJil kiln runs, were air dried
for about eight months, from February, 191 , to October, 191 , under practically the same
conditions as similar itka spruce specimens ( ee p. 25), when they were found to have r eached
practically constant weight. The average moisture content at time of storing was about 31
per cent. The moi ture contents of the amples at the end of the air-drying periods were
about 12 per cent.
STRENGTH DATA.

T able 13 gives the average mechanical properties of the green and air-dried Douglas fir
previously te ted (shipments 315, 31 , and 354); and also-by butt and upper bolt classesof material from kiln run 99 and 101, and from runs 102 and 103, with green and air-dry to
match each pair of kiln runs'.

DISCUSSIO •

Inspection of figure 14 indicates' that of the four kiln runs, 101 alone has gIven results
which can be considered fully equal to air drying. This run falls below the correspouding
air-dried material in three instances: Modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, and work to
maximum load, all for material from upper bolts. 'l'he deficiencies. in these instances are 0
sman that they aTe entirely oiIset by superior excellence in other res1 ects.
Further inspection shows that run ] 02 is very consistently, modulus of elasticity being the
only exception, inferior to the cOlTesponding air-dry, and is, upon the whole, the poorest of
the four runs. 'l'hese conclusions are supported by the figures presented in Table 15. Air
drying is taken as the standard of efficiency, or 100 per cent. The efficiencies of air drying
and of the several kiln runs, the latter as obtained by averaging the figures of Table] 5 (A)
with those of Table 15 (B), are as follows:

Reference to figure 11 sho \VS that the above lis t is in order of increasing temperatures; i. e.,
as temperature increases, efficiency decreases.
If the values for efficiency with respect to work to maximum load and maximum drop
only, as given in Table 15 (A) and (B), be averaged (without weighting) we getPor cent.

The order is as before, and the deficiency i~ less in runs 99 and 103, but somewhat greater
in run 102.
These figure all point to a rather definite relation between strength properties and the
temperatures used in drying. In no case is the deficiency sufficient to be considered an obstacle
to the use of such material for ordinary purposes. However, any failure to equal air-dried
material must be looked upon with considerable suspicion when stock is to be used for aircraft
construction.
Tests of the effect of various steps of preservative treatment on Douglas HI' have shown
that this species is especially susceptible to injury by high temperatures. Data on such tests,
together with those given herein, furnish the following for correlation of temperature and

AN UAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUT)CS.

The rlata on the four kiln runs as given in Table 15 (A) and (B) and as presented in figure] 5
indicate that 120 0 F. is about the critical temperature for Douglas fir in the green state. The
data drawn from Bulletin No.2 G by showing a continual rlecrease of strength properties with
increase in temperature support this indication.
CONCLUSIO S .

In view of the points brought out in the above discussion these conclusions are reached:
(1) There is a quite definite relation between the strength properties of Douglas fir and the

temperatures used in drying it. (2) About 120 0 F. is the critical temperature above which
damage is likely to result. (3) The decrease of strength properties with increase in temperature
is grafl.ual. (4) The maximum damage to be expected from the use of Table 1 of Specification

FIG. 15.-Relntion between strength properties of Douglas fir and temperature appUed to the green wood.

20500-A does not exceed 5 per cent. In all probability the susceptibility to damage by heat
decreases as the moisture content decreases, so that even this damage is not really to be expected.
(5) When maximum safety is desired, as for aircraft material, it seems doubtful if the temperature of 120 0 F. should be exceeded before the material is reasonably dry. (6) It is to be
expected tha.t Table 2 of Specification 20500-A will produce material fully equal to th~t air dried.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

It is recommended that the temperature of Table 2 of Specification 20500-A should not be
exceeded in drying Douglas fu· for maximum strength value. Humidities used should be such
as to keep checking and casehardening to a minimum. Steaming as permitted by Specification
20500-A would be expected to have no harmful effect.

WESTERN WIDTE PINE.
SOURCE OF MATERIAL.

Four experimental kiln runs have been made on material from two shipments of logs.
Shipment 488, which furnished stock for kiln runs 95 and 110, consisted of logs from 24 trees
cut in Idaho. These log were 10 to 20 inches in diameter and too knotty to be considered of
airplane grade. Test specimens were, however, so selected as to be unaffected by the defects
and were repre entative of the clear wood.
Shipment 570 furnished stock for kiln runs 149 and 150. This shipment on i ted of
seventeen 16-foot butt logs sent to the Laboratory from Keeler, Idaho. These were of beLter
quality than the previou shipment and were 1 to 36 inches in diameter.
Data on these two shipments are compared with data from green and air-dried material
from one log of hipment 224. This shipment came from Mi soula County, Mont., and was
.
tested prior to the beginning of the present series of tests.
CUTTING OF STOCK.

• The logs of shipment 488 were cut into 8-foot bolts, which were subdivided similarly
to the logs of commercial white ash. (See fig. 10.) The resulting planks were cut into 2 by
3 inch, 2 by 4 inch, 2 by 5 inch, and 3 by 4 inch tock.
Table 16 shows how the material was divided for drying in two kiln rtm .
The 16-foot logs of shipment 570 were sawed in a manner imilar to that shown for Douglas
fir in figure 1 (B). Material for test green and after air drying was derived from a 2t-inch
flitch extending through the center of each log. Half of the remaining material from each log
was dried in the form of 2t-inch planks, of variou widths and 16 feet long.
DESCRIPTIO.N OF KILN DRYING CONDITIONS.

Figure 16 shows graphically the kiln conditions and the moisture conLents of samples of
stock for the four runs 95, 110, 149, and 150.
Run 95.-The charge consisted of 2 by 3 inch, 2 by 4 inch, 2 by 5 inch, and 3 by 4 inch
piece derived from shipment 4 8. (See Table 16.) The arrangement of the kiln wa much
as for run 147 of Sitka spruce ( ee fig. 7), except that the material was flat piled. The piling
was open (2-inch stickers and 2t to 3 inchc between the pieces in the layers), with the 2-inch
stock on top of the 3-inch.

ANNUAL. REPORT NATIONAL ADVI ORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The run was begun with 4t hours' preliminary steaming at 90 0 to 135 0 F. Temperatures
find humidities were as shown in figure 16. The irregularities in these factors during the first
few days were due to derangement of controlling apparatus. As shown by the curves of figure
16, the samples of 2-inch stock reached a satisfactory dryness and it was removed from the
kiln three days ahead of the 3-inch stock.
Considerable trouble was experienced from lack of uniformity in drying. This was largely
due to wide variations in the initial moisture content of different pieces and to apparently
nonuniform distribution of moisture lenthwise of individual pieces.

FIG. 16.-Kiln conditions for western white pine, kiln runs 95 and 110 (shipment 4 ) a nd 149 a nd 150 (shipment 570).

Some slight evidence of casehardening was found near the end of the run. It was not
sufficient, hO'wever, to necessitate steaming.
Run li O.-The charge for this run, as for 95, was of 2 by 3 inch, 2 by 4 inch,2 by 5
inch, and 3 by 4 inch pieces derived from shipment 488 (see T able 16). Arrangement of the
kiln and piling of stock was quite similar to r un 95. Spaces between pieces in the layers were,
however, only one-half to three-fourths of an inch.
After preliminary steaming at 135 0 F. for 18 hours, drying conditions were establisherl
and continued as shown by figure 16. As in r un 95, considerable trouble was experienced
because of nonuniformity of moisture distribution in the charge. This condition obtained both
at the beginning and at the end of the run. The closer piling was perhaps in part responsible
for the longer drying period than in run 95. F urthermore, because of the very high moisture

content of one sample, ra.ising of temperature and lowering of humidity were delayed longer
than in run 95.
Run 149.- The charge consisted of 3 by 3 inch, 3 by 5 inch, and 3 by 8 inch pieces, 16 feet
in length, derived from shipment 570. Material was flat piled on 1! -inch stickers with 2-inch
spaces.
The very long time required for this run is due largely to the fact that it was made in an
experimental kiln in which a fall circulatory system had been devised and which had not yet
been renderod controllable. Circulation was very poor and resulted in nonuniformity of temperature between different parts of the kiln. Slight casehardening was relieved by steaming for
one hour at 1 50 F. on the tbirtieth day. No ca ebardening was evident at the close of the run.
Run 150.-The charge consisted of 3 by 3 inch, 3 by 4 inch, and 3 by 5 inch pieces, 16 feet
in length and of various widths, derived from shipment 570. The material was close-piled on
a slant, with 1 ~-inch stickers. Material was steamed for one hour· on two occasions at 180 0
and 174 0 F., respectively, to relie.e caseharcleriing. Slight casehardoning was present when the
material was removed from the kiln.
Am DRYING.

Material was stored for air drying under conditions similar to those for Sitka spruce an'd
Douglas fir, as previously described.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYI "G ON STRENGTH' OF AIRPLANE WOODS.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS.

As mentioned on page 20, western white pine is to be u ed as an example of the two methods
of analysis:
1. First or preliminary analysis ba ed on comparison of kiln-dried and previou ly air-dried
material by means of the increa e in strength propertie produced by kiln drying as compared
to the previously observed increase from air drying.
2. Second analysi ba ed on comparison of matched kiln and aU'-dried material.
FIRST ANALYSIS .

As the example of this fiTst analy is, the discussion, conclusions, and recommendations
substantially as given in a report made when the data of Table 1 9 and figure 1 only were
available will be repeated here.
Discussion.-Figure 18 shows that the improvement in strength properties produced by kiln drying, with the
exception of work to maximum load, is practically as great as is secured by air drying as determined by previous tests
from a single tree.

FIG. 18.-lmprovement ratios for comparison of kiln runs 95 and 100 with air-dried stock of a previous shipment (shipment 224), western white pine.

Apparently' air drying produced in the material of this one tree exceptional improvement in work to maximum
load. This pelief is supported by the fact that in most if not all cases other coniferous woods have shown l ess increase
in this property. Also the actual values for work to maximum load for the air-dried material of this one tree is higher
than for any other coniferous species except the very heavy and dense ones, such as longleaf pine. Furthermore, it
is the general, but not invariable, rule that deflection to maximum load should decrease in air drying. Data on
deflections to maximum load are given in Table 20.

ANNUAL REPORT NATlO

AL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

From the foregoino- it is concl uded that the increa e in work to maximum load obtained from the one tree previously
air dried is abnormal and that the improvement of the kiln-dried material in this respect ha probably been as great as
would have resulted had the ame material been air dried .
Conclusions.-It is co nclud ed, then, that in all probability runs 95 and no haye produced as good results as would
have resulted from air drying the same material. The conditions in these runs were less severe than permitted by
pecification 20500-A in that the pecification admits of l ower humiditie than were u ed near the end of the run.
IIoweyer, the high humiditie maintained until the end of the runs (in no because of the very high moisture content of
a sino-Ie sample) are not beli eved e ential to the preservation of strength properties. A lower humidity wou ld perhaps
have shortened the time of drying somewhat. Dat:1. on material dried in accordance with pecification 20500-A are
not yet avail able.
The dinlcul ty experi nced in these runs through large variations in moistLU'e content of the stock , and through drying two thicknesse together, empha izes the desirability of classifying material on the basis of moisture content and size,
and of drying each cla separately. A rough moisture cla ification such as could be obtained by "hefting " each
piece as loaded into the kiln would probably expedite the drying.
Rrcommendations.-H is recommended:
1. That, until additional data on the effect of various te mperatures and humidities on the strength of western white
pine can be obtained, Table 1 of Specifi cation 20500-A be used for drying thi species.
2. That consideration be given to grouping material into two or more classes on the basis of moisture content, and
t) drying material of but one moisture content class in the same kiln charge or placing the material containing the most
water in the fastest-drying portion of the kiln .
SECO D ANALY IS.

Discussion of runs 95 and 110.- Referring now to figure 17, it is seen that material from kiln
runs 95 and 110 excels matched air-dried material in all propertie except work to maximum load .
This i' Lhe property in which the kiln-dried material seemed to fall short when the fu· t analy is
was made. However, this shortage is believed to be entirely offset by the uperiority in drop
values and in other properties.
In faet, almost any reasonable weighting of properties and umming up of the effect of drying on the properties as a whole shows that the two kiln runs have been practically equal in their
effect, and have produced results fully as good as air drying.
Th e difference between runs 95 and 110 and the corresponding groups of air-dried material
are in all probability not a result of the different methods of seasoning, but are actual inherent
difference in material, impossible to avoid.
Discussion of 1'Uns 149 and 150.- In the ab ence of air-dried material corresponding to runs
149 and 150 it is not po sible, of cour e, to make po itive statement. in regard to their effect.
By comparison with the improvement in the air-dried material of shipment 224 and 4
the re ults of the e two runs seem quite satisfactory. Moreover, the lack of any con i tent or
apparently appreciable superiority of one run over the other, material for the two run having
been secured from the same trees and being very much alike (compare " green to match kiln
run 149" with "green to match kiln run 150," Table 17), indicates practical equality.
This equality, taken together with the fact that run 149 was at a considerably higher temperature than 150, might also be taken as an indieation that, up to the limits of run 149, no damage
from high temperatures was to be expected. Cautionmu t beob erved here, hoI' ever. It is indicated by the long period required for drying in run 149, and al 0 hown by records of this run, that
circulation was not good. The natural aceompaniment of poor circulation is nonuniformity of
temperature in different parts of the kiln. Hence it is entirely po ible that orne of the material
tested may not have been subjected to as severe temperature condition as are indicated in
figure 16.
It must be said that, in general, the kiln drying of western white pine in these run has not
been eminently sati facLory. Thi is attributed la1'g ly to the character of the material with
1'e pect to moisture content. As has been mentioned, moi ture content has been found to be
very nonuniform.
Conclusions.- It is beli eved that the data presented herein justify the following concIu ion :
1. We tern white pine can be kiln dried without damage to strength properties.
2. Table 1 of peeifieation 20500-A can be depended on to dry western white pine without
damage to strength properties.
R ecommendations.- It is recommended that, pending the results of further tests, the temperatures of peci:fication 20500-A be not exceeded in drying western white pine, and that the
humidity and steaming be regulated to keep easehardening to a minimum.

COMMERCIAL WHITE ASH.'

Eight kiln runs (81, 82, 83, 90; 96, 97, 92, and 100) have been made on white ash to show
the effect of drying under various combinations of temperatures and humidities.
SOURCE OF MATERIAL.

Shipment 499 consisted of partially air-dried rough planks furnished by one of the airplane
companies. This furnished material for runs 81, 82, and 83, which included both ash and Sitka
spruce and are previously mentioned as "preliminary runs."
Shipment 505 consisted of one log from each of 33 trees from southeastern Arkansas.
Three logs were 12 feet long and the remainder 16 feet. Top diameters ranged from 13 to 23
inches and the average total taper from top to butt of log was 6~ inches.

The absen e Ol complete data. i. e., green and air-dried matching that kiln dried ; on run

have produced with that produced in air drying the other groups. Proceeding on thi ba is,
it i seen that 3 i normal or above normal in nJl respect , while 1 and 2 are quite low in
work to maximum load, and 2 is lory low in drop. (ee Table 22 and fig. 22.) It is concluded
that 3 ha in all probability produced a good 1'0 ults a would be ecured from air drying,
but that 1 and 2 have failed to give good results in work and drop valu which are mea ures
of hock-ab orbing ahility and of great importance in airplane material.
Careful crutiny of Tables 22 and 23 and figUl'c 22 shows that runs 90, 96, 97, 92, and 100
are all fully equal to the corre ponding air-dried material in the important properties" work to
maximum load" and " drop"; that all oxcopt 90 are equnl OJ' uperior to air-dried in modulus of
elusticity; and that 96 only is fully equal to the air-dried in modulus of rupture and maximum
crushlng strength. Furthermore, run 90 falls "ery COIl. idorahly below air dried in these latter
prupert.ies. A resume of the aboi'o amounts to thi :
l. Th:1t the apparent "efficiency" of the kiln drying as shown in figure 32 and Table 24
is greatest for those properties which are least aiTectod by changes of moisture content-work to
maximum load, drop, and moduJus of elasticity-and least for those properties which are most
inft.uenced by changes of moisture content-modulus of rupture and maximum crushing strength.

FIG. 22.-Improvemeot ratios adjusted to 10 per cent moisture for comparing teo kilo runs

525

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AlRPLANE WOODS.

<)
That the run (90) showing the lowest apparent efficiency in modulus of rupture and
maximum crushing strength is the run in which moisture content of the kiln-dried material
is farthest below the corresponding air-dried material; cOllsequently, for which adjustment of
moisture had to be made across the 'widest interval.
Now it is recognized that the methods of moisture adjustment, while the best that it has
been possible to devise, are not perfect, and it can be demonstrated that any errors in the
applicability of the fundamental assumptions underlying the methods of adjustment used will
have the largest percenta.rJe effect on the compu led" efficiencies" as presen Lecl in Table 24, when:
1. Applied to those properties which are most largely affected by change of moisLure
content.
2. rrhe interval across which moi lure adjustmenL must be made is largest.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
RECOMMENDATIO .

Itis recommended thatin drying white ash for use where the retention of maximum strength
is essential, the temperatures of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A should not be exceeded.
PORT ORFORD CEDAR.

Four kiln runs have been made on Port Orford cedar.

The runs were numbered 124, 125,

126, and 157.

Kiln run 124 subjected the stock to slightly milder conditions than those specified in
Table 1, Specification 20500-A.
Run 125 was made under rather severe high-temperature conditions. From an initial
temperature of 165 0 F. and a relative humidity of 0 per cent, near the fiber-saturation point the
temperature reached 175 0 F. and the relative humidity 40 per cent, ending with a temperature of
152 0 F. and a relative humidity of 35 per cent.
The temperatures and humidities called for by Table 2 of Specification 20500-A were used
.
as a basis for the conditions of kiln run 126.
For kiln run 157, a practically constant temperature of 120 0 F. '\,ith a relative humidity of
80 per cent was used.
PHYSICAL RESULTS.

The average moisture content of green material in all four runs was 35 per cent, with samples
from 124 containing 32 per cent, 125 containing 38.2, 126 containing 35.5, and 157 containing
33 per cent. The moisture contents were reduced to 8, 4,8.2, and 8 per cent respectively. The
time varied from eight days for nm 125 to thirty-eight days for run 157, with run 124 taking
nineteen days and run 126 twenty-eight days. Runs 124 and 125 showed practically no visible
degrade, while runs 126 and 157 showed 3 and 8 per cent, respectively.
MECHANICAL RESULTS.

Comparison of kiln-dried material with previously tested air-dried material shows improvement ratios for the kiln-dried material lower in varying degrees than for air-dried material for all
properties except maximum crushing trength in compres ion pm'elle! to grain. The kiln
material approximately equals air-dried in modulus of elasticity in static bending, lagging lightly
behind air-dried material in modulus of rupture in static bending, and dropping well behind the
air-dried for work to maximum load in static bending and drop in impact bending. There are
no appreciable differences in the improvements of the first three kiln runs, all being exceptionally
uniform. Run 157, however, is somewhat erratic. It is noticeably higher than the previous
runs in improvement in work to maximum load, and noticeably lower in drop in impact bending.
CONCLUSIONS.

The previously tested air-driecl material ,\\Ti th which the kiln-dried is compared came from one
tree only, and from evidence at han,l it is concluded that it showed exceptional improvement
in air drying. It is therefore probable that the kiln-dried material gave as great improvement
as it would have done had it been subjected to a long period of ail' easoning. A comparison
of various kiln runs shows no significant diITerence in the improvcment in strength value between the different runs, in spite of a considerable range of the temperatures used in drying.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

In view of the fact that positive conclusions can not be reached until tests have been niade
on air-dried material corresponding to that kiln-dried, and the further fact that any lack of control of kiln conditions is more likely to result in damage when attempting to run by a high-temperature schedule, it is recommended that higher tcmperature and lower humidities than tho e
of Table 1, Specification 20500-A, should not be used in drying Port Orford cedar, unless there
is urgent need for rapid drying, and then only in case the kiln operation is in charge of an experienced~man.

BALD CYPRESS.

One kiln run has been made on bald cypress. In this run 2 and 3 inch material ,,'as dried,
using the temperatures and humidities of Tahle 1 of Specification 20500-A. During the last two
weeks of the run it was not possible to reduce humidity below 40 per cent, thus causing a departure to that extent from Table 1. It was necessary to steam nine different times at temperatures
ranging from 150 0 to 176 0 F. for periods of one to five hours, to relieve casehardening. (Total
time of steaming 24~ hour .)
PHYSICAL RESULTS.

The average moisture content was reduced from 91. to 7.3 per cent in 80 days, with an
average visible degrade of per <"ent due to springing and warping.
The material from butt logs "'as found to dry much more slowly than that from upper logs.
MECHANICAL RESULTS.

The kiln-dried material gave practically as great an improvement in static bending as
previously air-dried material, the former being noticeably greater in "work". The kiln-dried
material from lower bolts gave a greater improvement than that from the upper bolts in every
case except drop in impact bending. In this property, and also in maximum crushing strength
in compression parallel to grain, the air-dried material gave a greater improvement than the
kiln-dried material.
CONCLUSIONS.

It is not pos ible from results in one kiln run to form final conclusions on the proper method
of kiln drying this species. From data collected it is concluded that:
1. Upper-log material can be dried much more rapidly than that from butt logs, and the
two classes should be dried separately.
2. Cypress requires more than ordinary care in drying in order to prevent checking, honeycombing, warping, and casehal'dening.
3. Cypress can be kiln dried so as to produce material equal in its mechanical properties to
air-dried material, but final judgment on this point can not be reached until matched materia
has been air dried and tested.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

1. That butt-log material and material from upper logs be kiln dried separately.
2. That, pending the 1'e ults of furth~r tests, the tomperatures of Sper'ification 20500-A

should not be exceoded in drying bald cypross, and that humidity and steaming be regulated to
keep casehanloning at a minimum.
WESTERN HEMLOCK.

Two kiln runs have been made on 3-ineh material of this speeies. In one run the material
was dried by using temperatures and humidities approximatoly as calloel for by Tablo 1, Specification 20500-A (temperatures 1:20 0 F. initial, and 145 0 F. final; humiditio 0 per (ent initial,
and 35 pel' ('ent final). This resulted in de('l'ea ing tho moi ture contont from an average of
79 per cent to an averago of 6.7 pel' cent in a p~riod of 33 days, with a resultant visib le degrade
of 3 per cent due to opening up of cheeks.
The second, which was a high-tomperature run (tomperatures 160 0 F. initial to 180 0 F.
final, with humidities 70 per cent initial to 50 pOL' cCllt final), compares favorably with the
first run both in time requirod for drying and in amount of dograde. The time waS 19 days to
reduce the moistlll'e contont from 98.4 per cont to .2 pOI' c~nt, as comparod \\'ith 25 days to
reduco to 4.8 per cent for tho Gl"t run. The average visihle dOgI'ado was less than 1 per cent .
The first run had only light indications of ca ehardening on resawing, whilo so\'el'e casehardoning was indicated in tho second run.
MECHANICAL RESULTS.

The two runs are pra(·tically equal to each other and to proviously-tested air-dried material
in improvement of modulus of rupture and work to maximum load in static bending. However,
in modulus of elasticity, while the high temperature run equals the air-dried, the Table 1 run falls

known. facts roncerning the variability of timher and of impl'(),ement ratios as previousl~'
brought out in this report-( ase· of inferiority in improvement to previously air-dried material
might be assumed to indic'ate actual damage resulting from kiln drying. However, the fact that
the more evere kiln (onditions have prouue cd material pl'aeti( ally equal in all and (onsiderahl~­

as the hetter basis (If judgment. Groups of material tested after drying in the t,,-o kiln runs
are closely matehed to ea('h other; hene e, comparisons hetween tl{e runs are much more accurate
and positive than ('ompari 011S \\-ith the air-dried material.
CONCLUSIONS.

The conclusion that neither kiln proceRS damaged the material must he regarded as tentati,e,
peneling te ting of mat,·hed air-dried material, In t it is helieved that (onditions s('heduled in
Tahle 1 of pecification 20500 A are safe for drying "-e tel'll hemlock. Probahly (on iderably
higher temperatures could be 11 ed without damage.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

In view of the fact that positive cOIlrlllsions ran not he reaehed until test have heen made
on air-dried material cOl'responding to that kiln driec], and the f lll'therf ad that any laC'k of control
of kiln conditions is nu)('h more likely to result in damage ,,-hen attempting to run by a higher
temperature schedule, it is ref'ommendecl that Tahle ] of pe('ification 20500-A be used in
drying we tel'll hemlock.
WIDTE AND NORWAY PINE.

Material of hoth white and _Torway pine WitS driod in each of two bin run~. One run
was made with temperature varying from 1 0 0 to ~OOO F. Illlc1 relative humidity varying from
76 to 60 pel' cent. The second kiln run followed quite closely the schedule of temperatures
and relative humidi ties of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A.
PHYSICAL RESULTS.

The result of the first run wa' that the white pine was dried [rom an avemge moisture content of 99 per t:ent (0 an flyeragc of 3.3 per cent Ilnd tho ... 10n\'il~' pine from 22 ..'') to 6 per cent
in a period of ]6 dIlY". Both species hlld a yisible dogl ade of ahout 6 pel' cent, oue mo tly
to checking. The high temperature caused the pitch and rosin (0 flow to the surface and
harden.
In the second run the white pine "as dried from an .tYNago moisture conlent of 90 per

MECH \:-IICAL HESULTS.

As determined from moisluro contcnts of samplcs.

Kiln run 157.-Thi run was made in a kiln which had 1:)een erluipped with fans to produce
cireulat.ion.
The material was steamed 18 hours at 136 0 F. before tho kiln conditions givon in Tablo 25
were established. Casehardoning str(1S e which developod during the run mt1do four additional steamings necessary, at tcmpf'ro.turos of 135 0 to 160 0 F., for periods of one to two hours.
(Total time, six hours.)
Drying from an average moisture content of 100 to 8.2 pel' cent was accomplished in 57
days, with an average visible degra.de of about 8 per cent. This degrade was the result of
twisting, warping, and surface ebecking.
Ki ln T'un 15R.--Thi, run was tarted without, preiiminar.,' steaming, but it was necessary
to steam ix times (total time 19 hours) during ihe run to relie,Te ca, ehafd ening. The steaming
periods ran ged from one and one-half to six hOl!t's, at temperatures ranging from 170 0 to 182 0 F.
The m at.erial was dried from an averago moi ture content of 140 to 7.7 per ceni in 12 clays;
but. in order to relieve casoharJening it was necessary to continue the run for 9 da.'Ts, during
which the moisture co ntent of tho samples was reducod to 5.1 pl'r cont. The nloi ture contellt
of the green materinl ranged from 69 to 20 per cent.
The material wa in good condition on entering ibe killl, although se,'eral pieces bowed
end aIid heart check, shake, and 'pringing. Aflrcr being dried the material came out wiih an
average degrade from warpll1g. springing, twi ting, and urface cbecking of approximately 6
per cent.
DISCUS ION AND CONCLU JON .

The material was compared wiih val'iou air-dried fir (::;iIYe1', grand, and noble) a well a
white fir. In every case, except maximum drop in impact bending, kiln run 157 is superior to
the average of the air-dried firs. Kiln run 158 is somewhat lower than this a'~erage in maximum
drop in impact bending and in maximum crushing sirength in compression parallel to grain.
Both runs produc d material which was betier in imprOyelllent of trengib properties than
material from the one ayailable tree of air-dried white fir, excepi in comprcs'ion parallel to the
grain. In this properLy the high-temperature run (15 ) wa inferior to the air-drieo material.
It appears that no iO'nificant damage occurred to the trcngth properties from either kiln
treatment, and it is probable that the Table 1 run (157) produced at lea t as good re ults as
would bave resulted from air drying.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
RECOMMENDA TtONS.

1. Pending the completion of te, t on air-dried material matching that kiln dried, it is
recommended that Table 1 of pecifiC'ation 20500 .\. be u. cd in drying "hite fir for u e where
maximum trength is essential.
2. If faster drying than can be produced hy following t he above recommendation is nece ary, the telllperatur s as u cd in run 15 appenr to be fairly safe , providing the humidit,y i
regulated to prevent ' eYCl'e casehanlen ing.
3. Beeau 'e of the large variation in moisture con·te nt of different, boards of thi species, it
i recommended that this material be divided into two or more group. according to the wei ght
of the piece, which is an indication of the moi,ture coni<'nt, and that either t.he group. be
kiln dried separately Or the hea vier material be pla('ed in the most rapid drying part of the kiln.

EFFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIHPLANE WOODS.

533

The material for all runs was approximately 1 inch in thickness.
The material for all runs except 108 was steamed before drying was commenced, and all
t'uns except 106 were again steamed from one to four times to relieve casehardening. The
steaming for run 162, however, was to relieve only very slight casehardening.
MECHANICAL RESULTS.

African mahogany.-A decided gain in improvement was made by all kiln runs over the
previously tested air-dried material in modulus of rupture and maximum drop. Work to maximum load, modulus of elasticity, and maximum crushing strength may all be considered equal
to the average of the air-dried in improvement.
No apparent damage is shown in any kiln run, and the material is considered to have made
at least as good improvement as would have resulted from air drying.
Oentral American mahogany.- Material from all the kiln runs shows very good improvement in strength properties over the corresponding green material. Improvement ratios are
in nearly every case as high as resulted from the air drying of material previously tested.
There appears to be but very little difference in the improvement for the various strength
properties produced by the different processes of drying.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS.

The satisfactory results from these kiln runs indicate that the temperatures of both Tables
1 and 2, Specification 20500- A, are safe, as four of the runs were made with temperatures
approximately those called for by Table 1 or 2, and one run subjected the stock to severer
temperatures.
The consi tent though slight inferiority of the high-temperature run (107) to run 106,
which was made on material from the same trees, indicates a possible relation between strength
and temperature used in drying.
Run 162, the material in which was Central American mahogany, was made with temperatures closely approximating those of Table 1, but the relative humidities were not permitted
to drop below 60 per cent. This run produced material "which was in excellent condition for
propeller stock and which was slightly better in improvement of strength properties than
materialfrom the same shipment dried in run 161. While no run was ma.de on African mahogany
using conditions similar to run 162, it is believed, since the two woods a.re seemingly closely
related in physical properties, that such a run would produce practically the same results.
Special tests taken on this run showed even cross-sectional drying and very slight casehal'dening. These results indicate that the condition under which the material in run 162 was dried
is very satisfactory for drying propeller stock.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

It is recommended that in drying Central American and African mahoganies, the temperatures of Table 1 of Specification 20500- A be used, but that the relative humidity be not allowed
to drop below 60 per cent at any time during the run.
BLACK WALNUT.

In order to develop a process of kiln drying black walnut satisfactorily, two kiln runs were
made, one in accordance 'with Table 1 and the other in accordance 'with Table 2 of Specification 20500-A.
The Table 1 run consisted of I-inch and the Table 2 of both 1 and 2 inch stock.
The Table 2 run was controlled by both 1 and 2 inch samples, which delayed the drying
process slightly as the 2-inch material dried very slowly. The 2-inch samples were discarded
from calculations during the last stages of the run and conditions better adapted to I-inch
stock were secured. The material was steamed at 120 0 F. for six hours at the beginning and for
one hour at 150 0 F. at the end of the run, the latter to relieve casehardening.

534

A NUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The I-inch material dried from an average of 72 to an average of 8 per cent in a period of
38 days, but 2-inch material in tho same period reduced only to 18 per cent from 54 per cent.
The material entered the kiln "ith end and heart checks, heart rot, and springing, and came out
with au average degrade of about 7 per cent caused by springing, checking, and warping.
The condition of Lhe second run during the final stages was slightly milder than required
by Table 1 of pecification 20500-A. The material "as frozen when loaded into the kiln and
it was nece 'sary to thaw it out, by steaming, before drying could begin. Toward the end of
the run it wa nece ary to steam the material one hour at 150 0 F. to relieve ca ehardening.
At the beginning of the'run the stock contained an a,erage moi ture content of 78.6 per
cent, which was reduced to 7.7 per cent in 31 days. It left the kiln in good condition, showing
a ,isible degrade of about 21 per cent caused by end checking.
CO CLUSIO S.

The improvement rn,tios show Lhat, with exception of drop in impact bending, both kiln
runs produced greater improvement in sLrength properties than resulted in the ca e of the
pre,~iously air-dried material, and in ull probability as good results as would have been obtained
by air drying the ame material. .~s both run follow closely Table 1 and 2 of the specification,
it follow that either of these tables can be expected to giYe satisfactory re ults when u ed for
drying I-inch black walnut. The strength data give no basis for a choice between the two kiln
runs.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

'rhe work so far done gives, of course, no ba is for judging the effect of conditions more
seyere than '1'able l. Until the effect of more severe condition can be ascertained, it i recommended that Table 1 of Specification 20500-A b used for drying black walnut.
SUGAR MAPLE.

Seven experim ntal kiln runs in tbe drying or sugar maple have been made, but only the fir t
Lhree, 132, 13:3, q,ncl J 34, ha ,-e reached a stage where discussion and analy is are po ible and
iigmes arc available.
The first run 0:32) was on I-inch maLerial only; the la t two runs (133 and 134) "ere on both
I-inch and 2-ineh material. Run 132 was made to determii.1e the efrect of a practically con tant
temperature of 170 0 F. and the same relatiye humidiLie as called for by Table 2 of pecification
20500-.~; run 13:3 wa in accordance with Table 1, and run 134 was in accordance with Table 2
of this speeificaLion. Runs 133 and 13'1 were both steamed ncar the end of the run to relieve
ca ehardening. No steaming was necessary on run 132.
The high-temperature run (132) was made in the least time, requiring 12 days, but had the
smallest dilTerellce bet,\'een initial and final moisture contents, the initial moisture content
being 4 and th~ final per cent. This run had the large t average degrade-about 15 per cent.
The degrade was clue chiefly to ,rarping, with ome springing and Lwi Ling. Slight casehardening
was evident on re awing.
The Table 1 run (133) required 23 days, practically twice the time of the previous run, but
reduced the average moisture content from 56 to 5. per cent, with an average degrade of 11
pereenL due to cupping, warping, and springing, the greater portion being due to cupping. Very
little casehardening developed on resu,,,-ing.
Kiln run 134 required 29 clays to reduce the average moisture content from 56 to. 7.5 per
cent, buL had the smallest degrade of any run-about per cent, due to cupping and warping.
The material showed very slight rever e casehardening on being re awed.
RESULTS.

There is no marked or consi tent difference in the mechanical results of the three runs.
The kiln-dried material showed improvement over matched green material equal or superior to
that pre'Viou ly obtained by ai.r drying.

";FFECT OF KILN DRYING ON STRENGTH OF AIRPLANE WOODS.

535

CONCLUSIO S.

Absolutely definite conclu ions can not be reached until tests on corre ponding air-dried
material have been made; but the data warrant the conclusions:
]. That kiln drying can be carried on without inj Ul'y of material, and probably with better
results than can be obtained by air drying.
2. That there are no con i tent difference in the effects of the three run. This indicates
that a considerable rat1O'e of temperature can be employed with little, if any, difference in the
effect on the mechanical properties.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

Until the above conclu ion ()To. 2) has been checked by tests on corre ponding air-dried
material, and because of the greater danger of damage through accidental departure from
schedules when operating at higher temperatures, it is recommended that maple be dried by
schedule of Table 1 of Specifieation 20500- A.
YELLOW BIRCH.

Fi\Te kiln nms have been made on yello,," birch, as follows:
Run 8·1 was on 21-inch plank, with temperntures "!. '30° F. initial to 1, 0° F. final, initial and
final humiditie of about 77 and 13 per cent, l'especLively. The a,oerage moi. ture content wa
reduced from 60 to .J per cent in about 31 days. There was e\"iclence of ca~ehardening in some
parts of the pile at the end of the run.
Run 16, wa on l-inch tock. Temperatures "oere approximately those of Ta,ble 1. Initial
and final humiclitie. were about 0 ancl :~5 pel' cent, respectively. TI,e material was steamed
six times, at temperatures varying from 150° to 16.5° F. and periods of one-fourth to one hour,
for the relief of casehardening, which pcrsi. tently de,oeloped. There was slight casehal'dening
at the end of the run. Uneven sllwing, which prevented propel' piling and weighting of the stock,
was chiefly responsible.for the degrade of ahout 10 per cent. Moisture content was reduced
from 6-4- to 7.6 per cent in 16 days.
Run 169 was on I-inch stock. Kiln conditions were approximately th~ose of Table 1,
Specification 20500-A. Steaming three times, itt 160°, 170°, and 160° F. for three hour, two
hours, and two hours, respecti\"ely, near the end of the rUll, left purt of the stock severely C[lsehardened and part in a condition of se,"erdy reyer cd casehardening. Degra(le was about the
same as in run 16. and due to the same causes. Moisture content was reduced from 58 to
per cent in 17 days .
Run 170 was on I-inch stock, "oith kiln conditions approximately as pre cribed by Table 2
of Specification 20500-A. Five steaming were made at about 20° F. above the .3cheduled dry·
ing temperatures. The stock W,tS praciically fre(' from casehardening at the close of the run.
Degrade of a.bout 7 ..'5 per cent resulted from tbe same causes as in run 16. Moi ture content
was reduced from about 65 to R.2 per cent in 31 days.
Run 203 was made on I-inch parti<llly air-dried stock. Kiln conditions were approximately
those of Table 1.
teaming for one hour at 160° F . on the eighth day and for two hours at 170°
F. on the tenth day successfully relio,ed the casehardening which had developed. The moisture
content was reduced from 18.5 to about 7 pel' cent in 10 days. There wa about 5 per cent
degrade.
MECHANICAL RESULTS.

Comparisons by means of improvement ratio indicate that runs 16 ., 169, and 170 produced practically equal improvement, and that this improvement is equal to the average of
two trees previously air dried, being Ie s than OliO and greater tha.n the othor. Improvement
in run -l: is Ie than the minimum for the preyiously air-dried material. Comparisons of run
203 with the others are difficult to make because of the partially air-clried eondition of the stock
before it was placed in the kiln.

536

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.
CONCLUSION.

The kiln conditions of Tables 1 and 2 produced results in the drying of yellow birch which
are equal to those to be expected from air drying.
It seems probable that the one run at temperatures of 130 0 to !EW O F. has failed to produce
as good results as would have been obtained from air drying.
RECO 1MENDATIONS.

Both Table 1 and Table 2 of Specification 20500-A are recommended as suitable for the
drying of yellow birch.
OAK.

Seven kiln runs were made on oaks, including red and white oak species from the South and
white oak (presumably true white (Q'UP1'Cll~ albu» from northern Indiana. The testing work,
inclusive of tests on air-dried material, has been entirely completed. The data, however, are
very erratic and it is difficult to arrive at consi tent conclusions.
One run (A), at temperatures varying from 150 0 to 165 0 F. (mel relative humidities from
( 5 to 60 per cent, produced very good result from the strength standpoint on southern red
and white oak species, with the exception of Spanish oak. The charge was steamed for one
hour and t,,·o hours at temperature' of 179 0 and 1'10 0 F., respectively, to relieve casehardening
stre se. However, this run resulted in a degrade of 60 per cent a determined from in pection
before and after kiln drying. The causes of degrade included severe cusehardening, warping,
cupping, honeycombing, n.nd collapse.
Two runs (B ancl C) on northern white oak gave entirely satisfactory results from the
strength standpoint. Run B was with temperatures approximately a' prescribed in Table 2
of ,-pecification 20500-.\. and relative humidities ranging between 90 ancI 70 per cent. This run
was steamed at 135 0 F. for one hour to relieve casehardening stres es. Run C was at temperatures
of 120 0 F. initial a,11(1140 0 F. final, with relative humidities about 90 initial and 50 unal. It was
necessary to steam thi material three time ', at temperatmes from 160 0 to 16-1: 0 F., for a total of
two and one-half hour', to relieve caseharclening tresses at the end of the run. Both gave
results fully equal to air ury, with the 10\\'01' temperature run (B) slightly the better. Material
in both ca e came from the kiln in excellent condition, there being les than 1 per cent clegrade
in run B ~1.nd less than 11 per cent in run C.
In anothel'l"un(D), with temperatures 90 0 F. initial to about 125 0 F. final and humidities ranging from saturation down to 40 per cent, northern white oak came from tbe kiln with about 1
per cent degrade, resulting from springing and warping. At the close of the run the charge
was steamed seven hours at 155°F. to relieve the casehurdening stresses. Strength tests indicated
that till material was slightly deficient in strength properties as compared to matched airdried material.
Still another run (E), \vith initial temperature of about 100 0 F. to final 130 0 F. and humidities
ranging from saturation to about 45 per cent, resulted in about 71 per cent degrade. The material was steamed twice at 1 50 and 170 0 F. to kill mold and mildew. A final steaming at 1 00 F.
was to relieve casehardening stresses. This run, however, included southern red oak and both
northern and southern white oaks, and while the different species were not separately graded,
it was observed that the degrade was more erious in the red than in the white oak. Thenorthern
white oak from this rUll was also slightly deficient in strength properties as compared to matched
air-dried stock.
Southern white oak was included in runs A and E, as above described. Run A produced
quite satisfactory re ults from the strength standpoint, while run E resulted in a considerable
loes of strength as compared to air-dried materinl.
Two additional runs, F and G, included southern white oak. Run F was made with temperatures of 105 0 F. initial and about 135 0 F. final and relative humidities 85 initial to about 40
per cent final- approximately the condition of Table2. Run G was with temperatures of 120 0 F.
initial to about l40 0 F. final and with humidities as in F. These runs included also southern red

oak specie. Run F was steamed three times for periods of one hour each, at 155 0 F., to relieve
casehardening tresses. The d egracle in run F ,,-as ] 2 pel' cen t, from warping, springing, and
cupping; while G resulted in 50 pel' cC'n t degrade from , pringing, warping, cupping, checking,
twisting, collapse, honeycombing, Hnd casehul'clening. Run G was steamed on three occasions
fol' periods of one-half hour, at tempemtures of 150 0 to 170 0 F., to relieve cnsehal'dening stres es.
Run F gave quiLe sntisfactory results from Lhe strengt.h slnndpoint, while in G the results were
. unsatisfactory, there being a loss of 25 Lo 30 pel' cent in modulus of rupture, \\'ork to maximum
load, and heigh I, of drop in impact. Exclusive of Spani h oale, the results from the str ength
tandpoint were as follows:
outhern red otl/es, including Spanish oak, were dried in runs A, E, F, and G. Run F produced approximately as good material as air dry, run G maLerial con iderably inferior to au' dry,
and run E, as indicated by maximum drop in impact and maximum crushing strength in compression parallel (there being no static bending tests), material very much inferior to matched
air-dried stock .
None of these runs (A, E, F, and G) gave satisfacLory results from the trength stan dpoint on pani h oak. Runs F and G resulted in 10 ses in all strengtb properties, 'with F possibly
slightly superior to G. Run A gave results somewhat superior to either F or G, while the results
in E were inferior to either F ' 01' G.
From the results as presented above it is concluded: (1) That under the same kiln conditions'
northern white oak can be expected to dry with smaller losses, both from the strength standpoint
and the standpoint of degrade in appearance, than southern oaks, either red or white; (2)
that of the sou them oaks the red oak pecies require more care than the white oak species ; (3)
that Spanish oak is con iderably more liable to damage of strength properities in kiln drying
than the other red oak species from the southern region; (4) that, in general, the northern oaks
are more easily kiln dried than the southern.
I t is evident from experience in these runs, and the conclusion is borne out by experience
in drying oak on a commercial scale, that the maintenance of suitable kiln conditions requu'es
more care in the case of oaks than in other species or groups of species. Oak has been found in
all experimentation with it, as well as in it utilization, to he more variable than other species. To
attempt to specify beforehand exactly what kiln condition should be used seems unwise. The
results of these kiln-drying and strength tests indicate that the temperatures of Table 1 of Specification 20500-A are probably the maximum which arc safe for northern white oak, and lik ewise
that the temperatures of Table 2 should not be exceeded Ul drying southern oak, either red or
white. In drying any of the oaks very careful attention must be giv en to the condition of the
stock in all parts of the kiln. Temperatures and humidities must be regulated not only by the
moisture content of the stock but also by its condition with re pect to checking, casehardening,
the existence of a difference in moisture content between the outside and the inside of the piece,
and the existence of stressed conditions.

INTRODUCTION.

In airplane performance estimates the fuel load is given usually in terms of a quantity
sufficient for a certain number of hours of motor consumption at full throttle. In a weightcarrying machine more useful load can, of course, be carl'ied as the fuel load required to attain
the objective is diminished.
.
It becomes, therefore, of practical interest to examine the relations between these loads
in greater detail than usual.
A machine can fly high or low, at maximum speed or at most economical speed, or at
most economical power consumption. It is not at all evident a priori which of these or what
combination of them is best under given conditions. The following study was primarily made
to determine the conditions necessary to attain a given objective WIth the maximum bombing
load and return.
It is, of course, evident that the calculations and theory as applied to bombing purposes
will apply equally well for commercial load carrying purposes. The results are also directly
applicable to the interesting questions of long distance flights, across the oceans or for purposes of exploration.
The investigation was made by two independent methods, one involving the usual performance estimate methods, the other based upon theoretical considerations.
As a specific example the data on an 800-horsepower, 15,OOO-pound bombing machine was
used, but the method is applicable with slight variations to any machine.

CONDITIONS FOR MAXIMUM RANGE.

It is evident that the work required to fly a given distance, being the product of the total
resistance, or ra luired propeller thrust, by the distance, is least when the thrust is kept at its
mini'llum ,alues. The points of minimum drug were, therefore, located on the resistance curves.
These points determined the mosL economical speeds and the corresponding relUlred powers.
The powers thus determined are seen not to be minimum powers. The minimum powers are
but slightly less than those corresponding to minimum resistance and occur at speeds slightly
less than minimum resistance speeds. The minimum power is that for which the .fuel consnmrtion is least for a given time and as it turns out, is not the most economical power for
flying the greatest distance. The speed corresponding to minimum power is the speed at which
't machine should fly in order to remain aloft the greatest po~sihle time.

A STUDY OF AIRPLANE RANGES AND USEFUL LOADS.

FUEL CONSUMPTION.

The fuel consumption at ma.ximum brake horsepower output is taken as O.G pound per
horsepower hour, and for any reasol1.<'tblo tlu'ottled condition this number is increased to 0.7.
The available horsepower curve was obtained in the usual manner by assuming proper
propeller efficiencies at slow and high speeds and mulbplying these into the available brake
horsepower. The fuel consumption per horsepower delivered by the propeller can therefore
be computed by dividing the fuel consumption per brake horsepower of the motor by the
propeller efficiency at that speed, or what is the same thing, multiplying 0.6 by 800 and
dividing by the available horsepo"Wer at that speed. As mentioned above, these results are
multiplied by

~:~ in order to compensate for a slight loss of efficiency under throttled con-

ditions. This nrocedure corresponds to experimental tests and if anything probably overestimates the fuel consumption.
With these data Table 2 and figure 3 were made. The fuel consumption is seen to be
proportional to the weight.

The maximum possible range is seen to be 2,4 0 miles under the e conditions.
DETERMINATION OF THE MAXIMUM LOAD FOR A GIVEN OBJECTIVE.

Evidently in ca e a return trip i to be made without refueling the greatest distance for
an objcctive is equal to or less than half thi greatest range. It is easy to determine the greatest
po sible u efulload by means of the weight-di tance curve, figure 5, in the following way :

Fig. 5.

Suppose the objective is 600 miles distant. It requires AB-CD pounds of fuel to get
there and GF pounds to get back after the load i deposited. Since the maximum load is AB
pounds there will be left DE or D 'E' pounds for useful load. Calling the maximum range S,
project the points on the curve for 8=600, point D , and 8=S-600, point F, on the weight
axis, the weight included between these two points is the maximum load for that objective.
This procedure is quite general. The load decreases to zero as the objective distance increases
to half the maximum range and increases to the maximum load a the objective distance
decreases to zero.

CONSEQUENCES OF FLYING AT MAXIMUM SPEED.

In Table 2a the results for flight at maximum speed are tabulated. The gas consumption
is constant and the speed of advance was found to be constant to within about 1 per cent. The
average value, 106.2 miles per hom was, therefore, used in the computations.
The weight-distance cmve (fig. 4) is a straight line, as the fuel consumption and speed are
very approximately constant.
The maximum range is considerably less than under greatest range conditions. The difference is 740 miles. A considerable gain in range is thus attained by flying at the proper
angle and hence at proper speed.
The useful loads for maximum speed are considerably less than under best range conditions. For an objective 600 miles away the best conditions give a possible load of 4,050 pounds
while at maximum speed this is reduced to 2,430 pounds, a reduction of 1,620 pounds.
For convenience, a comparison of the loads and ranges corresponding to them is made
in the following tables:

For the shorter flights the differences decrease but they are considerable in all cases. The
bombing load is increased by almost 190 per cent for maximum range speeds over maximum
speed conditions for 10 hours fuel.
FLYING AT MINIMUM POWER.
\

The gas consumption at minimum power is practically identical with that at best range
power. While the minimum power is slightly less than the power for best range speed, the
speed is also less and the propeller efficiency is also slightly less. The net result is that the time
of flight is about the same and the maximum range is diminished.
A calculation of the range at minimum power gives 2,400 miles instead of 2,480 miles.
For flight at minimum power the angle of attack is practically constant and slightly greater
than that for best range speed.
TIME REQUIRED FOR ANY RANGE.

For convenience, the curves of elapsed time for any distance flown are given in figure 4
for both best range peeds and maximum speed conditions. By means of them the time of
going and returning from any given objective may be read of!'. In particular it is seen that
the maximum time of flight under high speed is 16.4 hours as against 38.0 hours for best range
speed.
For a bombing raid on an objective at 600 miles, the total elapsed time to go and return
is for maximum speed 11.25 hours and for best range speed 18.65 hours. It will be seen in the
following how this time difference may be decreased by flying at high altitudes without changing the efficiency for best range conditions.

From equations (1) and (2) we get by division
(3)

This equation shows, since 'Y has disappeared, that for a constant angle of attack and given
weight the thrust is independent of the height at which the flight takes place, and also that for
a constant angle of attack the thrust is proportional to the total weight.
It is for the first reason that no mention of altitude was made in Part 1. The second
statement is verified in figure 2, which plainly shows very approximate proportionality at all
actual flying speeds.
It is convenient to employ the polar diagram in the following: This kind of diagram
deserves greater popularity than it has yet received in aeronautical calculations in the United
tates. It consists in plotting L as ordinates against D as abscissae. Any point M on the
curve corresponds to a given Land D and hence to a given angle of attack. This angle of
attack is marked on the curve.

That is to say, for minimum thrust the tangent to the polar curve must have a value D ~R
Looking at the polar diagram it is seen that the line QM t tangent at MI fulfills this condition
and correspontls to a given angle of attack i l . Since the polar is a given curve for the machine, it
follows that
(a) for minimum thrust the machine must fly at a constant angle of incidence throughout the whole flight whatever the loading may be, and
(b) that these minimum thrusts are independent of altitude of flight.
In Part I , Table 2b, the angles of incidence corresponding to the least drag have been
tabulated. They are remarkably constant, their average deviation from the mean 5.33 0 being
only 0.12 0 and the greatest difference 0.3 0.
For best range speeds, then, it follows that

In particular for

maximum range conditions they have the values corresponding to the maximum value of D ~ R

Let us suppose that the machine loses weight gradually due to fuel consumption alone.
If the weight-distance curve can be deduced, the problem of bombing loads and ranges is
solved, as explained in Part 1.

This maximum time of flight computed with equation (13), using 1.03 pounds per hor epower hour as the average fuel consumption, gives a value of tmnx = 3 .3 hours, as compared

The curve then is a traight line to a high approximation and can always be taken as uch.
EFFECT OF CLIMB AT START AND GLIDE AT END OF FLIGHT .

If the flight is 0 made that the plane i allowed to climb teadily a the load decrea e ,
it must, of COUT e, come down at the end of the :flight when all the fuol is exhau ted. The
potential energy put into the plane by the consumption of a certain amount of fu el i then
partially reemployed in the de cent. A light calculation how that it i puerile to consider
this effect, a shown below.
Assume that the plane rise undor pOWOl' to a height h with full fuel load and at the end
of the flight de cends with power shut oft' and without fuel. The potential energy which can not
be regained is hence approximately the work done in rai ing tho total weight of fuel to the
maximum h eight reached. As shown previously, the expenditUTe of fuel i about 1 pound per
horsepower-hoUT delivered by the propeller, which i equivalent to
550 X 60 X 60 = 1,9 0,000 foot-pound of energy per pound of fuel.

Assume 50 pel' cent u efulload (all fuel), thE' work required to rai e tIl(' plane to a height
h is

W

2" x h foot-pounds ,
which is a considerably overe timated value, a the climb i gradual, and the total fuel load is
not raised to the maximum heiO'ht.

(gas and oil), a uming 6 pound to the gallon. \ s the total load is 1,250 gallons, thi amount
i about one-half of 1 per cent of the total fu el load, which i quite negligible in calcula tion of
this nature.
As th percentage amoun.t fol' fLny other type of machin e would be about the same, we
have made no effort to take tIlis theoretically intero ting part of ,the ubj ect into consideration .
PRACTICAL SIMPLIFIED METHOD OF APPLYING THIS THEORY TO A SPECIFIC CASE.

The application of this theory to any specific case now reduces to the greatest simplicity
as follows:
D ata required. Wr=weight ful1y loaded with fuel
We = weight empty of fuel.
i1 = angle of incidence for minimum total resistance.
1. Calculate the maximum range for an all fuel load by equation 17

and plot the value of S/2 as abscissa for an ordinate B = o.
2. Plot W r - We as an ordinate for S=o.
3. Connect these two points by a straight line and we have a diagram similar to the following figure:

Objective

Fig. 8.

Any ordinate such as CD will give the maximum pound of load that can be carried for
an objective at distance OC. The dis tance DE will give the corresponding weight of gasoline
to be carried. (See Fig. 6. )

AL REPORT NATIONAL ADVI ORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTIC

EFFECT OF ALTITUDE ON SPEED, POWER, AND TIME.

From equation (5) it follows that for a given weight the speed must increase as'Y diminishes
and the exact relation is
(23)

where h is the height characterized by 'Y. From equat.ion (7) it follows that the po,,"er required
for flight increases in the same proporation as the speed so that
_Po
P h'Y

(24)

This is otherwise evident as the thrust does not change.
From the latest experimental tests of motor horsepower and. motor efficiency at altitudes,
it is found that the power falls off almost in proportion to the density so that
(25)

Hence, to fly at an altitude characterized by 'Y, a power Po' at the ground, which becomes Po''Y at
the height, corresponding to 'Y, must be provided, such that
Po
P o' 'Y= .J-y

(26)

If the maximum available horsepower Po max. at the ground is provided, the plane will ri e
until

Pomax.'Y=

(27)

or to such an altitude as is characterized by

Po
'Y= ( - - )2/3
Pomax.

(2 )

In order to provide a constant thrust the propeller must increase in angular speed according
to the same law as the plane since propeller blades are aerodynamically similar to wings, so that
(29)

It follows immediately from this that since V and n increase III the same ratio then \"
.71D
remains constant with altitude, and hence the propeller efficiency.
There arc thus several reasons why flight at a high level will be better than at low.
(a) The motor running full open will probably use less fuel per horsepower than has been
assumed for till'ottle, say, in the ratio of 0.6 to 0.7.
(b) The motor running at a higher speed can develop slightly more power with proper
adjustment, which will increase the height, and therefore the peed.
(c) A very good third reason is that th duration of the flight will be considerably lessened
and this, together with
(d) the increased safety due to high altitude and greater flying speed lead to the conclusion
that: For bombing purposes the aviator shoull fly at a certain predetermined constant anale
of attack; he should allow the plane to rise as the load diminishes.
ince the work consumed in rising to the higher level is at least partially returned when
the machine glid s down at the end of the trip without power, these works have not been considered.
.
The aviator will thus attain the greatest range, carry the great st load, secure the greatest
safety and speed consistent with these conditions and ecomomize in time as well.

that in calm ail' the machine must fly at minimum thrust, a is otherwise evident.
Thus the minimum points of the T- V curve lie directly over the point of tangency of
lines from the origin to the P-V eliI've .
If thore is a head wind this condition of minimum thrust 110 longer holds and more power
is required for most economic flight which corre ponds, of course, to a greater thru t.
A the power curve is limited to the right by the maximum output of the power plant it

OH, whore II is the intersection of the tangent to the P-V curve at its limi t with the V-axis.
It i', of coul' e, possible to make headway again t stronger winds, but the condition for economical flight in such a ca e is no longer fulfilled. When w i a helping wind the tangent is
drawn from a point on the left of 0 and it is evident that as the following wind increase in speed
it pay to use Ie sand les power, the limit for an infinite wind being minimum power. In other
words, it pay to let the wind carry the machine along with the least u e of the power plant.
Curiou ly enough, thi corresponds' to a thru t greater than the minimum which is proper in
calm air .
While for economic flight in calm air the machine must fly at minimum thrust and hence
at maximum LID 1 for the machine for all loads, this simplicity doe not obtain for economic flight in the wind. Not only doe the LID change for a given load wiLh varying winds,
but also for a constant wind it varie with the load. Fortunately these variations are mall
for any reasonable head winds and for a change of load equal to the weight of the machine
empty. Referring to figure 9, the prqper L/D '~lor the machine and hence the proper angles
of incidence may be determined by the method demonstrated above .
A uming a head wind of w miles per hour draw tang nts to the re~uired hoI' epower
curves from abscissa + w. Read oIT on the thrust curve the tbru t corresponding to the points
of tangency on tho power curves, divide these thrusts by the corre ponding weight of the machine
and the values thus obtained are the DIUs Qorresponding to economical flight under the
a sumed conditions.

EXAMPLE OF USE OF THE ONE-CURVE METHOD.

In order to check the proposed method against the usual multicurve method, three P-V
curves were plotted for the arne machine with loads of 7,000 pound, 10,000 pounds, and 13,000
pounds, respectively. The machine weighs 7,000 pounds empty.
These curve are hown in Fig . (10). The L ID' for various wind speeds were derived from
them and compared with the LID's taken from the 10,000-pound curve using modified wind
speeds as described above.

Several interesting results appear from the values obtained.
1. The influence of wind on the L ID i greater for light load than for heavy. A change
in L ID from .43 to 5.90 is found for the 7,000-pound machine a again t a change from 8.43 to
7.60 for the l3,OOO-pound machine, these values corresponding to a change in head-wind peed
of 50 miles per hour.
2. Thi influence ,till holds although much less noticeably for helping wind, the L ID
changing from .43 to .30 for the light machine a against .43 to .34 for the heavy machine .
3. For any rea onable head wind that could be flown again t in long-distance flight, the
change in the L ID i mall, running from .43 to .00 for the 7,OOO-pound ca e to .43 to .25
for the l3,000-pound ca e, the e value corre ponding to a head wind of 0 and 30 miles !per hour
respectively.

A STUDY OF AIRPLANE RANGES AND USEFUL LOADS.

As practically it is difficul t to fly at a given angle with mathematical accuracy the maw
result of these figures is to show that as the head winds increase in speed it is necessary to slightly
diminish the flying angle; exactly how much depending on a preliminary calculation as ou tlined above.
The instructions to the pilot can be given in either of two ways:
(a) P roper flying angles for any given wind.
(b) Proper air speed for any given wind.

The time-distance equation must be modified. Since the ground distance is the important
factor the wind modifies the range. If at any instant the air-speed is V and the wind speed w,
the ground speed is V - w, and in time dt a ground distance
dS= (V -w)dt

SUMMARY .

The relation between useful load and range has been worke.d out by two distinct m ethods.
Part I employs no n ew theory and is made by the usual p erformance estimate methods . It
would involve considerable plotting of CUl'ves and is cumbersome.
Part II gives a theoreticl1.l solution. This solution checks remarkably well with the previous one in every particular. It leads to an elegant and simple solution for any specific case.
Direction are given for the application of the results of this paper to any machine. The
total time r equired for this complete calculation should not take over 15 minutes.
The results of interest for calm air are:
L The machine should fly at a constant angle of attack, the angle corresponding to the

2. It is practically imml1.terial whether the machine flies high 01" low as far as range IS
concerned.
3. There is an advantage in flying high in that the time is much reduced.
4. The resistance is proportional to the weight at a given altitude.
5. The result of flying at maximum speed is a very much diminished range, or for a given
range a very much diminished u seful load.
6. The result of flying at minimum power is to slightly reduce the range.
7. The ,times of flight at the same level f01" flying at best range speed and at minimum
power speed are practicl1.11y the same.
8. The condition for best range is shown.
9. The weight-time curve is deduced.
10. The range-time curve is deduced.
1]. The weight-range curve is deduced.
12. The effect of altitude has been taken into account.
13. The time is greatly diminished for flying at corresponding le,els.
14. The theory checks closely with the ordinary methods of Part I.
P art III gives a theoretical solution of the effect of wind on range. First, a proof of a
method for determining the LID and air speed for the machine under any wind conditions is
given. A new m ethod is shown wherein but one P -V curve is required for any load and any
wind speed.
Variations in L ID for changes in load and wind speed are derived and checked against
the usual m ethods.
The weight-distance formula is derived as modified by winds.
The results of interest for flight in winds are:
1. The angle of attack changes but slightly when flying against winds of reasonable
trength, and but very slightly when flying with winds of any strength.
2. The altitude of flight affects the range. The reason being that higher speed are attained
at higher altitudes and the ratio of air speed to wind speed changes. However, as wind
speeds change with altitude it does not seem worth while to go into the matter more fully.
3. Other things being etlual , it is lightly advantageous to 11y high, especially as to time
"f flight.
4. The weight-time curve is unchanged .
.5 . The range-time curve is deduced.
6. l'he weight-range curve is deduced .

PRELIMINARY REPORT ON FREE FLIGHT TESTS.
By EDWARD P. WARNER and F. II. NORTON.

DESCRIPTION OF AIRPLANE EMPLOYED.

I n a series of tests which have been made by the advisory committee's staff at Langley
Field during the summer of 1919 with the objects of determining the characteristics of airplanes
in flight and the extent to which the actual characteristics differ from those predicted from
tests on models in the wind tunnel, and of studying the balance of the machines and the forces
which must be applied to the controls in order to maintain longitudinal equilibrium; two airplanes have been employed. Both are advanced training machines of the J 4H type and
both are equipped with Hispano-Suiza 150 horsepower engines, but they are somewhat different in structural details. The most important differences in connection with the aerodynamic
characteristics of the airplanes are the use of an oil radiator su pended below the body and a.
reserve gasoline tank mounted in the center section of the upper wing on one of the machines,
these accessories being lacking on the other. The machine carrying the oil radiator and the
reserve tank will be referred to in this report as o. 1, the other as No.2. In addition to the
differences just noted, airplane No. 1 had the aluminum doors in the sides of the body: just
forward of the wings, removed in order to permit of a freer flow of air through the radiator
and past the engine, while No. 2 was flown with these doors in place. No cowling over the
upper part of the engine was used on either machine, this being freely exposed to the air in
order to dissipate as much heat as possible directly to the slip stream as it passed over the cylinder heads. D espite all precautionary measures adopted to prevent overheating, great difficulty was experienced in keeping the engine cool during the summer, and it was seldom possible
to climb with the throttle fully open for more than a few minutes without raising the water
temperature dangerously ncar the boiling point.
The two machines used are shown in figure 1, and general arrangement drawings of the
JN4H are given in figure 2. The more important areas and the weights are tabulated below:

The difference in weight is due to the larger amount of gasoline and oil carried by No.1
and to the extra tank and oil radiator provided on that machine.
The propellers used on the two machines were nominally exactly alike, both being made
from the Air Service's design No. 13,279, having a diameter of 8 feet 6 inches, and being designed for an effective pitch of 5.22 feet. Actually they were quite different, the propeller
which was used on machine No. 2 in most of the work having warped so that tho pitch was

considerably less than it was supposed to be. The other propeller checked extremely well with
the dra,vings, the mean blade angles for the two blade being correct within 0°.1 at all radii
except within three inches of the tip, where the angle of setting was too large by 0°.35. The
effect which this difference between the two propellers had on the results of the tests ,dll
be discu sed el ewhere.
The most important factor from an aerodynamic standpoint is, of course, the type, form
and arrangement of the main supporting surfaces. The \ving section was accordingly checked
up by direct measurement at several points on each machine, a frame being used which encircled
the wing and provided base lines for measuring the cambers on both the upper and the lower

curve by having a smaller camber on both surfaces. Tho maximum discrepancy between the
Eiflel 36 and the mean wi.ng section for the two machines was 0.006 of the chord, or approximately three-eighths inch, on the upper surface, and a very little less on the lower surface.
The actual curve on the upper udace was considerably smoother than that of the Eiffel 36,

the leading edge. The mean section for the actual wings and the Eiflel 36 are plotted in figure

The difference between the mean sections for the two machines was negligible, being less
than 0.002 of the chord at every point, and less than 0.001 at most points. Airplane o. 2

one. Although the differences happened to counterbalance each other so that the mean seotions were nearly identical, the extreme divergencies between the cambers at corre ponding
points on the different wings were by no means negligible. For example, the ordinates for one
lower wing on No. · 2 were uniformly greater than those for the other lower wing on the same
macrune, the difference sometimes amounting to as much as 0.004 of the chord. It is improbable that wings can be manufactured by ordinary production methods with a greater uniformity
of section than that found in these two machines, and, even if they could be made originally
with greater accuraoy, wooden ribs will not hold their curvature exactly when submitted to
varying climatic conditions. Wind tunnel experiments indicate that the effect of changing
the camber of an aerofoil by 0.004 of the chord is seldom serious, so long as the surface retains
a smooth curvature, except in very truck sections such as are used in propeller blades and in
internally braced airplanes such as the Fokker biplane and triplane. It appeal'S to be fair to
assume that the differences in section among the wings used on these machines will have no
effect on their characteristics and that the mean section, as shown in figure 3, can be assumed
to exist at all points.
The discrepancy between the actual form of the wing section and the curve on which it
was supposed to be based points a dual lesson. In the first place, it draws attention to the
need of making wind-tunnel models to represent the airplane as it is actually built, or to be
built, not merely aecording to specifications which the shop may find itself quite unable to
follow. It is of little use to construct model aerofoils accurate to within 0.002 inch if the fullsized wing which they represent departs by as much as three-eighths of an inch from the section
which it is supposed to follow. Secondly, these measurements should serve to remind experimenters engaged in the design of wing sections of the futility of drawing forms which it is impossible to construct by ordinary methods. For instance, no airplane wing is constructed with the
upper and lower surfaces running out until they intersect in a perfectly sharp trailing edge.
Indeed, it is practically impossible to construct a model aerofoil for the wind tunnel with such
a trailing edge, yet aerofoils are repeatedly drawn up in such forms. The result is that the
model maker exercises his own judgment as to the extent to which the trailing edge should
be rounded over, the airplane builder introduces a strip of wood or of steel tube for a trailing
edge, and the drawing, the model, and the full-sized wing are likely ultimately to be of three
quite different forms.
In the JN4H, the thrust line is parallel to the top longerons and the stabilizer, which is
flat on its lower surface, lies directly on the longerons. A detailed discussion of the actual
form and setting of the tail surfaces is of interest primarily in connection with the longitudinal balance of the machine, and it will be reserved for treatment in connection with that
ubject. The wings are nominaliy set at an angle of 2° to the top longerons, but the mean
angle of incidence in both of the machines used in this work was somewhat greater than that,
being 2°.25 in No.1 and 2°.4 in No.2. The variation of incidence along the wing, due to
warping, to slightly imperfect rigging, and to the droop provided in the left wing to balance
the propeller torque, was about 0°.3. The ailerons were rigged as nearly as possible to form
a continuation of the upper wing, so that, when the stick was centered, the angles of incidence
of the portions of the upper wing which carries the ailerons were very nearly the same as for
the inner part of the wings. A small change in the rigging of the ailerons when in the neutral
position has n, marked effect on the lift and drag coefficients of the wings.
CALIBRATION OF INSTRUMENTS.

The first step in the making of any tests is necessarily a study of the accuracy and a determination of the calibration curves of the instruments employed. The standard instruments,
used in all tests, are the altimeter, the tachometer, and the air-speed roeter. The altimeter can

carried out at less than 4,000 feet altitude, the permissible percentage error in altitude determina-

tion was quite large. An error of 130 feet in the altimeter reading, or more than 4 per cent at 3,000
feet, affects the density determination by only one-half per cent. The effect of such minor factors
as the decrease of static pressure in the cockpit, due to the slip-stream velocity, can therefore
be nt'glected. It is usually possible, at the time of calibrating the altimeter, to adjt:st the
instrument so that the errors are negligible in such 'Work as this at altitudes of less than 4,000
feet, and the scale readings can therefore be used directly wi thout resort to a calibration curve.
The tachometers used were made by the Van SicIden Co., and were of the chronometric
type. No calibration of these instruments 'Was adjudged necessary, as the readings of the
instruments in the front and rear checked, and as a chronometric tachometer can generally
be counted on to give ren.c1ings very nearly correct so long as it gives any readings at all. If
anything goes wrong the instrument usually stops recording entirely.
The calibration of the air-speed meters presents a much more serious problem than docs that
of either of the instruments just discuss~d, for s~vera.l reasons. ThC're are several possible
sources of error in the air-speed determination. In the first place, the mC'ter itself may be
in error initially or may go wrong after some usc. Errors of this type can be determined by
calibration of the meter in a wind tunnel. In the second place, the pi tot or venturi tube
used for measuring the velocity head being located close to the machine and in air disturbed
by the passage of the wings the velocity of the air past this tube is, in geneml, different from
the velocity of the airplane relative to Lhe undisturbed air. For example, the \ortex thcory of sustentation declares that there is, superposed on the rectilinear flow of air relative to the wing, a
cyclic flow around the wing, so that Lhe relative air speed abo\e the wing is higher, and that
below the wing lower, than the speed through undisturbed air. An air-speed meter having
its head placed cIOS3 above the wing would therefore give too high a reading, no matter how
clos31y the instrument might have calibrated in the laboratory. Finally, the air-speed meter
will not give a perfC'ctly correct reading if the axis of the head is not parallel to the relative
wind direction at that point. Inclination of the head to the relative wind results from the
diversion of the air flow by interference, a diversion which extends to a considerable distance
forward of the wings, and also from the changing attitude of an air-speed meter head iL'{ed
in the machine as the angle of attack is altered.
ince practically all free-flight testing rcquires the determination of the air speed from It
meter the accuracy of that instrument is of great importance. In the determination of lift
coefficients, for example, an error of one-half mile an hour in the measurement of the air
speed at its mean value (about 65 miles per hour for the IN 4H) has as bad an effect on the fmal
result as would an error of 400 feet in the altitude determination. It is essential, therefore,
that the instrument be calibrated in place on the airplane and that the calibration be repeated
at intervals to guard against changes in the meter.
The air-speed meters used in these tests were Bristol instruments. They were graduated
with a division at each mile, but the scale was uniform enough and open enough so that it was
easy to estimate the reading to half a mile an hour. The heads were pitot-venturi tubes
of the standard Army type, and were mounted on the left inner forward interpln.ne strut, about
18 inches above the lower wing. The inner strut is preferable to the outer one because of the
smaller length of tubing required to make connection to the meter and also because the flow
of air at the inner strut is more nearly parallel to the plane of symmetry of the airplane, the
relative air velocity at the outer strut having a considerable component parallel to the Y axis,
which would cause the air to strike the tubes obliquely and so give false indications.
There are two classes of methods used for calibrating air-speed meters in position. The
first, much used by the British, involves the use of a camera obscura for the determination of
speed over the ground. The speed with which the image of the airplane crosses the field of
view can be measured with great accuracy, but the ground speed for It given rate of travel of
the image is directly proportional to the altitude, and the altitude must therefore be determined
within one-half per cent or better, an accuracy beyond the reach of any altimeter. The altitude
can best be determined by the use of a second camera obscura or of a theodolite in conjunction

PRELIM IN AllY nEPORT ON FREE FLIGHT TESTS.

577

with one camera obscura, the vertical angles of the plane as seen from two different points at
the instant when it crosses a line connecting those two points giving the necessary data for
computing the altitude. The eiIect of the wind can be determined and corrected for either
by measuring the velocity of a puff of smoke fired from the airplane or by flying across the
field of view in three different directions, one after the other, and measuring the ground speed
in each direction. There is only one camera obscura at Langley Field, and it was not deemed
advisable to secure another. The camera obscura therefore has not been used for calibrating
the air-speed meters in these tests.
The second method, and the one so far used in the work of the ational Advisory Committee, is simpler and more direct, requiring only the timing of the airplane over a measured course.
The course laid off at Langley Field is 5,600 feet long, and two horizontal wires, one directly
above the other and about 3 feet apart, are carried on poles at each end. One of these observing stations is shown in figure 5. The airplane was flown over the course at an altitude of from
200 to 1,000 feet, the higher altitudes generally being used at the lower speeds, where there
was some danger of stalling or side slipping or starting a spin. The pilot kept the speed as
nearly constant as possible and the observer recorded the air-speed meter reading every 5
seconds. Two or three runs were made in each direction at each speed, the speeds at which
the meter was calibrated being spaced about 5 miles per hour from the maximum down to the
mlrumum. The ground speed of each run is determined by observers at the ends of the course,
the two stations being in telephonic communication. The effect of the wind is eliminated,
assuming that its direction and velocity do not change between runs, by computing the mean air
speed for successive runs made approximately at the same speed and plotting it against the
mean ground speed for the same runs. This method is much more satisfactory, when the
pilot is skillful enough to make his runs at
air speeds very nearly uniform and close
to the desired speeds, than any attempt
to measure the component of wind velocity

DETERMINATION OF LIFT AND DRAG COEFFICIENTS: METHODS EMPLOYED.

It is very desirable that data be obtained on the lift and drag in free flight of full-3ized airplanes and parts thereof, in order that the designer may gain some knowledge as to the con'ections to be applied to wind-tunnel results and as to the extent to which those result can be
trusted. The problem i an extremely difficult one for many rea on , some of which will be discussed in detail later on in this report, and the work which has 0 far been done leaves much that
is uncertain and many questions the olution of which can not even be attempted until new
types of instruments D more accurate experimental methods have been devised.
,nd
There are three methods which have been ugge ted and employed to some extent for finding the lift in flight. The first two permit of the determination of the lift of eparate parts (in
particular, the wings), while the third, the simple t, and the only one which ha been used in the
work done at Langley Field, gives only the lift coefficients for the airplane a a whole. The fiT t
and most obvious of the e methods propos~s the mea urement of the lift of any part by the
interposition of weighing devices between that part and the remainder of the all.'plane. For
example, the wing hinge might be attached to the body trn:ough the medium of pring~ .
There has been a great deal of discussion of the po sibilitie of thi method, but the mechanical
difficulties are considerable, and not much actual work ha been done. The second method
depends on the measurement of the pres ure at a large number of points on the surface of the
wings (and, if de ired, on the tail of the body) and the determination. of the total lift by the
integration of these pressures over the whole surface. This has been used to some 'extent
in England, and similar work is planned for Langley Field during the coming year. The pressures can be measured, once the apparatus is satisfactorily constructed, with great ease and accl.l-

racy, and the only errors to which the method is subject are those inherent in all free-flight
measurements.
The third method is, as was just noted, the simplest, in that it requires the least special
apparatus.

In the equation L = Lc X ~ X V2 it is known that L is equal to the weight of the ma-

chine when the flight path is horizontal, and that it departs only very slightly from that figure
for any ordinary inclination of the path (short of a steep dive). Since p can be computed from
measurements of the pressure and temperature, the determination of Lc requires only the measrement of V. As a matter of fact, since the air-speed meter records not the true speed but the
product of V X .J p/Po, the term p/g can be eliminated by the substitution of indicated for true air
Speed, and the equation above can be written:

L=LoCV21
Where C is a correction constant taking into account the gravity constant g and the conversion
factor changing VI from miles per hours to feet per second. Although a small part of the lift is
due to the body and the tail surfaces have a substantial effect at some angles, it is convenient to
divide the lift by the wing area and write the above equation in the form

L=L cCAV21
With a good meter and careful calibration the air speed can certainly be determined with an
error of less than 1 mile per hour and probably less than t mile per hour, and the lift coefficient
at any given instant during a flight can therefore be computed very accurately. In substituting for L in the characteristic equation, allowance has to be made for the progressive diminution of weight by the comsumption of fuel and for the direct balancing of part of the weight
of the machine by the vertical component of the propeller thrust.
Since the lift coefficient is a function of angle of attack, it is of very little use to compute the
value of the coefficient at any instant during a flight unless this angle at the same instant is
known, and it is in the determination of tbis angle that tho greatost difficulties arise. The conventional type of "incidenco indicator," ombodying a pivoted vane and two Pitot tubes at a considerable ang~e to each other or a sphere pierced with two holos, is useless unless some other means is
employed to calibrate it in position, as tho instrument has to be placed in air dist.urbed by the
passage of the airplane, and the motion of the instrument relati,o to this disturbed air, as already
noted in connection with the calibration of the air-speed meters, may bo of quito a different
nature from its motion relative to the air at a groat distance. Tho disturbance of the airby the
wings extends to so great a distanco (three or four chord lengths) in front of the leading edge
'that it is impracticable to carry the incidonce indicator far enough forward entirely to escape
this disttirbance.
Since the angle of attack is the inclination of the wings to the relative wind, it is equal to
the difference between the inclination of the wings to any fixed reference plane and the inclination
of the relative wind to the same plane. In particular, the angle of attack can be determined if
instruments are available which will give the angles between any line fixed in the airplane
and the horizontal and between the relative wind and the horizontal. The first of the these angles
is given, provided that the machine is in steady rectilinear flight, by a liquid longitudinal inclinometer. The second can not readily be determined directly, but the inclination of the flight
path to the horizontal is given by a rate-of-climb meter in conjunction with an air- peed motel',
and this is equivalent to the inclination of the relative wind if the movement of the air is
exactly horizontal. In the particular case where the flight path is level the rate-of-climb meter
can be replaced by a statoscope. The largest orror in the determination of angle of attack by
this method arises from the assumption that the air moves only horizontally. An ascending
current having a velocity of only 1 foot per second changes the angle of attack, for a given
attitude of the machine relative to the earth, by nearly 0°.7 at an air speed of 60 miles per
hour. This is a very gentle ascending cun·ent, ane! it will be shown later that vertical currents
which have actually been encountered during these exp~riments have affected the apparent angle
of attack by more than 1°.
The statoscope usod is shown in figure 9. The tube was kept separato from the vacuum
flask, instead of mounting both in one case as is customary, in order that the flask might be

placed behind the instrument board and the space occupied on tho board be kept down to a
minimum. The use of the statoscope makes it practicable to keep the mean rate of climb or
descent down to 20 feet per minute except at very large angles of attack, and a rate of climb
of 20 feet per minute affects the angle of attack at 60 mile per hour by loss than 0°.25.
The ordinary commercial type of longhudinal inclinometer proved unsatisfactory, f1rst,
because the scale was not open enough to permit the angles to be read as closely as was desired,
and, second, because the face of the instrument was perpendicular to the instrument board. The
obser'\er's eye being well above the board, the observer looked down on top of the meniscus and
across it at the scale behind, and the parallax error was large. An instrument was designed to
ob'\iate these difficulties, and is shown assembled in figure 10. Figure 11 illustrates the tube
removed from the case. The front tube and scale make an angle of 20 ° with the surface which
rests against the instrument board. The mean distance between the two surfaces of the column
of liquid is 8 inches. The scale is divided in degrees, the divisions being roughly one-eighth
inch apart, and it is easy to estimate to 0°.1. The liquid is a mixture of glycerin and alcohol,
cJlored with red ink. The damping of oscillations depends on the viscosity of the liquid, and
tills can be controlled by varying the proportions of alcohol and glycerin. The tube is constricted at one point to increase the damping. Parallax was avoided by mounting a mirror
beside the instrument, the observer bringing the reflection of his eve in line with the meniscus.
It unfortunately has not been possible to base the measure~ents of the drag entirely on
data obtained in flight, as no satisfactory means of measuring the propeller thrust is available
as yet. It is therefore necessary to rely on a wind tunnel test for the propeller characteristics.
A partial check can be obtained on the wind tunnel results by measuring the slip-stream velocity, as described in another section of the report. Knowing the revolutions per minute and
the true air-speed, the value of

the velocity of the vertical CUlTent and to the L/D ratio, inversely proportional to the speed of
flight. If the rising current had a vertical velocity of 11 feet per second, the air speed and L/D
being the arne as before, no thrust would be required and the machine would soar without
engine power. Such currents as this seldom if ever exist, but rising and falling currents of
smaller velocities are almost omnipresent. They account for many seemingly wild results in
thi and other similar work, and the only way to eliminate their effects is to run a great number
of tests of th same sort, under all light and weather conditions and over as many different types
of terrain as possible, and then average the results.
Figure 13 hows the instrument board in the observer's cockpit of Jo. J, with inclinometer,
air- peed meter, altimeter, and tachometer installed. The altimeter docs not appear in this
photograph, being hidden behind the cowling at the right. The arrangement in No.2 is praetically the same.
The tests were carried out at altitudes varying from 1,500 to 4,000 feet. It was not considered safe, in view of the danger of falling into a spin when flying at large angles and of the
possibility of a fore dlanding, to work below the former altitude. The altitude chosen on any
particular day depends chiefly on ail' conditions, the climb being continued far enough to escape
the 1/ bump" frequently found near the ground. Each 1/ run" continued for from 1 to 2 minutes, the pilot being instructed to fly level (using the statoscope to detect changes in altitude)
and at a constant air speed during that period. The observer read and recorded the readings of
the air-speed meter, the inclinometer and the tachometer every 10 seconds, and noted the altimeter reading and the ail' temperature at the beginning of each run. The pilot's task was a
very difficult one, for he had constantly to watch the stato cope and air-speed meter, in addition to holding the machine steady laterally and watching out for other airplanes. Besides
all thi , when flying over the speed course to calibrate the meter the pilot had to steer a straight
course over the groun 1 between the two observing stations. Test flying is a very highly specialized branch of work, the difficulties of which are not generally appreciated, and there is no type
of flying in which a difference between the abilities of pilots t.horoughly competent in ordinary
flying becomes more quickly apparent. Most of the pilotino- for the committee has been done
by Mr. E. T. Allen and Lieut. H. M. Cronk, but seven other pilots have been used on one or more
occasions.
In order to determine the minimum speed in steady flight and to secure data for comparison
with wind tunnel te t over the whole range of angles cu tomarily covered by the latter, it was
necessary to fly horizontally at an angle at least equal to the angle of maximum lift and as much
larger as possible. The procedure in attaining the e high angles was to throttle the engine to
the lowest speed at which level flight could be maintained, and then open the throttle gradually.
drawing the stick back at the arne time. The airplane can thus be flown level in a very badly
stalled condition, the action of the longitudinal ctmtrols being reversed (i. e., if the machine is
losing altitude it is necessary to decrease the angle of attack, pushing the stick forward, in order
to ascend) . Furthermore, the airplane is very unstable laterally at angles in excess of 12 0 or
13 0 , and it is prone to fall off into side slips. Mo t pilots, in trying to fly at extremely high
angles for the first time, are unable to keep the machine in equilibrium for more than a few
seconds. One of the pilots flying for the committee, after considerable practice, became very
skillful in this work and found it possible, given favorable weather conditions, to maintain
steady level flight for an indefinite period with the throttle wide open and the machine stalled
to an angle of attack of 18 0 or a little more. The ailerons alone are very ineffective in maintaining rateral stability at large angles, as any raising of one aileron greatly diminishes the drag
on that portion of the wing, while drawing down the other aileron correspondingly increases the
drag there. The result is that a large yawing moment, nearly if not quite sufficient to overcome
the effect of the rolling moment due to the ailerons, is produced and tends to Jorce the machine
into a spin. It is necessary constantly to use the rudder in conjunction with the ailerons to a
considerably larger extent than i nece aTY at normal angles.

RESULTS OF THE TESTS FOR LIFT COEFFICENTS.

A number of te ts (about 10) were Illitde on each airplane.
orne of these have not been
plotted up or included in the averages, either because they were not extended over a large
enough range of angles or because they contained re ults which were self-contradictory or because it was found, when an attempt was made to work them up, that essential data were lacking. In selecting t ests to be incorporated in the final tabulation no attempt was made to pick
those which would check well with each other, and the results were not even compared until the
final choice had been made and the computations completed. In order to indicate the degree
of consi tency obtained among the various factors on succe sive ob ervations in ono typical
flight, the angle of attack, as determined by the inclinometer, is plotted against the indicated
air speed in figure 14. As already noted, observations on the two instruments were taken

throughout. The very large discrepancy between these thr e andlthe fourth at large angles may be
explained by the failure of the pilot in the July 30 test to hold the path level. In seeking to fly
at the lowest possible speed, he probably allowed the machine to settle or' 'pancake," so that
the true lift was less than the weight of the airplane.
The mean lift curves for o. 1 and No.2 are brought together in figure 16. The difference
between the two is unfortunately not so small as that between the curves for the various tests on
a single machine, and the reason for the discrepancy is not apparent. The difference between
the two machines certainly is not great enough to account for it, although the reserve tank in
the upper wing of No.1 might affect the lift by a small amount. However, even if the difference between the two lift curves be regarded as wholly due to error in the ex.periments, the two
are nearly enough alike to indicate the general form of the curve and to permit of interesting
rleductions.

PRELIMIN ARY REPORT ON FREE FLIGHT TESTS.

The most important result that can be drawn from such work as this relates to the comparison between free-flight and wind-tunnel results. It has not been possible as yet to h ave an
accurate model of the JN4H made up for wind-tunnel test, but a great deal of work has been done
on the J 21, and this can be used as a basis of comparison. The J N2 has an Eiffel 36 wing-section, like the IN 4H, but it differs from the latter in that its wings ar e of equal span a..nd in a number of other details. The JN2 h as a larger down load on the tail than has the 4H, as will be
shown in connection with the discussion of balance, and the actual lift of the wings must therefor e be great er . It would th en be expected, other things being equal, that the lift coefficients
here computed, which ignore the tail load entirely, would be a little smaller for the 2 than for
the 4H, but the difference would hardly exceed 3 per cent.

FIGURE 16.

The lift coefficient for the JN2 model and the mean coefficient for the two full-sized machines
are given in figure 17. The coefficients for the model, like those for the full-sized machine, ar£
based on the lift of the whole airplane and not on that of the wings alone. The two curve.;; rur
fairly close together up to 6°, although the lift of the model is distinctly the larger, even when allowance is made for the effect of the difference in tail load just mentioned. The model lift coeffi·
cient at angles below 6° is larger than that given by the free-flight tests for either No.1 or No.2.
At angles in excess of 6° the model lift coefficient begins to drop off rapidly by comparison with the
free-flight values. The burble point for the former comes at an angle nearly 4 ° smaller than that
for the latter, and its maximum lift is about 15 per cent less, so that the minimum speed, or, as itis
usually called, Ian cling speed, computed from the model test, would be three miles an hour higher
than that found by experiment. Actually, however, the model test gives the practicable land1

ing speed more closoly than dof's the free-flight t est, for the customary angle of attack in a good
landing is about 12°, an angle at which the lift coefficient is almo texactly equal to the maximum
lift coefficient of the model. In order to land the machines which were the suhject of these te ts
at the lowe t speed at which they can be flown, the tail skid would have to touch the ground
while the wheels were still 16 inches above its surface (assuming the downward slope of the
flight path at the instant of making contact to be 2°). As every pilot will recognize, a landing in
such an attitude would be distinctly unu ual, to say the lf'ast. As has already been pointed out,
it requires excf'ptional skill to fly at angle of 15 ° or more, and it would not he safe for any pilot
to attempt it near the ground. It is, therefore, evident that the burble point is of very little
practical interest in airpl ane design, a iL is improJ able that any pilot ever flies his machine at
that angle voluntarily except for a very brief interval in the cour e of a stunt or when testing for

water (Hampton Roads) at a maximum distance of about a mile from the land and others, at
nearly the same speeds, over the land. When the result were worked up it was found that the
runs over the water and those over the land gave two di tinct sets of cur,es, and that the angle
of attack for a speed of 78 miles per hour was greater by 1° on the fust set than on the second.
This leads to the conclusion that the air was descending over the water or ascending over the
land or both, and that the vertical velocity of the air in one place relative to that in the other
was 120 feet per minute. This is undoubtedly an exceptional condition, as subsequent tests,
although they frequently showed a difference in angle with the kind of country over which the
machine was passing, indicated no other vertical velocitie a large as that just mentioned. It
should be noted that the flight just described took place in the morning, on a sunny clay, and that
all the observations were taken at a height of 2,700 feet.

Over the land checked well with the other tests on the same machine it is probable that the
vertical velocity there was not very large, and that most of the relative movement deduced was
due to a downward motion of nil' over the bay, or at least over that portion of it covered by

PRELIMINARY REPORT ON FREE FLIGHT TESTS.

A much disputed question relates to the effect of ·the slip-stream on the lift of an airplane.
Although no attempt at quantitative measurements in inclined flight has as yet been made, the
minimum speed attainable has been observed under various conditions of engine operation, and
no indir-ation of a marked slip-stream effect on lift has been apparent. SOllie such effect probably
exists, but it is certainly small. The minimum speed with throttle wide open is, to be sure, somewhat less than the minimum speed in gliding, but the difference is not too large to be accounted
for by the lesser total lift in the first case, due to the vertical component of the thrust-balancing
part of the weight of the machine directly.
RESULTS OF TH,E TESTS FOR DRAG COEFFICIE TS.

In working up the results of the tests for drag the procedure followed was in general analogous to that just described for lift. The primary curve, corresponding to the plot of inclinometer
r eadings against speed, was one of Nri against angle or speed (usually the latter).

Such a curve

for a single flight is given in figure 18, each point representing a .single pair of readings (of airspeed meter and tachometer). It will be noted that the points do not lie on the curve with any
such exactness as do those in figure 14, and that they separate into little groups. Each group
of points includes the readings taken during a run in a straigh t line and at an approximately
constant speed, and each group defines a little curve of its own, the slopes of these short subsidiary
curves being considerably greater than that of the mean curve connecting them. This apparent
discrepancy is due eo the inertia of the airplane, which causes it to delay appreciably in responding to changes of condition. For

The dilierence between successive tests was, as would be expected, greater than in the case
of the lift coefficient, both because of the very large effect of vertical currents and because of the
failure of the pilots in some cases to keep the path level. The extreme result for a given angle,
however, seldom varied by more than 10 per cent. The errors in the determination are much
greater at very large and at very small angles than at those in the neighborhood of the maximum
LID, partly because there were few tests which extended to very large angles. Even those tests
which covered the full range of angles spread out widely at the ends of the curves, although very
closely bunched in the intermediate portion. There was, as will be seen a little later, a marked
dilierence between the results for the two machines, exceeding 10 per cent for a considerable
range of angles. This difference can be attributed largely to the dilierence in the propeller , a
Jifference already noted in the first part of the report, and it is probable that, since the propeller
used on No.2 was the more warped, the results given for the drag and LID on No.1 are more
accurate than are those for No.2. A 'test was made with the propellers interchanged, and the
r esults obtained from No.2 on that occasion checked very well with the mean curve for No. 1.
The mean curves of thru~t for the two machines are given in figure 19. These curves call
for no special comment, their general form being evident. The thrust for a given angle varies

represent the average condition in the J in level flight satisfactorily. The thrust given in these
curves is that corresponding to standard atmospheric density.
The curves of horsepower required for level flight at tandard density are given in figure 20.
The curve for horsepower available is plotted on the same sheet, its form being based on the
efficiency curve for the propeller, as determined at Leland Stanford Junior, and on the computed
variations of engine speed with air speed, the throttle remaining wide open at all times and the
engine torque being assumed constant. In order to make the intersection of the curves check
with the maximum speed as determined by test it was necessary to take the engine horsepower
as 130 (a value which appears reasonable, as the engines had seen a considerable amount of
service and would not turn up beyond 1,530 revolutions per minute in level flight with the propeller
normally used on o. I , or 1,570 revolutions per minute with that used on Jo. 2). It will be
noted that the curves of horsepower available and required have their second intersection at an
angle a little smaller than the burble point. This checks very well with the observed fact that,

587

with the throttle wide open and the machine :Bying level, it was not quite possible to reach the
burble point. This i shown by the mean lift curves, which stop just short of the critical angle.
This coincidence of computed and observed results at the lower end of the horsepower curve
affords additional reason for confidence in the validity of the method employed for using windtunnel data on the propeller in conjunction with measurements on the complete airplane in free
:Bight.

The air speed for be t climb is deduced from the horsepower curves to be 56 miles per hour.
No thorough tests on climb have been marle, but the air speeds adopted by the pilots who have :Bown
these macmnes, when they desired a maximum r ate of ascent, have ranged from 4 to 57 miles per
hour, with the most skillful and e.xperienced pilots, in most cases, choosing a speed nearer to 48 than
to to 57, It appears, then, that the air speed which would be recommended as a r esult of the study of
the curves of figure 20 is very nearly correc t, but probably a little on the high side. This is rather
surprising, as the effect of the increased slip-stream velocity with the machine climbing with
wide-open till'ottle 'would presumably be to raise the speed for minimum horsepower required,
and the speed for best climb predicted from these curves would therefore be expected to be a
little low. In any case, however, the discrepancy is small, and the climbing speed is so nearly
the same for all speeds from 50 to 60 miles per hour that the difference can hardly be detected.
The climbing speed for No.1 is computed from the horsepower curves to be 585 feet a minute .

A NUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERO AUTICS.

Although, as already noted, no accurate determinations of the r ate of climb have been made, such
observations as have been taken indicate a maximum rate some,,-hat less than 5 5 feet a minute.
This is what would be expected, the difference being due to the increased slip-stream effect with
open throttle. The curve of horsepower required computed from the JN2 model test, with due
allowance for the difference in weight between the J 2 and the J 4H, is also plott d in figure 20.
It checks well with the free flio-ht curves except at extrem.e high and low speeds. From the curves
of thrust those for L ID can be derived, and the mean curves for the j;'I\'o machines, tog ther with
that for the JN2 model referred to in connection with the lift coeflicient. , are given in figure 21 .
The curves for TO. 1 and o. 2 are nearly parallel except at small angle , wher there appears
a marked difference of slope similar to that which characterized the lift curves. Bearing in
mind the fact that the curve for ro . 1 is undoubtedly more accurate than that for TO . 2, it is
apparent that the correspondence between the L/D for the J 2 model and that determined
in free flight for the J 4H is reasonably good. It is rather dangerous to draw fme conclusions
een the J 2 and the JN4H, but the sepafrom this correspondence, in view of the difference bet\\7
ration between the curves is hardly greater at any point than the combined possible experimental
errors,· and the maxima di-ITer by only 2 per cent (if the curve for o. 1 btl taken as correct) .
The indication is that the slip-str am eiIect and the val'ious crudities of construction on the model
( uch as the use of round wire interpl ane struts) are almost exactly counterbalanced by the
"scale effect" and by tho effect of the omissions of wires, fittings, otc., from the model. In
order to obtain quantitative data on the slip-str am eiIoct tests in inclined flight will be necessary.
VELOCITIES IN THE SLIP STREAM.

slip stream were both connected to the same meter through the medium of two valves, \\-hich
made it possible to change readily from one to the other, and to read the air speed or slip-stream
velocity, as might be desu·ed. The readings secured in this way are, of course, not highly accurate, as the slip-stream velocity includes a considerable tangential component, the magnitude of
this swll'l varying with the air speed and engine speed. The au' therefore meets the tubes obliquely, and the reading of the meter is probably lower than the true velocity. The errol' in
velocity should not, however, be more than 5 per cent, and the results obtained will at least
serve to give an idea of the relation between slip-stream velocity and the factors which control it .
The procedure in these tests was to set the throttle at a fL.'md position, and to fly the machine at a number of different air speeds without moving the throttle (these flights, of cours ,
were not level). The air speeds used for each throttle setting ranged from 90 to 42 miles per
hour, with an occasional dive to 100 miles per hour or a little more. The ratio of slip-stream
velocity to air speed for a given propeller depends only on :D and these quantities can therefore
be plotted against each other. This has been done in figure 22, and it will be noted that nearly an
of the points lie close to a smooth curve and that there is no distinct break between the sets of
points taken at different throttle openings. The only points which do not fit the curve are those
which were taken with the engine throttled down to a very low speed, so low that the propeller
was giving no thrust. The slip-stream velocities under this condition were lower than they
apparently should have been.
The dotted curve in figure 22 represents the velocity ratio computed from the thrust coefficients by the method described in Report No. 71. This curve checks very welj 'w ith the other
one, and this check indicates that the thrust coefficients as determined in the wind tunnel
held for the full-sized machine, and that they· are not very materially affected by the pre ence
of the body. Of course, this check is only a rough one. To secure an accurat.e comparison
between the theoretical and actual values it would be necessary to ,sound the slip-stream thoroughly, measuring the velocities at many points, but previous experiments (by Eifl'el and others)
indicate that the velocit,y is nearly constant over a large portion of the propeller disk area, and
readings at a single point therefore give some indication of the average condition. It appears
that interference between the propener and the other parts of the airplane can not have a very
large effect, as any very notable increase in thrust due to the presence of the body would lead
to an increased slip-stream velocity. Experiments at the Royal Aircraft Factory 1 on a pusher
biplane, have shown a similarly excellent check between the calculated and measured slipstream velocities.
The maximum lip-stream velocity with the machine stationary on the ground and the
engine turning 1,400 revolutions per minute was about 80 miles per hour. The velocity was
very unsteady under the conditions, the meter reading varying by about 6 miles per hour
almost instantaneously. This irregularity of flow was no doubt due in part to interference
of the ground, but the flow in the slip-stream was in general more irregular, and the velocity
fluctuated more rapidly and through a iarger range at low speeds than at high.
LONGITUDINAL BALANCE.

The factor on which the longitudinal balance of an airplane primarily depends, and to any
variation in which it is always highly sen itive, is the position of the center of gravity of the machine. The first step, then, in any study of balance and of the aetion of the controls is to determine as accurately as possible the position of the C. G. with regard both to its vertical and its
horizontal co-ordinates.
The method used in finding the location of the center of gravity was the usual one of
weighing the machine on three pairs of s ales, one under each wheel and one under the tail
skid, first with the tail skid and wheels on the same level and then with the tail raised. The

tail can be raised enough, without overbalancing the machine, to rotate it tlu'ough an angle
of about 15° when the pilot and ob erver are on board and through 10° when the seats are
empty. From the weights thus obtained the center of gravity can be computed with a probable error of less than 0.01 foot in the horizontal co-ordinate and less than 0.03 foot in the vertical.
With a pilot weighing 125 pounds in the front seat and a 165-pound observer in the rear
(this being the crew with which most of the tests were conducted), the center of gravity of o. 1
was 1.04 feet behind the leading edge of the lower wing, 2.50 feet behind the leading edge of
the upper wing, and 0.2 foot above the thrust line, the axe of reference being taken parallel
and perpendicular to the top longeron. The center of gravity of o. 2 wa 0.99 foot behind
the leading edge of the lower wing, 2.44 feet behind the leading edge of the upper wing, and 0.2
foo t above the thrus t line. The ob erver in No.2 weighed only 125 pounds. If the mean chord
be taken a 60 per cent of the way from the lower to the upper chord to allow for the larger
area and larger unit lift of the upper wing, the line through the C. G. and perpendicular to the
wing chords cuts thi mean chord at 39 per cent of it length from its leading edge on o. 1 and
35 per cent on o. 2. Till i materially farther back on the wing than the usual location
for the C. G.
ince the balance depends on ·moments about the C. G., a small change of force on the tail
plane, acting a it does at a large moment arm, has an important effect, and the angle of the
tabilizer i therefore of primary importance. As already noted in the general descriptions of
the machine, the stabilizer is upposed to lie flat on the upper longeron. Although the stabilizer were warped the mean chord of the UTface was parallel to the top longerons within
0°.2 on both macillnes.
In order to determine the angle at which the elevator was set at any instant, a sector carrying a scale was fixed to the elevator rocker-arm haft in the rear cockpit of No.1, and this sector moved under a pointer fixed to the seat rail. No means of mea UTing the control position
were provided on o. 2, as the arrangement of the elevator-control linkage was different on the
two machines, and an entirely new and somewhat more complicated device would have had to
be designed. The elevator control wires were adjusted somewhat more tightly than is usual
in order to prevent any backlash. The elevator position indicator i shown in position in
figUTe 23.
The force applied to the stick was measUTed by the in trument illustrated in figUTe 24.
The knob which normally caps the stick was removed, and the lide held between two springs
was slipped over the head of the tube. The pilot read the forces directly from the scale. The
force indicator was originally fitted with two springs of equal strength, but, as it wa found
that the force wa practically always in one direction, the spring hown in the cut were
ubstituted.
The elevator po itions for a variety of air peeds and engine speed are given by the CUTves
of figUTe 25. These CUTve were obtained in the same way as were the point on the slip-stream
CUTve (fig. 22), each one relating to a fixed throttle setting: A iL-xed throttle setting, rather
than a fixed engine power or number of revolutions per minute, i the criterion to which longitudinal balance and tability should be related.
Indicated air-speed (with the speed course correction made) is used diroctly as the basi
for plotting the curves, and variations of air density during the test are entirely neglected.
The elevator angles and forces depend primarily on indicated air-speed, since the angle of attack
and the flow of air about the machine are functions only of the indicated air-speed and the
slope of the :!light path. The air density affects the controls in two ways, but both are of minor
importance. In the first place, the slope of the :!light path for a given throttle setting and
indicated air-speed varies with the air density. This factor is insignificant.
econdly, the
velocity of the slip-stream and its effect on the controls depend on the true speed and so on the
density. This effect, although it is of greater magnitude than the one first mentioned, can
safely be neglected except for the large changes of destiny experienced in mounting to great
altitudes. All the tests described here were carried out at between 1,500 and 4,000 feet.

Curve No.1 relat.es to flight with wide-open throttle, o. 5 to gliding descent with the
engine throttled down to idling speed. The elevator angle is referred to the top longerons as a
datum line, and is taken as positive when the trailing edge of the elevator is pulled down. It
will be observed that the curves all have the same general form, and that t.he positive angle of
elevator setting for equilIbrium at any given speed decreases progressively as the engine speed
decreases. This is due to the slip-stream effect on the stabilizer and to the location of the
center of gravity above the thrust line, both of these things tending to cause the airplane to
nose down to a smaller angle of incidence as the throttle is closed and therefore requiring that
the elevator be pulled up in order to maintain the same angle of attack and the same air-speed.
Translated into practical terms, this means that, if the stick were lo cked in position whilfl the

nose of the airplane would drop, and would continue to go down at least until the speed of t.he
dive reached 90 miles per hour, and probably until the airplane passed the vertical and attained
an up-side-down position. It is, of course, desirable that the nose should drop when the engine
is throttled or cut oft completely ratheT than that the machine should stall, but it is also desirable that the nosing down process should stop at a determinate point instead of continuing
indefinitely. An airplane ideally balanced and ideally stable would continue at some speed
within its normal range and at a normal inclination of path, with the longitudinal control locked
whatever might be done to the throttle. '1'he condition of locked control, of course, is only one
of several which may occur. Others, even more important, will be discussed later in this
section.

It is characteristic of the curves of figure 25 that they have a maximum point, and that
their slopes at high and low air-speeds are accordingly of opposite sign. The effect of this
change of slope can best be illustrated by two concrete examples. If an airplane is flying with
the throttle setting corresponding to curve No.3, and at a speed of .65 miles per bour, and if
the stick is then suddenly pushed forward by an amount sufficient to increase the elevator
angle by 0°.2 and locked in tills new position, the primary effect will be to nose the airplane
down, decreasing the angle of incidence and increasing the speed, since the pulling down of the
elevator sets up an unbalanced upward force on the tail, and this gives rise to a diving moment
about the center of gravity. By the time the speed has increased to 80 miles per hour the
proper elevator setting for equilibrium is 0°.7, but the surface is locked at 1°.2. There is,
therefore, still an unbalanced diving moment, larger now than before, and the speed continues
to increase with a const,a ntly steepening path. Manifestly this is an unstable condition, and
it may be dangerous if the pilot is not vigilant. Suppose, on the other hand, that the initial
speed was 50 miles per hour, this being less than that corresponding to the maximum elevator
angle, and that the elevatol' was pulled down O. 2° and locked as before. The:first effect, just
as in the other r;:ase, is to decrease the angle of incidence and increase the speed. By the time
the speed has increased about 1 mile per hour, however, a point is reached where the machine
is in equilibrium with the new elevator setting, and it will then continue in steady flight at this
slightly higher speed: Gusts which change the angle of attack of the airplane have just the
same effect as a sudden change in the angle of the elevator. If an airplane which is flying
with the control locked at a speed corresponding to the negatively sloping portion of the elevator
position curve is struck by a gust which decreases its angle of attack the angle will continue
to decrease without limit. If the speed is low enough to lie on the positively sloping portion
of the curve the airplane will return to its original speed and angle of trim as soon as the effect
of the gust has passed. A positive slope therefore makes for longitudinal stability. It will
be noted that the range of speed for stable flight with fixed controls and fixed throttle setting
becomes wider in general as the engine speed is decreased, and that, for the lowest curve (engine
idling), there is no sharp negative slope at any point. With the throttle wide open, on the other
hand, the machine is unstable for practically the whole speed range.
An ideal set of elevator position curves would have a small positive slope at all points,
and the curves for different throttle settings would be parallel and close together.
uch a
set is shown in figure 26 for comparison with the actual curves of figure 25. It is not desirable to have the positive slope very large at any point, as a machine characterized by such
curves is difficult to control quickly, requiring the application of a larger force, and the moving
of the stick through a longer arc, than is desirable to change the angle of attack. The stability with fixed controls can always be controlled by movement of the center of gravity, the
stability being greatest when the C. G. is farthest forward with respect to the wings.
The sudden reversal of the slopes of the curves in figure 25, and the rapidity with which
the elevator setting changes at low speeds, are due to the change of the center of pressure travel
on the wings. This travel becomes less unstable as the angle increases and the effect, when
combined with the movements due to the tail, is to give to the whole machine a high degree of
statical longitudinal stability at low speeds.
At all speeds ordinarily used the elevator angle decreases as the angle of attack decreases,
so that it is necessary to hold the stick farther back to fly at high than at moderate speed.
Of course, it is not possible to go directly from one condition to the other, as, for instance, to
decrease the angle of attack by pulling the stick back while flying in equilibrium at a moderate
speed. The effect in that case would be the opposite of the one desired, and it is necessary,
when the angle is to be decreased, first to push the stick forward, nosing the machine down
until' the desired angle is reached, and then to pull it a little farther back than its original position in order to keep the machine in the attitude thus assumed.

PRELIMINARY REPORT ON FREE FLIGHT TESTS.

For the sake of comparison the curve of elevator angles for a JN2 has been computed
from tests made at the wind tunnel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1 and is given
in figure 27 together with a reproduction of the curve for the JN4H with the engine idling.
In computing the curve for the model the center of gravity was assumed to be in the same
position with regard to the mean chord of the wings as in JN4H No. 1. The differences between
the JN2 and the JN4H are not of a nature which would be expected materially to affect the
balance and stability, except that the stabilizer on the former is set at - 3 ° to the wing chord,
while that on the latter is at -2°.3. This accounts for a part, but only a part, of the relative
displacement of the two curves. It will be noted that the m~del test would have led to a prediction of tail-heaviness, the opposite of the condition existing. This difference can be attributed

to the fact that the tail of the model was made up as a flat plate cut from sheet metal and the
difference between inclinations of the zero lift lines of the stabilizers in the model and the fullsized machine was therefore much greater than was the difference in the settings of their chords.
The large error in balance reSUlting from this error in tail construction points again to the
necessity of minute accuracy in constructing the sustaining and control surfaces of wind tunnel
models.
The two curves of figure 27 are of almost exactly the same form and it appears probable
that, were it not for the error noted above, they would be close enough together so that the
balance of the air plane and the control position in gliding flight, when there is no slip-stream
effect, could be closely predicted from the model test. The present experiments and others
of a similar nature on many different types of machines will provide the necessary data for

correcting the wind tunnel re ults for slip-stream effect and so for predicting the balance of an
airplane at full power before it is built.
The discussion 0 far ha been confined to the case of stability with locked controls. Till
of course, is rather an uncommon case at present as very few machine, e pecially of nonmilitary
type, are fitted with mean for locking the tick in position. The provi ion of a device for this
purpo e is highly desirable from ome standpoints, and may become the usual thing at somC'
future date, but there are other cases which, a already noted, are of more importance at present .
If the elevator is left free and uncontrolled it 'will take up a po ition in which there is a
small moment about the elevator hinge, due to the air forces acting on the urface, tending to
decrease the angle. This corresponds to an upward force on the elevator and is required to
balance the weight of the member, which produces a moment tending to increase the angle
pounds at the top of the stick,
of setting. In the machines used in the e tests a force of
corresponding to a moment about t;he elevator hinge of 206 pound-inches, was required to hold
the" flippers" up in the neutral position. A force of 1 pound at the upper end of the stick
balances a moment; of 24.2 pound-inches about the elevator hinge. In plotting the results of
the tests the force on the stick and the moment about the elevator hinge have both been plotted
as ordinates against air speed.
ince the ratio between the forces and the moments is fixed
a single curve suffices for both by a proper adjustment of scales.
Before di cussing in detail the curves of control force, a digres ion on the definition of nose
heavine s and tail heavine s is appropriate, as these terms constantly enter into any que tion of
longitudinal balance. An airplane may be, and has been, defined as in perfect balance (neither
nose heavy nor tail heavy) either (a) when the pilot does not need to applJ any force to the stick
to keep the machine in equilibrium under the particular conditions in q nestion, (b) when there is
no moment about the elevator hinge, or (c) when the airplane flies in equilibrium with the
elevator forming a prolongation of the stabilizer. The first of these d3finitions is generally the
most satisfactory, and will be used here, as i(; rela(;es to what the pilot is primarily intere bed in,
the muscular force required to fly the machine steadily. Its only important disadvantage is
that it makes too much depend on the weight of the elevators, a very minor and ea ily changed
factor of design, to be really de irable from a scientific point of view. The second of the three
definitions suggested would be better from this standpoint.
The curves of force and moment on the elevators of o. 1 for various throttle setting are
given in figure 28, those for o. 2 in figure 29. The positive ign corresponds to a pull on the
stick, holding the elevator up against a downward force. The curve marked "level flight"
gives the forces for that condition with both air speed and throttle etting varing. In all cases
the force is a pull on the stick, or, in other words, the airplane is nose heavy. This nose heaviness
could be remedied, at least for any particular speed, or reduced to any desired extent by changing the stabilizer setting, or, what amounts to the same thing, by rigging the wings at a larger
angle of incidence. If the stick on either one of the machines u ed in the e tests is relea ed,
it will move forward from the equilibrium position and the machine will go into a dive "ith
the throttle wide open. Relea ing the stick during gliding de cent also throws the airplane
into a dive, the speed and steepne s of which rapidly increase, apparently without limit.
With free control , ju t a with the controls locked, stability i indicated by the slope of
a curve, but it is the curve of control forces in this ca e instead of that; of control po itions.
When the slope of the curve of forces is negative, as it i at low peeds in figures 28 and 29,
the machine is stable wilih free conkols, provided that the line of zero force on the stick
intersects the curve of forces, as any change of peed would et up moments which would cause
the elevators to move in the proper direction to restore the machine to its original attitude.
When, on the other hand, the slope is po itive the equilibrium is unstable and can only be
restored, once it is upset, by the intervention of the pilot. It is evident from the curves that
with free control , just as with the controls locked, the statical longitudinal stability is greatest
at low speed of flight, that the machine becomes un table at speeds in the neighborhood of the
maximum attainable, and that the stability is greater in gliding than with the throttle open.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS .

The ehief difference between statical stability with locked and free controls is that equilibrium
can be established at any speed in the former case by locking the controls in the proper position,
while there is only one possible speed of flight and angle of attack with free controls (for a
given weight of elevator). The stability with free controls is therefore sufficient if the curve
of forces cuts the line of zero force at one and only one point, the ~orce being negative at all
speeds higher than that corresponding to the point of equilibrium defined by the intersection
of this curve and axis, positive at all speeds lower. It therefore does not matter if there are
one or more" kinks," involving changes in the sign of the slope, in the force curve, provided
only that they do not reach or cross the axis. For completely satisfactory stability with
locked controls, however, the slope of the curve must be positive at every point throughout
the range of speeds likely to be reached.
As has been pointed out, the machines used in these tests were nose heavy under practically all conditions, but this can easily be corrected, if desired, by setting the stabilizer at a
larger negative angle relative to the wings. If greater stability or stability over a wider range
of speeds is required it can be secured by moving the center of gravity forward, just as in the
case of fixed controls. The natural tendency, when a machine is nose heavy, is to seek to
cure it by moving the center of gravity farther back. Where, howe\'"er, as in this case, the
nose heaviness is accompanied by instability, moving the C. G. aft will only serve to aggravate
the latter difficulty. If the C. G. is moved at all it should be moved forward . Changing the
stabilizer setting so as to gi\'"e an increased downward force on the tail, on the other hand,
improves the balance and, as will be shown later, also has SOme beneficial effect on the stability
with free controls. The exact effect of changing the stabilizer setting is difficult to predict
unless an exhaustive series of tests on pressure distribution over the elevator is available (such
tests have never been made except for one machine), as the moment about the elevator hinge
depends largely on the position of the center of pressure on the elevator, and this is a very
uncertain quantity. If the center of pressure position is assumed to be unaffected by the
changes in elevator angle to secure equilihrium at a giyen speed with a changed stahilizer
setting, the alteration in moment about the hinge, due to the different stabilizer angle, is almost
exactly proportional to the square of the speed, as the change in elevator angle for equilibrium
is very nearly the same for all speeds. The slope of the cur\'"e of forces on the stick, under
these conditions, would decrease in nlgebraic value if the stabilizer angle were decreased, and
the tendency would be toward stability. From this the deduction can be drawn that stability
with free controls can not be obtained at any gi\'"en speed merely by changing the stabilizer
setting unless, the machine was originally nose heavy at the designated speed and all lower
speeds of flight. Furthermore, an airplane the curve for which is unstable (i. e., has a positive
slope)- throughout the range of normal speeds of flight can not be made stable with free controls
at any speed whatever by changing the stabilizer setting unless it is initially nose heavy at all
points of its speed range. Although the e deductions are based on an assumption not strictly
true they check well with experiment and furnish a fair basis for reasoning. It follows from
the foregoing conclusions that the maximum positive angle to which an adjustable stabilizer
can be moved should depend on the hehavior of the machine in a steep descent with the throttle
open. For stability, the force on the stick under those conditions should always be a push.
When it becomes a pull it i a sign that the stabilizer angle is too large.
If tho conditions laid down in the last paragraph are not observed it will, as ah·eady
noted, be impossible to secure stability with the stabilizer alone, and the centor of gravity
will have to be moved forward.
It will be noticed that the curves of control force for the two airplanes in gliding are
nearly identical, while the negative moment a.bout the hinge with throttle open are considerably largor for o. 1 than for No.3. This difference is at least partially due to the diITers
ence in the vertical coordinates oj the center of gravity, the C. G. of No.1 being higher than
that of o. 2 because of the reser,e tank in the uppor wing. The center of gravity being
farther above the tbru t line in o. 1, the thrust on that machine produces a stalling moment

about the C. G., and this has the e(J'ect of making the machine less nose heavy than it would
otherwise be.
It is desirable that the pilot of an airplane should be able to release the controls at any
time without causing the machine to go into a steep dive or to stall badly. In order to fulfill this
requirement the center of gravity should be materially farther forward with respect to the
wings than it was in the particular airplanes which were the subjects of the e tests, and the
stabilizer should be et at such an angle to the wings that the machine will be in equilibrium with
the controls free and the engino thrott.led at a speed well within its normal range (60 miles per
hour would be a good figure for an airplane of the type and performance of the JN4H). Exact.
recommendations as to the position of tho C. G. can not be made without further tests, but it is
probable that 28 per cent of the way back from the leading edge on the mean chord of the wings
will be found a satisfactory location. The negative angle of the stabilizer with 10 poct to the
wings should be larger in these ..nachines than in1,hose in which t.he stabilizer section is symmetrical about a horizontal plano: A stabilizor with a flat lower and a cambored upper surface,
such as that ont he JN4H, has its zero lift line at an angle of from 2° to 4 ° to it chord, and it is
the zero lift line which hould be considered in choosing tho setting.
In order to put to the test these theories as to the cause and cure of instability and poor balanre, airplane No . 1 was rerigged with Lhe stagger reduced by:3 inches, and with ,the rear of the
stabilizer blocked up so that its chord was at a negative angle of 1°.6 to the top longerons, or
4 ° to the 'wing. The reduction of tho stagger by mOving the upper wing backward has pract ically the sarno effect as has moving the ccnter of gravity forward.
m
Although the tests with this new arr:: gement have not as yet been carried far enough to make
it possible to plot a se~ of curves, it was very apparent tha t the nose hoavines of the machine was
much diminished and that the stability, both with free and fixed controls, was imprOved. The
machine was still unstable at high speeds, but much less so than before. It was dived to a speed
of
miles per bour with the throttle half closed, and the pull on the stick at this speed was
only 10 pounds. There was no difficulty in taking oIT or landing, and the performance of the
machine was not modified in any other respect. It is believod, as a result of these tests, that it
will be found possible by fUl,thor changes of tho same nature to secure complete statical stability
of the JN4H at all speeds without incurring any counterbalancing disadvantages.

Longitudinal balance of the De Haviland .

In order to have data on another airplane for purposes of comparison, and also to secure definite information on tho e.ITect of an adj us table stabilizer, the experiments which have been described above were repeated on the De Haviland 4 with Liberty engine. The method pursued in
the first series of tests on this machine was identical with that already described, and the curves
of control position, force, and moment for various throttle settings are given in figures 30 and 3l.
The force required at the top of the stick to balance the weight of the elevator was 3i pounds,
and a force of 1 ponnd on the stick corresponded to a moment of 24.6 pound-inches about the
elevator hinge. The" gearing" of the control was therefore practically identical with that in
the IN. The scale of abscissre may not be strictly accura~e, as the air-speed meter on this machine was never calibrated on the speed course, but it prohably would not be in error by more
than three or four milos an hour at any point.
It appears from these cun'es that the DH4 po'sesses statical longitudinal stability both wit,h
fixed controls and with free controls, and that the trimming speed for any given condition in-'
creases as the engine speed decreases. If, for example, the elevator is locked at +3° with the
throttle opon the machine will fly at 82 miles per hour, and will automatically return to that speed
if any disturbance causes a momentary deviation from it. If the engine is then throttled down
to the ielling condition,leaving the control stilllocIced at + 3°, the nose will drop and the steepness
of the flight path will increase until the speed of 114 miles per hour is attained. Tho airplane
will then continue to descend steaclily at this speed on a llight path of constant slope. There
will be no tendoney, as in the other airplanes which have been discussed, to dive more and
more steeply without limit.

Much the same statements can be applied to flight with fr e controls, except that in this
case there is only one trimming speed for a giv n stabilizer angle and throttle setting. Here,
again, the trimming speed increases as the throttle is closed.
It is obvious that the airplane of the future

preceding section of this report.
The trimming speed increases as the stabilizer angle increases, slowly at :first and then
very rapidly. A change of angle from -1 ° 30' to 0° only raises the trimming speed with free
controls from 71 to 86 miles per hour, but only about 0° 40 ' further change in angle is required
to increase the trimming speed from 86 to 120 miles per hour. Since so small a change of
angle has so large an effect it is necessary, in order to gain the full benefit of an adjustable stabilizer, that the adjustment be through a screw or other slow-motion device with a minimum
of backlash, so that the angle can be regulated with great exactn ess . The backlash on the
DH4 t ested was about 0° 15'.

The provision of an adjustabJ e stabilizer on the DH4, and th e range of angl es chosen for

SLIP-STREAM CORRECTIONS IN PERFORMANCE COMPUTATION.
By

EDWARD

P.

WARNER.

In computing the performance of an airplane, the values taken for the slip-stream correction
have a very marked effect on the results, both as regards the speed required for flight at a given
angle of attack and as regards the horsepower required, and a mishLke in estimating. the magnitude of the corr,ection factor may cause considerable errors in the preliminary estimate of performance attainable. Notwithstanding the importance of the slip-stream effect relatively
little study has been devoted to it and the proper way of treating it still remains largelY .uncertain. This lack of knowledge as to the magnitude of the correction and its effects is amply
attested by the wide variation among the methods employed by designers engaged in the
making of performance computations. Some have ignored the correction entirely. Others,
seeking a slightly greater accuracy but not desiring to embnrk on too laborious a set of computations, have made an over-all allowance, increasing the total resistance of the machine
(including both parasite resistance and wing drag) by 10 per cent or 15 per cent. Such a
device is frequently employed when performance is to be computed dire.c tly from a wiudtunnel test on a model of the complete machine, and when only the total resistance is known,
no data on the resistance contributed by different parts of the structure being available. As the
proportion of the total resistance which lies in the slip stream varies widely betweell different
types of machines, this method can manifestly lead to nothing more than a very rough approximation. The next step, to further increase the exactness of the performance computations, is
to consider the reSIstance broken up into two parts; that due to members inside and that due to
members outside the slip stream, and to treat these two parts as having different relative air
speeds. The speed used in computing the resistance of the parts outside the slip stream area
is equal to the air speed of the machine; that used for the parts inside the slip-stream is somewhat higher. The amount of the difference between the two has been much in dispute, but the
corrections generally applied range from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. That is to say, the velocity
is considered to be from 10 per cent to 20 per cent greater inside than outside the slip stream,
and the resistance of an object in that area is therefore taken as from 21 per cent to 44 per cent
greater than the resistance of the same object would be if it were "removed from the zone I)f
influence of the propeller draft.
Whatever the value that may be taken for the correction factor, it is almost invariably
considered to remain constant at all speeds of flight, and it is in this assumption that the greatest
source of error lies. When the engino is kept running at full throttle, and all the reserve power
is used in causing the machine to climb, the air speed being relatively low, the ratio of slipstream velocity to velocity of advance will quite evidently be considerably higher than when the
flight path is horizontal, with a higher speed of advance or with a throttled engine. The exact
manner of the variation of slip-stream effect will be. taken up a little later.
We may attack the problem of the slip-stream correction in either of two ways, both of
which we shall discuss. In the first place, we may base our corrections on wind-tunnel tests
of propeller mQdels. Unfortunately, there is very little data available on the velocity of the
flow of the air behind a propeller under test. Secondly, we may depend on pure theory, determining the mean slip-stream velocity from energy considerations. While this is not strictly
valid, it affords an interesting means of obtaining data for comparison, and of extending the
experimen ta\ res.ul ts.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.

Measurements of slip-stream effect for model propellers have been made by Eiffel, at his
laboratory ne~r Paris, and by Riabouchinsky nt Koutchino. Eiffel"s results are the more
valuable, as the propeller used during the tests was more nearly like those used on aircraft at
the present time than were the models employed at Koutchino.
It should be noted that all these experiments deal with propellers tested with no other
objects in their neighborhood, and that the results might be materially modified by the mutual
interference of the propeller and the other parts of the machine. This is particularly true of
the body, inasmuch a it is very close to the propeller and 1s immediately behind the least
efficient portion of that member, so that it ha somewhat the snme effect of stream-lining the
hub and guiding the air across the more eirective portions of the blade as has a spinner in front.
The effect of the body on the propeller would then be such as to neutralize, at least in part, the
increase of body resistance caused by the slip-stream. This effect would apply primarily to the
body, the resistance of which, if it is well designed, is a relatively small part of the total parasite
resistance in the slip-stream. The eirect of the struts, tail surfaces, and other members on the
action of the propeller would probably be so small as to be negligible, thanks to their di tance
behind the propeller and to the fact that they lie behind the effective portion of the bladE's
rather than directly behind the hub.
The ratio of slip-stream velocity to velocity of advance, like every other factor or propeller
performance, i , for geometrically similar propcllers, a function of the non dimensional ratio
VI Nfl.
ince it is necessary to apply to widely different propellers the data obtained by tests
of two or three special cases we must seek some means of compari on, and this means is provided
by the provisional assumption that the raLio of slip-stream velocity to flight velocity at the
speed of maximum propeller efficiency is the same for all propellers. We may then consider
the slip-stream efYect to depend on the ratio of V/ND to (V/ND)/, or, for a given propeller
diame tel" and engine speed, on V/ V', where V is the actual speed of flight and V' the speed for
maximum propeller efficiency at the sume number of revolutions per minute. This is the only
method open to us if we rely o]ely on experimental data, but we shall sec later that the use of the
momentum theory makes it possible to actually compute the slip-stream effect for a given
propeller, and that the magnitude of this effect varies somewhat with blade form, blade width,
number of blades, pitch-diameter ratio, etc.
Eiffel's experiments 1 were performed on his propeller 0.9, which has quite a normal blade
form , with straight trailing edge and leading edge 0 curved a to give a maximum blade width
approximat ly three-quarters of the way out from hub to tip. The pitch at all points was 0.7 of
the diameter, and the maximum efficiency (75 per cent) was secured when VI ND was equal to
0.6, corre ponding to a speed of flight of roughly 105 mil s per hour with a Liberty engine turning
1,700 revolutions per minute and a two-bladed propeller 9 fcet in diameter. The ratio of
efl'ective pitch to diameter for b st efficiency therefore was not very far from current practice.
The air velocity in the slip-stream wa determined by pitot tube measurements at five
points, placed at 0:4,0.6, O. ,0.96, and 1.1 times the radius from hub to tip. That is, the last
point was actually slightly outside of the propeller disk area. To determine the extent to which
the air spreads out and the added velocity disappears as the distance from the propeller is
increased, three such sets of points were tried, the first being only 0.04 of the propeller diameter
behind the plane of the trailing edges of the propeller blades, the second being located 0.2 of the
diameter behind that plane, and the third heing separated from the propeller by a distance equal
to its diameter.
The conclusions to be drawn directly from the result of these tests may be tabulated briefly
as follows:
(a) The slip-stream velocity is a maximum at a radius of about 0.6 of the distance from
hub to tip.

Although the above assumption as to slip-stream diameter may be accepted as registering
sufficiently closely with experimental results, it can be shown theoretically that the diameter
of the stream should vary with slip ratio, or, for a given engine speed and propeller diameter,
with the speed of flight. R. E. Froude has shown that the increase in velocity of the fluid
before it reaches the propeller should be exactly equal to the added velocity imparted after
passing through the propeller, or, using algebraic symbols, that VI - V = ~ (Vs - V), where V
is the speed of flight, VI the indraught velocity, and Vs the slip-stream velocity. Since the
same mass of fluid passes evcry point along the stream in a unit of time, the prociuct of
velocity and stream area must be the same at all points if compressibility of the fluid be neglected. We shall then have, assuming the cross-section area of the inflowing current to be
equal to the area swept by the propeller:

~-V

This ratio would vary from a minimum value of 0.71, under stntic conditions, to a maximum
of 1.0 at the speed where Vs = V and there is no thrust. As neither of these conditions is ever
approached in

norma~ flight,

we can safely say that the theoretical value of

~., will not wander

far from the one (0 .9) to which we have already been led by empirical data.
The most striking thing about the curves of figure 1 is the remarkable degree of constancy
of Vs/ V'. It appears that, so long as the engine speed is kept constant, the slip-stream velocity
is almost independent of the speed of flight, except at speeds well above that of maximum
efficiency.
Since V8 is so nearly constant, it is evident that Vs/ V will increase rapidly as V decreases,
becoming infinite when the machine is being held stationary on the ground with the engine
running, prior to the starting of a flight. The method, which I have already mentioned, of
computing performance by a suming Vs! V to have a constant value of 1.15 or 1.2 is therefore
manifestly quite incorrect except for a single speed somewhere in the neighborhood of the
speed of maximum propeller efficiency. To determine the correction factor for any other speed
we must have recourse to slip-stream velocity curves similar to those of figure 1. The error
introdueed by the assumption of a constant correction factor will obviously be most important
at the low and moderate speeds which correspond to most efficient climb, and undoubtedly
accounts for the difficulty which has u ually been experienced in computing rate of climb.
It is well known that, although the maxinmm horizontal speed of a new machine can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy from performance computations of the ordinary type
or from a wind-tunnel test of a model, an attempt to predict climbing speed in a similar fashion
very commonly gives a value distinctly higher than that found in a free-flight test of the
completed machine.
EFFECT OF SLIP-STREAM ON PERFORMANCE.

The method of applying the slip-stream correction to the parasite resistance of the parts
inside the slip-stream area to secure the corrected total resistance and the horsepower required
for flight is simple and obvious, differing in no essential particular from that employed when
the correction factor is assumed to remain constant.
We have been considering so far a case in which the engine speed is assumed to remain
constant at all speeds of flight, a case which is never exactly realized. If the throttle be kept
open, the load on the engine will be greatest, and the revolutions per minute will consequently

SLIP-STREAM CORHECTIONS IN PERFORMANCE COMPUTATION .

607

be lowest, when the slip percentage is greate t; or, in other words, when the speed of flight is
lowest, and the engine speed with open throttle may be 5 per cent or more lower when the
plane is climbing at an angle of attack of about 8° than when it is flying level at an angle of
attack in the neighborhood of _1 °. The variation of revolutions per minute is small, however, and we shall not go far astray if we stick to our original assumption that the engine speed
remains constant so long as the throttle is wide open. We have now to consider the effects of
partially throttling the engine, and the modifications of slip-stream effect which are involved.
When the throttle is partially closed the engine speed is reduced and the value of VI ND, the
propeJIer slip function, is therefore increased. It is evident from Fig. 1 that an increase in
VI ND causes a decrease in the ratio of Vs to V. If the engine be throttled to half its original
number of revolutions, for example, maintaining the same speed of flight and varying the slore
of the flight-path, the value of ( VI ND )/ (V/ND )' will be doubled and the ratio of Vs to V will
be reduced, for a machine flying at 40 per cent of the speed for which the propeller was designed,
from about 2.6 to 1.4. The parasite resistance of parts in the slip- tream would then be
reduced by 71 per cent by throttling the engine, although the speed of flight would remain
the same. This, of course, is an extreme case, as the engine speed in level flight would seldom
drop to less than 75 per cent of the rated speed. If the plane is gliding with the engine cut
off, the slip-stream effect'will of course disappear entirely.
It is of interest now to examine the variation of the slip function and of the slip-stream
correction when the machine flies at different speeds in the neighborhood of the maximum
attainable, the engine always being throttled just sufficiently to keep the flight-path horizontal.
When the plane is flying at high speed the angle of attack is small and the coefficient of wing
drag is near its minimum value. This coefficient Dc will therefore remain almost constant if
the angle is varied slightly, and the total wing drag will be very nearly proportional to the
square of the speed for mall changes in speed in the neighborhood of the maximum attainable.
The parasite resistance is always proportional to the square of the speed, neglecting the small
effect of inclination of the body, struts, etc., and the total resistance will therefore be proportional to the square, and the horsepower required to the cube, of the speed of flight, provided
that the slip-stream correction factor remains constant. This relation, it must be remembered, holds only in the neighborhood of the maximum speed of flight (say for angles of attack
between - 2° and + 3°) . It can be shown that, if we assume the validity of the blade element
theory of propeller design, the power absorbed by a given propeller is proportional to V3 if
the slip function be kept constant. Since the horsepower absorbed must vary as V in order
that it may be equal to the horsepower required for level flight, it is evident that the slip
function will be approximately constant so long as the machine flies in a horizontal path at an
angle close to that of minimum drag. To take a concrete illustration, if the speed of flight be
decreased 10 per cent the maximum power required for flight will decrease to (.9)3, or 73 per
cent of the original value. In order that the slip function may remain constant the engine speed
must be decreased by 10 per cent. Since the value of VI ND is unchanged, the ratio of slipstream velocity to speed of flight will also remain unchanged, so long as the flight-path is
horizontal and the speed is fairly high. At very low speeds the slip-stream correction factor
in horizontal flight is larger than at those in the neighborhood of the maximum, as the revolutions per minute decrease less rapidly than the flight speed, and the slip function consequently
decreases at low speeds.
DEDUCTIONS FROM THE MOMENTUM THEORY OF PROPULSION.

Our deductions to date have aU been based, owing to an unfortunate paucity of experimental data, on a single set of tests in which only one propeller was used. It is now of interest
to ·examine the question from another point of view, and see what we can learn by the application of pure theory.
The Rankine-Froude theory of fluid propulsion is based on the assumption that the thrust
given by a propeller is equal to the sternward momentum imparted to the fluid in unit time.

608

If we assume the correctness of this theory, and further assume, as we have already done, that
the slip-stream has a diameter equal to 0.9 of the propeller diameter and that the velocity of
the air is uniform aU over the slip-stream, we can readily compute the slip-stream velocity,
given the engine horsepower, propeller efficiency, propeller diameter, and speed of flight.

It is evident that any change in propeller design, such as an increase in the number of

It is of considerable interest to compare the slip-stream correction obtained ,by thi theoretical analysis with that found by actual measurement of the air velocities behind a prop tiller.
This has been done for Eifrel's propeller No.9, the experimental data for which we have already

The coincidence between the two curves in figure 2 is quite extraordinary, especially in the

The variation III V.I V is greater t.han, might have been expecteel, Eiffel's 27 propellers,
showing values ranging from 1.065 tu 1.439. Just. above half of the models tested have values
between 1.15 and] .35, and we call safely say that these will be the limiting values for t.wo-bladed
propellers of normal t.ype and pitch. In the case of tbe Durund propellers, Vsl V lay between
1.15 and 1.35 for all except 2 of the 18 examined.
Tho figures obtnined above lead to certain general copclusions as to the dependence of the
slip-stream effect on the ty pe of propeller employed. It appears that Vsl V depends primarily
on pitch, being high for those propellers in whieh the piteh-rliamoter ratio i least. Eiffel's
No.1, for examplo, which shows a very high Fal V, had a pitch of only ahout one-half the diameter, wherel:l.s No. 20, for which Val F was only 1.065, had a pitch of ].4 times the diameter. It
app ears, furthermore, and mther surprisingly, that. the slip-stream effect is substantially independent of blade width and blade form, the propellers with blades of constant width showing,
on the whole, a sligntly higher TIs! V than t.hose with more rounded bIn-de tips.
The nsc of a cambered face on tho blades increases Vsl v. Durand Nos. 5 and 29, for exam ple,
are exu.ctly alike except that the former has a flat , the latter a camhered, blade face, and No .
29 gives a considerably bighor slip-stream velocity than does No.5. The most pronounced
effect, however, comes from varying the number of bladr.s. Eiffel's T os. 1.5 and 16 are exactly
similar except that the former hus two blades, the latter four (Nos. 17 and 18 are also fourbladed), yet the first gives a velocit.y ratio of 1.22, the second of 1.37. It is customary, in
using the Dr7.ewiecki, or blade element, theory of propeller design, to assume that two narrow
blades are exactly the same as ono wide ono, but analysis of experiments makes it appear that
that assumption is far from the truth, and that a given blade area will absorb more power
when it is subdivided among several blades than when it :'s concentrat.ed in two.

DESCRIPTION A D DISCUSSION OF THE BALANCE FOR THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE'S WIND
TUNNEL AT LANGLEY FIELD.

In designing a bAlance for the Langley Field wind ttmnel, after careful consideration and
analysis of the variou types which have been used at other laboratories, as well as of several
arrangements not hitherto tried which were suggested, it was decided to adhere in general to
the type of l;>alance which has been u ed, sub tantially without .change, for a number of years
by the National Physical Laboratory. There is no other so simple to use, yet the accuracy
attainable is as great as with any of the. more complicated types. The design was modified in
some respects to permit of the measurement of larger forces than those for which the original
N. P. L . balances are suited, as well as to introduce certain changes which seemed likely to improve the convenience or accuracy of the work. In the description which follows particular
attention will be paid to the details in which the balance differs from its prototype, very full
descriptions of the latter having been printed in many places. 1 For the benefit of those who
are not familiar with the N. P. L. balance it may be briefly explained that its distinguishing
feature is the carrying of the whole balance on a single pivot, thus permitting it to rock in two
planes. The model is mounted above the pivot with its Y axis vertical (i. e., "standing on the
wing tip") and the lift and drag are measured simultaneously by hanging weights on two arms
at right angles to each other and balancing the apparatus up in two plane at once. The leverage ratio in this balance, as in those in the N. P. L. 4-foot tunnels, is one-half, the distance from
the main pivot to the center of the model being 137 cm. (54 inches), while that from the pivot
to the scale-pan sockets at the ends of the weighing arms is 68.5 cm. (27 inches).
Assemblies and sections of the balance are given in Plates I- IV, and photographs of the
completed instrument in Figs. 1 and 2. Figs. 3 to 10, inclusive, illus trato all the parts (e -cepL
about 10 specially made parts and such stock hardware as machine screws and nuts) ontering
into the construction of the balance. Each part is numbered in these illustrations, and fr0quent reference will be made to them in discussing the working of various elements.
RIGID PARTS.

The frame is essentially the same as in the original N. P. L. balance, except that it is cast
in one piece instead of having the head which carries the moving part of the instrument cast
eparate and bolted on. Furthermore, where the British design has only one member projecting
from the frame head the Langley Field balance has till:ee, one passing into the movable portion
of the balance and carrying the socket for the main pivot, the other two passing around the outside of the movable portion and a little more than half encircling it. A cast-iron yoke is bolted
to the ends of these encircling members, and the balance proper is then entirely surrounded hy
a ring, with just enough clearance to permit it to rock without danger of striking the frame.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The object of thus encircling the balance with the frame WI1S to provide a point of attachment for the guide arms. In the . P. L. instrument they pass through holes cut in the ide
of the moving portion and are bolted directly to the single frame lug which carries the main
pivot ocket.
ince the Langley Field balance was designed to carry load up to 20 kO". on the
model some stronger method of attachment for the guide arms was required, as well a one
which would permit of easier assembling and dismounting.
The guide arms are made of teel tube, 25.4 rom. (1 inch) in out ide diameter and with
5-mm. walls. They are pinned into sockets at the end, and these sockets are bolted directly to
the frame or (in the case of the lift arm) to the yoke which connects to the frame p.nd pa se
around the balance. The worst stl.'ess in the guide arms occurs when there i no weight on the
weighing arms and the load on the model is at a maximum or when the wind i nddenly stopped
with the weight in the cale-pan adjusted to balance a large load. With a load of 20 kg. acting
on tbe model the force applied at the end of the guide arm is 40 kg., and the bending tress at the
root of the arm is 1,475 kg. per square centimeter (21,000 pounds per square inch). The guide
arms carry cages which slide in dovetailed slots and Cl1n be adjusted by screws through a vertical
range of about 6 mm. in order to facilitate the preliminary lining up of the instrument with the
lower pivot engaged. Instead of using a thread or wire as a reference line a piece of gla s with
a hair line scribed on it is mounted in the side of each cage. The weighing arms are nickel
plated, and the reference line carried by the cage is lined up with its own reflection in the weighing arm and with a similar line scribed on that arm, thus avoiding any po' ibility of parallax
due to the considerable distance between the two arms.
The dashpot is nearly identical with that on the N. P. L. instrument. It ,m cast with two
pas ages, connecting opposite pairs of chambers, cored in the bottom, and a petcock communicates with each of those cored passage. This insnre that the damping liquid will always tand
at the I1me level in oppo ite chambers, but it is still possible to have it at different levels in
adjacent chambers or to use liquids of different vico ities if it i de ired to damp the 0 cillations
in one plane more powerfully than those in the other.
BRAKE AND LOWER PIVOT SOCKET.

The hrake, a hart distance above the dashpot, is of a different type from that used by the
N. P. L.' a it was necessary to secure a very powerful grip, capable of resisting a large
torsional moment, on the lower tube, but without risking crushing that thin-walled tube. The
brake u ed i identical in principle with a lathe collet and give a uniform pre sure over virtually
the entire circumference of the tube.
A mechanism for raising and lowering the lower pivot socket, causing engagement or release
of the pivot, is mounted underneath the dashpot. The parts are illustrated and numbered in
fig. 6. The handle 1 i fastened to the cam 4 and the rotation of this handle through a quarter
turn rai e the cam 3 by 10 rom. The adju ting crew 5 is crewed into 3 and transmits the
vertical movement to the pivot ocket 7 through the sleeve 6 and the spring ; 7 rises freely
until it comes in contact with the lower pivot, and thereafter, as 3 and the attached parts
continue to rise,
is compre ed, increasing the pre sure between the pivot and it ocleet.
When 3 ha been rai ed to its maximum height the pressure between the pivot and socket
can be adju ted by turning the crew 5 in the cam 3, two turn of the screw being sufficient to
change the pres ure from 0 to 20 kg. The spring 9, much weaker than ,i used to a i t gravity
in throwing the socket out of engagement after the cam ha been lowered. Thi device is very
much quicker and ea ier to operate than the usual simple screw and spring, and it has the great
advantage of permitting an adjustment of pre nre for different lateral force of the pivoti again t
its socket and for dillerent total weights to be carried. The load can thus be eli tributed between
the upper and lower pivot. in any manner de ired.

OF BALANCE.

In order to reduce the weight of the main pivot, the upper and lower parts of the balance
were both cast of aluminum alloy instead of bronze, as has been the practice hitherto. Since
an aluminum to aluminum bearing at the point where the pieces touch would be undesirable, a
steel plate is screwed to the lower face of the upper part. This plate has teeth cut around its
periphery, and these mesh with the teeth on the pinion whose case is mounted on the clamping
ring (to be described later). By rotating the pinion lmob the upper part of the balance is turned
with reference t.o the lower part and the angle of incidence can thus be adjusted very accurately.
The main balance casting were proportioned for tifl'ness and for reasonable ease of construction, rather than from the standpoint of ske s. The maximum bending stre s in the lower
head is 29 kg. per square centimeter, giving a factor of safety of about 40, and that in the upper
head is quite as large.
The force acting on the balance, and tending to separate the upper and lower heads on one
ide while forcing them together on the other, is too great to permit the use of the T-slot
arrangement employed by the N. P. L., and the two pieces were therefore clamped together by
an alloy- teel ring threaded onto the lower part and with a flange turned inward and bearing
against the upper portion. This ring is one of the few parts of the balance which is probably
materially stronger and heavier than it needs to be. The stress in such a flange is difficult to
compute \vith ' accuracy because of uncertainty as to the distribution of the pressure between
the surfaces, but it is estimated on the best assumptions available, as 700 kg. per square centimeter (10,000 pounds per square inch), giving a factor of safety of over 10. It would be safe to
reduce the maximum thiclmess of the clamping ring and its flange to 3 mm. (three-sixteenths
inch), and the weight could thus be reduced by about 500 gms.
The clamping ring covers up the portion of the upper head which normally bears the graduated circle, and the graduations have therefore been transfered to the horizontal portion of
that head, just inside the inner edge of the clamping ring flange. Since this is too high from the
floor to be convenient for direct observation, a prism is mounted on the clamping ring so that
the graduations can be read with the eye on a level with the plane dividing the two parts of the
balance. A movable vernier is mounted at the same point and its graduations are also reflected
in the prism.
The weighing-arms, instead of being cantilevers, as in previous balances of this type, are
tru ed with tie-rods. The arms are made of steel tube 25.4 rom. (1 inch) in diameter, with
walls 1.5 mm. (0.06 inch) thick, and are trussed with rods 4.5 rom. in diameter, making an angle
of 12°.5 with the arms themselves. The compressive tress in the arms under the maximum
load i 159 kg. per square centimeter (2,260 pounds per square inch) and the tensile stress in
the tie-rods i~ 943 kg. per square centimeter (13,400 pounds per square inch). In order to carry
the same load with solid arms acting a cantilevers they ,,"ould have to be 24 mm. in diameter,
or approximately the same as the outside diameter of the thin-walled tubes now used. The
deilection with cantilever arms would be much greater than with trussed, and the weight ,,-ould
be at least twice as great as the weight of the present arrangement.
Counterweights are provided for lift and drag. The lift counterweight i made fiat on top
so that more weight can be easily attached there when large negative lifts have to be measured,
by removing part of the weight placed in the scalepan to balance the counten,eight. Since
negative drags never occur, the arne necessity of adding weight does not arise for the drag
eoun terweigh t.
The main pivot is carried in a ribbed plate cast of aluminum aUoy and fL"'md inside the lower
part of the balance. This plate carries, in addition to the main pivot, two pivots and two
knife-edges, arranged around the circumference of a circle. All five pivots and knife-edges
lie on the same level. The balance frame carries, in addition to the main pivot socket, a pivot
socket and a knife-edge socket in line with the lift arm and a little lower than the main socket.
When it is desired to measure drag alone the main pivot is lowered with a special wrench inserted through a slot cut in the slide of the balance, and the balance is dropped until one of the

econdary pivots and one of the knife-edge mentioned above come into contact with their sockets, ju t a in the original N. P. L. instrument. The balance then has only 1 degree of freedom
and the lift arm can be disregarded entirely unle s the lift is very large, in which case enough
weight hould be hmlg on the. lift arm to balance the lift approximately (within 1 or 2 kg.) .
If thi i not dOlle the weight of the balance may be insufficient to hold it down, and the pivot
may 1'i e from its _ocket entirely. The other pivot and knife-edge are u ed to mea ure lift alone.

for mea uring drag alone. \'\hen it i de ired to measure lift alone, the screw upporting the

be spared to reduce it. It i very desirable that the wing be supported by the tip, a the interference of a center upport is much greater. With a pindle attached at the wing-tip, the
whole force on the model act at a large moment arm to produce bending stre in the 'spindlc.
With a ,,-ing 60 by 10 cm. and a force of 20 kg., a ' pindle of mild steel has to be at lea t 16 mm.
in diameter at the point of attachment to the wing to gi,e a factor of safety of 4. With a pindie of high-grade heat-treated alloy steel thi diameter can be reduced to 12 mm. For uniform
tres ,the pindle diameter at the trumpet top would be only 21 per cent greater than that at
Lhe .wing, but it is \yell to taper a little more abruptly than this in order to ecme increa eel
stiffness. When the parasite re i tance of bodie, airship hulls, or other streamline form i
heing determined a very much smaller pindle can be used than when wing~ are being te ted.
With an airship hull of low re i tance coefficient, the model being 12 cm. in diameter and being
te ted at a speed of 50 meter per second, the spindle diameter at the point of attachmen t need
be only 1.9 mm. in cliam tel', taperinO' to 2. mm. at a distance of ] 5 mm. Here again a harper
taper would be advisable to reduce the deflection and ayoid yibmtion of the model. In any

moment is large it is therefOl"e necessary to add dead weight to the weighing beam to hold it
down. A counterweight is placed oppo ite the scalepan on which the weights to balance the
moment arc hung, and this counterweight is heavy enough and placed far enough from the axis
of rotation of the beam so that the zero weight which must be placed in the scalepan to balance
Lhe beam with no wind on is greater than the largest diving moment which is likely to be measured. Both stalling and diving moments can thus be measured with a single scalepan.
The pring clamp u ed for transmitting the moment to the weighing beam i made with a
single helical pring behind one pivot. Th prc ure of this spring can be adjust d by tmning the
knurled head of the clamp. A C-spring of the type used on earlier N. P. L. balances could
not be made to give the requisite pressure and still be kept within reasonable limit of size.
The strut which opposes the spring clamp is made of a steel tube, 3 nun. oulside diameter,
1.5 rom. inside diameter, with hardened points mounted in its ends.
A separate dashpot is provided for damping the oscillations of the moment weighing arm .
The clamping:fin is carried at the lower end of a rod which runs down through a lot in the table
top of the balance frame.
When lift and drag are to be measmed the moment beam is locked, in order to prevent
rotation of the balance about a vertical axis, by passing a pin through holes drilled in the side
of the moment guide arm and in the weighing arm itself. The balance can be adjusted for alignment of the arms with the wind by moving the socket which is set in the lift counterweight
arm and which is provided with a screw adjustment.
MICROSCOPE FOR ALIGNMENT.

In order to check the alignment of the arms with the wind, a microscope i mounted on
t.he table top of the balance frame, and a reference line is carried on the balance itself, exactly
as in the Ol"iginal instrument except for mechanical details. The reference line is made adjustable with a micrometer screw in order that it may be brought inte line with the cross hair
of the microscope when the alignment is first determined or whenever it is checked. The reference line, once located, is left :f:L'md, and the two lines are thereafter brought into alignment,
whenever they get out from any cause, by moving the trut-and-spring clamp socket as described in the last section. Ordinarily the lines should come into register whenever the locking
pin is pas ed through the moment weighing arm without any adjustment.
VERTICAL FORCE ARM.

When lateral stability or control is to be investigated, requiring the measurement of six
forces and moments instead of three, the model is set up with the Y-au'ci horizpnto.l and the
lift is measured directly on the vertical force arm, which runs in the opposite direction from the
ill'ag arm. The method used in the Advisory Committee's balance is identical with that devised and used by the . P. L., and fully de cribed in the Report of the Briti h Advisory Committee for Aeronautics for 1912-13. Since the lift on a wind tunnel model at high speeds is
greater than the weight of the model, enough weights are strung on the vertical rod which
passes inside the balance to insure that the total weight on the inner end of the V. F. weighing
arm will be greater than the maximum lift.
CONCLUSION.

While it is perhap unwise to attempt to set a limit to future progress in any direction, it
.i not believed that the . P. L. type of balance will prove applicable to tunnel sizes and wind
speeds very much in excess of those at present realized. The load becomes too great for a
ingle pivot, the errors due to deflection rap'idly run up with the size of balance, and the handling of the weights becomes an arduous task with growing forces on the model. Even in the
present balance 40 kg. must be lifted onto the scalepan to balance the maximum lift. If there
i to be much further increase in the values of LV reached in model experiments, that increase
probably mu. t be accompanied by the adoption of a new type of weighing instrument.

SENSITIVITY OF WIND TUNNEL BALANCES OF THE N. P. L. TYPE.
The balances used in aerodynamic measurements, whatever may be their type, work
under conditions radically different from those to which practically all other weighing machines are exposed in that the load acting on the balance is never steady, but varies with the
greatest rapidity. In a chemical balance the action of gravity on the weights and on the substance to be -weighed is absolutely unchanging, assuming an absence of chcmical or physical
action with the surrounding air, and the only variable forces are those due to the currents of
air striking the balance. In a good balance even these are guarded against by the melosure
of the balance in a case, means being provided for manipulating the weights from outside.
When it is attempted to measure forces due to fluid velocity the whole problem of instrument design is much altered, for it becomes necessary to balance a fixed force, the pull of
gravity on the weights, against a variable one, the pressure on the object being tested. I t
was with the object of eliminating this dissymmetry that Lanchester devised, a number of
years ago, his aerodynamic balance in which the two forces balanced against each other varied
in the same way. In this instrument, used chiefly for finding the skin friction of plates, the
object to be tested was held at one end of a horizontal arm, the other end of which supported
a small flat plate so oriented as to be normal to the wind. The horizontal arm was free to rotate
about a vertical axis through its center. In use the apparatus was exppsed to a rapidly moving
current of air, and the area or position, or both, of the normal flat plate, were varied until the
arm showed no tendency to rotate. The moments about the axis were then equal and,
since the ,distance of each surface from the center of rotation could be measured and since the
resistance of normal flat plates had already been determined with a fair degree of accuracy
by other experimenters, using other methods, it was possible to solve for the unknown resistance. Once the arm on this instrument was balanced, it should show no tendency to rotate
due to changes in wind velocity, provided the velocity at any given instant was the same at
the two ends of the arm, as the 1'esistance of each object was very nearly proportional to the
square of the velocity, and the ratio of the resistances would be quite independent of wind
speed. For this same reason, indeed, measurements of the wind speed were wholly unnecessary for the determination of the coefficients. A device similar in conception was used by
Dines at about the same time for measuring resistances. In this case the surface tested was
carried on a whirling arm, and the resistance was balanced against the centrifugal force on a
weight connected to the surface through a bell crank. Here, again, no mea urement of speed
was required, as the resistance of tho object tested anJ. the centrifugal force on the weight were
both proportional to the square of the angular velocity of the whirling arm. An arrangement
for balancing the force on two surfaces against each other is also used in Mr. Orville Wright's
balance.
Such devices as these, however great their ingenuity, are inevitably unsatisfactory in some
re pects. In the fu'st type described, a preliminary determination of the resistance coefficient
for a flat plate normal to the wind was required, and the accuracy of all subsequent experiments was limited by the accuracy of this preliminary determination. No absolute measurements of resistance were possible. In both cases the mechanical complications introduced
by the shifting of a surface or of a bob weight were extreme.

mination of lift or drag. In thE;l case
of a wing, thi greatest accuracy i required in the measurement of the drag near those angles
where the drag coefficient is a minimum. The minimum drag of a wing 60 by 10 cm. at
a wind speed of 30 m. per second is about 72 g. In order that the error in the determination of this amount may not be over 1 per cent, the pos ible error in the preliminary run
with no wind on should under no conditions exceed ~ per cent of the quantity to be measured,
or, roughly, 0.35 g. In order that the measurement may be aCClU'ate to thi arp.ount it is
neces a1'Y to make the theoretical en itivity quite a little better than 0.35 g., as there)s
always some friction between a pivot and its socket, especially where, as in an instrument
of this type, the pivot mu t be somewhat blunted in order that it may carry its load without cru hing. In actual practice ,,-ith heavy pivot-supported aerodynamic balances, it is
found to be po sible to secure a di tinct movement of th~ drag arm due to changes of weight
of 0.05 g. The lift arm is omewhat les sensitive, as motions of this arm are oppo ed not only
by the friction between the pi"Vot and its ocket, but also by the friction between the lift counterweight arm and the two pivots (on the strut and spring clamp) which prevent rotation of the

body, is seldom required and seldom obtained. In general, if means be provided for adju ting
the balance to give a en itivity of 0.1 g., the result will be perfectly satisfactory.
The forces acting on the balance with no wind blowing are shown diagrammatically in figure
10. G is the combined center of gravity of the moving portions of the balance, the model, and
the weights required to balance the unsymmetrically disposed portions of the model and of
the instrument itself and is located at a distance X 0 below the pivot. These weights
are, of course, considered as applied at the point where the scalepan pivot touches
its socket in the weighing arm. W is the sum of all these weights (balance, model,
etc.). If a force .6.w be applied at the point A or, what amounts to the same thing,
if the weight on the scalepan be decreased by k.6.w where 7c is the multiplication ratio between the
vertical and the horizontal arms of the balance, the balance will, neglecting friction, rotate
about the pivot through an angle whose circular measure is equal to hW.6.w . The vertical moveXo

secured by modifying anyone of four terms (it is assumed that € can not be further decreased
except by the use of a microscope for observing the movements of the reference line). W is
always reduced to as Iowa value as possible if for no other reason than to keep down the load on
the pivot, but there are well defined limits beyond which this reduction can not proceed without
acrificing the strength and stiffness of the instrument to an extent which will introduce large
errors.
It would appear from the formula that f:,w could be reduced by increasing h or l, or both,
but this is not actually the case, since any increase in these quantities requires more than a
proportionate increase in weight in order to keep the deflection of the structure within safe
limits. h is always made as small as possible without bringing the enlarged sections of the
balance head close enough to the edge of the wind stream to interfere with the flow of air. lis
made as short as has been found expedient (usually l = ~ h) as any shortening of l rapidly increases the amount of weight which must be handled and the load on the pivot. There remains,
among the several variables, only xo, and this can be reduced practically without limit. Here
again the conditions under which wind tunnel balances work are peculiar. Whereas, in the
ordinary scientific balance, it is necessary only to construct the beam and attached parts so
that their combined center of gravity will be very slightly below the knife-edge and then to
place the knife-edge sockets for the scalepans so that a straight line connecting them will pass
through the knife-edge supporting the beam, thus making the sensitivity independent of the
weight in the scale pans, in the case of the wind tunnel balance neither the total weight of the
rigidly assembled moving parts nor the position of their center of gravity ever remains fixed for
two consecutive tests (unless they be made on the same model under identical conditions) . In
the case of the Langley Field tunnel, for example, the weight of the model and of the spindle
which supports it may lie anywhere between 50 and 10,000 g. Since the center of gravity of
the model is about 140 cm. above the center of gravity of the rest of the balance, the effect of
changing from the lightest to the heaviest model is to raise the center of gravity of the whole
assembly by about 60 cm. Manifestly, if Xo was very small with the light model in place, it
would have a large negative value when the heavy one was substituted, and the balance would
be unstable. On the other hand, if Xo was adjusted for a small positive value with the heavy
model its magnitude would greatly increase on changing over to the light one, .6.w would therefore be augmented manyfold, and the sensitivity of the measurement would be much decreased
just when the highest possible degree of accuracy would be required; that is, with a small model
experiencing only small forces. It is therefore neces ary to provide some means of adjusting
the center of gravity when the weight of model is changed, and this is done by means of the
((sensitivity weights" calTied on the spindles just above the da h-pot (shown in the side view

in the general assembly drawings of the Advisory Committee's balance). When the weight of
the model is largo, a large amount of weight is placed on the spindles, about 70 cm. below the
pivot, thus counteracting the tendency of the heavy model to raise the center of gravity. Wben
there i no model in position a weight of about 00 g. is required on the spindles to balance the
capsizing tendency of the balance it elf, and an additional amount of about twice the weight
of the model is required to maintain stable equilibrium with the model in place.
In the particular ca e of the committee's balance W, in the formula for sensitivity, is 20,700
g., not including the model, the weight in the scalepan, or any sensitivity weights except those
required Lo balance the upsetting tendency of the balance itself. \\ith a model in position and
no wind on, the total weight supported on the pivot lies, in most cases, between 21,000 g. and
49,000 g.,' with an average value of about 2 ,000 g. h is 54 inches, or about 137 em., and Zis
27 inches, approximately 6 .5 cm. € may be taken as 0.2 mm. If the required sensitivity be
taken as 0.1 g., which was shown abo,e to be a fair average value, Xo must not be more than
1.7 cm. On tp.e other hand, Xo must not, under any conditions, be negative, as the balance " 'ill

corresponds to an angular rotation of 0.00029 radian, the product of the total weight and the
distance from the pivot to the center of gravity may vary, without falling below the minimum
permissible sensitivity, from 0 to 47,000 gm. cm. Since the sensitivity weights are located
about 70 cm. below the pivot a variation of nearly 00 g. in the amount of weight used is po sible
without changing the sensitivity beyond the assigned limits. A somewhat closer adjustmont
than this is actually sought for, as it is not desirable, as \vill be shown later, to have too much
sensitivity, but there is no nece sity for changing the weights by smaller intervals than 200 g.
Since the weight is always ymmetrically disposed on the two spindles the smallest weight used
i 100 g.
With the wind on the conditions are changed considerably. ~ill the forces which acted
during the preliminary run continue in operation, in addition to two new ones, thc resultant force
on the model due to the reaction of the moving air and the weight u ed to balan e this resultant.
(Lift and drag are here considered as a unit. Strictly speaking, of course, there are three forces
acting-the resultant force due to the air, the pull of gravity on the lift weights, and the pull
of gravity on the drag weights.) The moments of these two new forces about the balance pi.vot
must be equal i.n order that the system may continue in equilibrium.
The conditions of stability of the system are also modified. The addition of weight to the
scalepans has no effect, provided that the socket for the scalepan pivot is, as it should be, exactly
in the horizontal plane through the main pivot when the balance is in equilibrium. Since there
is inevitably some deflection of the weighing arms, no mattor how well they may be braced, this
condition can not be exactly obtained under all loads, but the deviation from the ideal is small.
The magnitude of this deflection al1d the errors arising from it· are examined in another part of
the paper.
If the line of action of the force on the model intersect the vertical line through the pivot
the change in moment arm due to small inclinations of the balance is negligible, and the
moment of the force about the pivot remains substantially constant during the oscillations of the balance, so long as the force itself is not varied by fluctuations in the wind
velocity or any other cause. If, however, the force does not act through a point vertically over the pivot the two forces supposed to be in equilibrium (that due to tho
pressure of the air on the model and that due to the pull of gravity on the added weights)
will not continue in equilibrium when the balance inclines, and loss of sensitivity or
loss of stability of the system will result, just as is the case when, in an ordinary
physical balance, the line connecting the points of suspension of the scalepans passes below' or
above the knife-edges. It is rather difficult to defino satisfactorily the point which, being analogous to the point of suspension of a scalepan, should be located directly above the pivot. For
the present, at least, it will be simplest to consider separately the ofl'ects of each of the six forces
and moments acting on an object, not necessarily symmetrical, exposed to a current of air.

WIND TUNNEL BALANCES.

623

Instead of consjdering the lift and drag, acting perpendicular and parallel to the relative wind,
as is the ordinary practice in wind tunnel work, it will be best to deal with the forces resolved
parallel to axes fixed in the model, in accordance with the current practice in stability work.
In this way the moment arm of each force about the pivot will be iL'l:.ed, whatever oscillatons
the balance may undergo. The three forces are taken as acting at an origin which may be arbitrarily fixed, but which is almost always located at the center of gravity in the case of a model
of a complete airplane and at the center of the leading edge in the case of an aerofoil.
Oscillations of the lift arm of the balance can obviously have no effect on the sensitivity.
There only result is to incline the plane of the wings out of the vertical. This does not change
the magnitudes of any of the forces along axes fixed in the model, nor of the moments about
such axes, and, since the moment arms are constant, as pointed out above, the moments them.
selves will not change.
Oscillations of the drag arm, however, yaw the model instead of rolling it. As soon as the
model yaws symmetry is destroyed and all of the forces and moments may be modified in some
degree. The variation of the pitching moment are of no ~nterest in the present connection,
as the moment is exerted about a vertical axis, and can not possibly affect the equilibrium of the
balance. Its only effect on the sensitivity is to change the pressure of the short balance arm
against the strut which prevents the balance from rotating about a vertical axis, and so to
change the friction at this point. Of the five quantities remaining, the variations in the forces
Z and X, closely analogous to the lift and drag, are small, but not so small as to be negligible.
In general, Z decreases slightly with small deviations from the position of symmetry,
while X increases, but exceptions to both of these rules are sometimes encountered.
The rate of decrease of Z is usually about one-half of 1 per cent for each degree of yaw.
The change in X usually ranges from t per cent to It per cent increase for each degree of
yaw. Since the oscillations of the two arms of the balance are usually synchronous,
both being governed by the variations in wind velocity, the effect of the movements
of the drag arm, causing the model to take up an angle of yaw, on the lift must not be
neglected. Since for a model of an airplane or other symmetrical object, the direction of
change of X and Z is the same for a positive as for a negative angle of yaw, the effect of the
changes is to assist a return to the position of equilibrium when the deviation is in one direction
from that position and to oppose it when the deviation is in the other direction. If the initial
sensitivity (with no wind on) is very great there is danger that this added moment opposing a
return to equilibrium may be large enough to overcome the righting moment due to the weight
of the balance. The result of this will be somewhat the same as the result of using insufficient
counterweight to balance a, heavy model, but the instability in this case will appear only for
motions in one direction from the central position, and will usually lead to an underestimation
of the lift and an exaggeration of the dra,g. To find the limitation thus placed on the maximum
initial sensitivity the same method may be employed as that already used for finding the minimum
permissible initial sensitivity. If the rate of change of longitudinal force be taken as 1 per cent
per degree of yaw the upsetting moment due to a movement of the balance through the angle M
(circular measure) is .57 X X M X h. For continued stability, this must be less than the righting
moment due to gravity, wx~e. Equating the two, the condition of stability becomes

WXo= >O.57Xh

The same method may be applied to the lift and leads to the conclusion that, with a model
having a lift of 20 kg., the initial sensitivity must not be greater than 1.5 gms. This would be an
extreme value of the lift, and it is seldom necessary to reduce the sensitivity below 0.5 gm. on
account of the variation in lift, but, on the other hand, it is seldom that actual use could be made
of the ensitivity of 0.1 gm., previously taken as the standard for which it was nesessary to provide
Only on stream-line bodies, struts, and similar objects of small resistance would the possible
accuracy of measurement be as gre~t as this. It is in some respects a disadvantage of the . P. L.
type of balance that its" statical sensitivity" must be the same in respect of lift and drag.
Y, the third of the three forces acting on the model is perpendicular to the plane of symmetry,
and does not exist so long as the wind direction is parallel to that plane. As soon as the balance
moves from its position of equilibrium, however. the model aSRumes an angle of yaw, and this
gives rise to a force Y which is almost always negative for a positive angle of yaw and vice
versa. The magnitude of Y for a given angle of yaw varies widely with the type of model and
with conditions of test, generally being largest, relatively to the lift, at small angles of attack.
The absolute values of Yare virtually independent of the angle of attack. For an angle of
yaw of 1°, Y may be as high as 2 per cent of the lift for complete models at an angle of attack
of 0 0 , or about 1 per cent of the lift at 4 0 • This force is largest when the wings have a considerable
amount of dihedral or sweep back. In the Cl1se of fair-shaped objects, such as airplane bodies
and airship envelopes, Y at an angle of yaw of 10 is usually from 10 per cent to 35 per cent of X.
With models of the size used in the Langley Field wind tunnel, and with a ,,,ind speed of 50 m .
per second, Y has a maximuJU value of about 50 gms. for bodies and 100 gms. for complete
models.
If the origin of thereference axes is directly over the pivot when in equilibrium Y has no effect,
as its line of action always passes through the pivot. If, however, as is usually the case, the
model is set up with the origin forward of the vertical through the pivot Y will tend to produce
instability in r espect of the drag measurements, while not affecting the movements of the lift
arm. If the origin is above (in the model, not in the tunnel; i. e., nearer to the upper wing
than) the verticlll through the pivot Y will tend to decrease the sensitivity in lift, assuming
that the two arms oscillate synchronously, without affecting the measurements of drag. The
opposite positions will, of course, hllve opposite effects. The magnitudes of these effects are
very small. They would seldom modify the sensitivity by more than 0.02 gm., and they need
not be taken into account, provided that the model is so supported thl1t the origin is reasonably
close to (within 8 cm., in the case of a tunnel 1.5 meters in diameter) the vertical through the
main balance pivot.
There remain only the yawing and rolling moments to be considered. Bothof these, denoted
by Nand L, respectively, make their appearance, like Y, as a result of the assumption 9f Iln
angle of yaw, and do not exist while the wind direction is parallel to the plu.ne of symmetry.
The analysis of the action of these moments need not be followed through in detail. The first is
unimportant, while the rolling moment, which may assume a considerllble vlllue in the case of Il
model or a wing with marked sweep back or dihedral, acts to increase the sensitivity in lift, and
is therefore opposed to the effect of the change of lift itself for motions in one direction, while
acting with it for motions in the opposite direction from the central position. The ma..~imum
value of the effect of the rolling moment is about 15 per cent of the maximum unstabilizing
effec t which may arise due to changes of the lift with angle of yaw.

WIND TUNNEL BALANCES.

625

It appears from this consideration of the various forces and moments and their variations
that their effects on the sensitivity of the balance are usually very slight, but that they may become important, especiallywith regard to the liftmeasurements,forsomemodels. Since the most
important factoJ:S are the variation of the lift and drag, and since the magnitudes of these forces
and the moment arms at which they act are quite independent of the location of the model with
respect to the vertical through the pivot, this location has less effect on the sensitivity than
might have been anticipated, although it is by no means a factor to be neglected. The position
at which the spindle supporting the model is attached can be chosen, within fairly wide limits,
from considerations of ease of attachment and of minimum interference with airilowaboutthe
model, rather than with any idea of modifying the effects of Y, L, and N.
The distribution of the effect on sensitivity of the three factors variable with position ( Y, L,
and N) depends on the location in the model of the arbitrarily chosen origin, and anyone of
these three can be made to have any desired effect by properly placing the origin. The total
effect of the three, however, will manifestly be entirely independent of the position of that point.
There are certain types of balance in which the model moves always parallel to itself, and the
forces accordingly are subject to no change during the oscillation of the instrup1ent. These will
be briefly discussed later.

POSSIBLE SOURCES OF ERROR IN BALANCES OF THE N. P. 1. TYPE.
In order that some conception may be gained as to the relative accuracy necessary in the
construction of the various parts of a balance, and as to the magnitudes of the errors which
cr eep into the measurements from many sources, both tho e which are avoidable by careful
construction and use and those which are inherent in the design of the instrument, these several
sources of error will be taken up and analyzed separately.
(1) The first cause of errors in the determination of force and moments, and one of the
most important, is the deflection of the vertical portion of the balance under the force acting on
the model. In measuring forces, since the portion of the balance belo,,- the main pivot is subjected to no transverse forces except tha minute ones due to the resistance of the oil in the dashpot, all of the deflection takes place between the pivot and the model. In the case of a balance
in which, as in that at Langley Field, the weighing arms are trussed by tie-rods, virtually all the
deflection when the lower pivot is not engaged occurs above the point of attachment of these
tie-rods. When pitching moments are being taken, however, the lower pivot is thrown into
po ition to keep the balance axis vertical, and the deflection in the portion of the balance between
the two pivots m~y be of considerable magnitude.
The error which deflection causes in the measurement of forces is due to the movement of the
model and the upper portion of the balance with respect to the vertical throuO"h the main pivot.
This movement changes the moment of the weight of the model about the pivot when the weighing
arms are in the central position, and so changes the amount of weight required to keep the balance
in equilibrium. Since the deflection is proportional to the load applied, and the error for a given
weight of model is proportional to the deflection, the percentage error is quite independent of the
load applied. It is nece sary, then, in order to secure a definite percentage accuracy, that the
balance and spindle be just a.s stiff and heavy for tests at 10 meters per second as for those at 50.
Furthermore, since the balance, chuck, and spindle are cii'cular in cross section at all points, the
percentage error in lift due to deflection will be the same as that in respect of drag, except for the
portion caused by the deflection of the model itself. The error here will be greater in lift than in
drag at small angles of attack, as the model aorofoil bends much more readily about an axis
parallel to the chord than about one perpendicular to the chord. At angles of 4° or more the
resultant force is nearly perpendicular to the chord, and the difference just spoken of between
lift and drag therefore does not appear. By far the largest part of the deflection error arises
from the bending of the spindle which supports the model and which must have a small outside
diameter in order that the interference with the flow of air may not be excessive. The deflection
error always exists and is perfectly determinate in magnitude and sign, so that it can be computed
or determined experimentally and correction made for it. This 1S sometimes done, but it is
preferable to make the balance stiff enough so that no correction will be required.
In the quantitative discus ion of deflection eiTects the English system of weights and measures
will be used, as the constants of materials will be much more familiar in that system than in the
metric to most readers. The deflection of the balance at Langley Field, from the pivot to the
upper end of the trumpet top, a total length of 33 inches, is 0.00071 incb under a load of 1 pound,
applied at the center of the tunnel, and the slope at the upper end of the trumpet top when the
balance axis is vertical is 0.000099 per pound of load. With an aeroioil 60 by 10 cm. (approxi627

mately 24 by 4 inches), supported at its lower end by a spindle tapering in diameter from -h inch
at the point of contactwith thewing to 1 inch at the point where it enters the chuck, the total deflection, neglecting the bending of the aerofoil itself, is 0.0076 inch rer pound. The deflection of
an aluminum aerofoil, in respect of lift, may augment this by 0.0204 inch per pound, making a
total of 0.02 0 inch per pound with an aluminum modeL The corre ponding figure for a teel
aerofoil is 0.0144 inch. There is also likely to be some permanent yielding at the joint between an
aluminum aerofoil and its spindle, due to the softness of the alunlinum. The remedy is to drill
and cut a thread deeper into the model or to mortise the spindle into the wing and rivet them
together.
The weight of an aluminum aerofoil of average thickness and 24 by 4 inches in plan form is
from It to 2 pounds, and its center of gravity has just been shown to move 0.02 0 inch under a
lateral load of 1 pound perpendicular to the chord. (This is actually the distance that a point
fL'(ed in the plane of the chords of the aerofoil and halfway between the tirs moves. The displacement of the center of gravity is a little greater, due to the bending of the wing, but the di:ITerence
between the distance as just computed and that actually traveled is not very important.) The
weight of the steel spindle is 1.26 pounds, and the distance moved by its center of gravity under
a load of 1 pound is approximately 0.0015 inch. The total moment about the pivot due to
these di.splacements with a 2-pound model is
(2 X 0.02 0)

+ (1.26 X 0.0015) =

0.0560 + 0.0019 = 0.0579 lbs.

IDS.

This is equal to the moment given by a lateral force of 0.00107 pound applied 54 inches above
the piYot. The error in the measurement of the forces on' a model aerofoil caused by the deflections of balance, spindle, and model is then about 0.11 per cent. If the model aerofoil is made
of steel instead of aluminum its weight is about 5 pounds, and the possible error in lift measurements is increased to 0.14 per cent despite the greater stiil'ness of the steel. It is evident that,
both to keep down the deflection error and to reduce the weight resting on the pivot, aluminum
is the material par excellence for models, and steel should only be used when it is desired to
grind a standard wing to form with the highest possible degree of accuracy, or when the model
is to be tested at so high a wind speed that an aluminum model would be likely to be stre eel
beyond its elastic limit. EYen where accuracy of construction is the clominant consideration
aluminum is but little inferior to steel, although the aluminum is, of course, much more liable to
be bent or otherwise in:iured by careless handling. Brass, sometimes used for model in the past,
is thrown quite out of consideration by its hio-h density and low modulu of elasticity and
stilTness.
.
The deflection of a complete model is somewhat less than that of a single wing under the same
load, as the parts of the model tend to reenforce each other, even where the wing bracing is
omitted. For a model weighing 10 pounds, a figure which should seldom if ever be exceeded
with models of the size used in the Langley Field tunnel the error due to deflection should
always be less than one-half per cent. This is large enough, so that some allowance for it would
be required, but IO-pound models are fortunately the exception rather than the rule, and
deflection eil'ects can usually be ignored in the measurement of forces with this balance,
although they have proved a very important factor with some balances of similar type.
The effect of deflection on the determination of pitching moments, and so of centers of
pressure and vector diagrams, may become important with aerofoils of little stiffncss tested at
high speeds.
ince moments are measured with reference to a vertical axis passing through the
pivots, any deflection of the model support will shift the position of this axis in the model. This
will result in the moments actually being measured with reference to a different axis from that
experimentally determined before or after the run. Since all parts of the balance itself are
circular in section the line of resultant deflection will be parallel to the lini:l of action of the resultant force on the modeL A shifting of the axis of moments parallel to the line of action of
the resultant force manifestly does not affect the magnitudes of the moments, and the deflections of the balance proper can therefore have no effect on the determination of the location of
the vectors. The model, however, does not, by any means possess radial symmetry and the di-

rection of its deflection is almost constant and independent of the direction of the force acting,
since only the component of that force which i perpendicular to the chQrd of the aerofoil i
eirective in bending the model. Strictly speaking, the component of interest is that perpendicular to the principal axis of the section, not to the chord, but the two are nearly coincident. The
principal axis have been determined for a number of ection , nnd the angle bet,,~een the principal
axes and the system of axes parallel and perpendicular to the chord wa not, in any case, more
than 1~0. The deflection of the average aluminum model due to. its o,"vn bending alone has
been shown to be 0.0204 inch per pound, or 0.204 inch under a load of 10 pounds, which is
the maximum that most aero foils of cast aluminum alloy ",ill safely sustain. The deflection
under unit load is only one-third as much fOl' a teol model as for an aluminum one, but the maxi·
mum load liable to be u tained i about four times as great, so that the maximum total deflection for a steel model is in the neighborhood of 0.27 inch. The angle between the vector
of resultant force and the principal axis of maximum moment of inertia i never much more
than gO at any angle of incidence from 0° to 18°. The error in determination of the
center of pre sure or vee-tor position ,yould therefore not ex 'eed t\\'o-thirteenths of the deflection
of the model, and the largest error in that determination for an aluminum aerofoil u hjected to
a force of 10 pounds would not exceed 0.031 inch, or O. pCI' cent of the chord. Over the most
pOl'tant range of angles, that in which most !lormal flying is done, from 1 ° to 8°, the error
would be Ie s than half as large as this. In general, it may 1e said that it is necessary to make
some allowance for the effect of model deDection on pitching moment when the test is run at
a wind speed of 30 meter per second (approximately 66 miles per hour) or more with an alumipeeds above
num, and at a speed of 50 meters per second or more in the case of a steel, model.
the latter figure are never reaohed in the course of ordinary testing, and, indeed , the former is
seldom exceeded.
Although it has no direct effect on the accmacy of the measmements the deflection of the
lower tube is of some intcrest a affccting the displacement of the model with respect to the fairwater when moments are ~eing measured and as contributing another possible source of flexural vibration. The eil'ect of this deilection is to increase the displacement of the model under
a 20-pound load by 0.161 inch.
(2) The deflection of the weighing arms also has some effect] arising from two different
sources] on the aocuracy of the result. In the first place, since deflection throws the point
of support of the weights below the horizontal plane through the main pivot when the balance is
in equilibrium] the ensitivity is affected] as has been shown in another ection of the report.
Secondly, the instrument is balanced up initially ,,,ith the cross hairs in line when the two pivots
are engaged and wi.th little or no weight on the ends of the weighing arms. It may be assumed
that the -weight on the end of the arms when balancing up is just sufficient to balance the counterweights and other eccentrically placed parts, so that the center of gra,ity of the whole assembly is directly below the main pivot. If more weight be added, deflecting the arm, the cross
hairs will no longer be in line, and if the balance axis is tilted to bring the tip of the arm back to
the central position the center of gravity will be moved to one side and will exert a restoring
moment when the only moment supposed to be acting are those due to the force on the model
and the weights added on the weighing arms to balance that force. Obviou ly the error from
tHis somce is greatest when the center of gravity of the balance itself is farthest below the pivot,
If the length of the weighing arm, from the pivot to the point of application of the weights, is
l and its deilectfon is 0, the angle of rotation from the initial position of the balance in order to
bring the cross-hairs into alignment after deflection is

The righting moment due to the weight of the balance being displaced with respect to the pivot
is then K x 0, or KX; wbere K is the product of the weight of the balance and model by the ver-

is ShOW11 el ewhere that 47,000 gm. em., or 40.7 pounds inches. is a fair value for Kin a balance
the size of the one at Langley Field. If the arms were made, as in the original N. P. L. balance,
of solid steel rods -H inch in diameter acting as cantilevers, the deflection in a length of 23
inches under a load of 40 pounds (corre pondinO' to 20 pounds on the model) would be 0.140
inch. With the value of K given above, thi "'ould cau e the weight applied to be in error by
0.25 pound, or 0.6 per cent of tbe total amount. The error due to the deflection of the wcighing arm, like that due to the defleetion of the balance head, is directly proportional to the force
aoting, and the percentage error i therefore independent 'of the force.
On the Langley Field balance the ,\'eighing arms are steel tubes, 1 inch in diameter outide and with a wall thicknes of 0:06 inch. They are tru ed by tie-rous ft inch in diameter, and making an angle of· 12°. 5 with the direction of the arm it elf. The deflection of one of
the e arms under an end load of 40 pounds is 0.027 inch, due chiefly to the elongation of the
tie-rod, if the rod an 1 arm are perfectly straight. It i almo t impos ible to keep the tie-rod
absolutely traight, especially where one end is crewed directly into a lug, and the actual deflection is liable to be a little greater than that computed. The deflection with tubular trussed
weighing arms i , however, alway ' much less than with olid cantilever arm of the same out ide
diameter, and the tru eel arms also ha e a great advantage in respect of weight, as has been ' hown
already. The error arising from the deflection of the
weighing arms, if they arc properly designed and if the
en itivity is adju ted with reasonahle care before starting a te ' t, may becli regarded.
(3) A very troublesome source of error, and one which
is sometime difficult to eliminate, is the sliding of the
main pivot in its socket. If the pivot moves, the point of
contact between the two surfaces will, in general, be
hifted both on the pivot and in the socket. TIllS shifting
change the moment of the "'eight of the balance itself
about the pivot, and so changes the amount of weight
which mu t be added to secure initial equilibrium with
no fOl'ce on the model. If the shifting of the pivot
occurs during a run, between the times of taking the
B
"zero reading" and that with the wind on, the change
in the amount of weight required for balancing will app ar

as an error in the result of the measurement.
Balances may be constructed with the pivot pointing either upward or downward. In
the first ca e the pivot is carried by the balance upport; in the second case by the balance
itself. Enlarged views of the two di positions, both in the normal position and with the
balance lipped lightly to one ide, are shown in Fig. 11. The difference between the points
of contact in the original and displaced position. i indicated in the drawings. The first type
of eontact considered will be that in which, as in the drawings, the pivot and socket in the
neighborhood of the point of contact are each a segment of a sphero. It will be noted that
when the pivot i pointing upward the point of contact moves in the balance by a distance
nearly equal to the di tance which the balance slip (that i , the point of contact remains very
close to its original position on the upport), but that, in the converse case, the movement of
the point of contact in the balance is very light. If the downward-pointing pivot rested on
a flat urface the point of contact would not move at all in the balance and there would be no
error due to slippage of the balance with 1'e pect to the upport, but this disposition is
obviou ly impractical, a the balance would quickly slide, impelled by the horizontal force
acting on the model, into a po ition pre ed up against the side of the socket l where it could
not rock at all.

It is evident from the preceding that the pivot hould be carried by the moving portion
of the balance, and that it should point downward. This has another advantage in that the
socket, being concave upward, can be kept filled with a thin oil to reduce the sliding friction
between pivot and socket. The formula for the displacement of the point of contact in the
moving portion of the balance is:

~=~
RI-R2
where x is the distance which the balance slide , parallel to itself, with reference to an axi3
fixed in space, and RI and R2 are the radii of curvature of the socket and pivot, respectively.
It appears from this that it would be advantageou , aside from all que ·tion of friction, to
make the pivot a sharp as po ible and to employ a large radiu of curvature in the ocket.
The first deduction i perfectly correct, but the radius of curvatUTe of the so ket is of minor
importance, so far a the effect of lippage of the pivot is concerned, since it is the lope of the
tangent plane at the point of contact, and not the distance moved, which limits the slip of the
pivot. The ratio between the vertical and horizontal forces acting on the balance ranges
between 0 and 1- as limits, but seldom exceed 0.35. (The value t could not he reached unless
the balance it elf were weightle s.) Taking 0 and 0.35 as the limits, it appears that the
inclination to the horizontal of the surface on which the balance would rest in equilibrium, if
there were no friction, lies between 0° and 19°. The pivot would rest in the bottom of the
socket while the "zero reading " were being taken, and would lide up onto the inclined
pOl·tiop of the socket when a horizontal pressure was exerted against the mouel. If the total
weight of the balance and model (not including the weights required to balance the force on
the model) is Wand the horizontal force acting is L , the angle of inclination of the common

In the Langley Field balance W is 2 ,000 gms., h is 137 cm., and the maximum value of
L is about 18,000 gms. Under these condition the possible error due to slipping of the pivot
if there were no friction would be 5.75 R2 gms., where R2 is given in mm. The maximum
percentage of error occurs when L is very small, and is, for the case just cited, 0.072R2 per
cent. With the usual values of R2 this is not important.

These figures have been based on the neglect of sliding friction, a factor which generally

can not by any means be disregarded. If the coefficient of friction between the pivot and its
ocket is 0.2 the angle of inclination of the surface at the point of contact may be more than
5° when there is no force acting on the model. Using the figures just given, it appears that
shifting of the pivot may cause a constant error of 1.2 R2 gillS.
If the socket were truly conical, there could not be any sliding of the pivot, but the sensitivity of t.h e balance would be decreased by friction, as the slightly rounded pivot would make
contn.ct with its socket an around the circumference of a circle, and the relative motion between
the two for any rocking of the balance would be sliding instea.d of pure rolling.
(4) A factor whose importance is frequently underestimated is the canting of the model
,hIe to inaccurate alignment of the spindle. When the spindle is screwed into an aerofoil it is
very difficult to get the tapped hole exactly parallel to the leading edge, and the result is that
the model usually has a distinct tilt, either in yaw or in roll, from the desired position. If the
tilt is in respect of yaw the plane of symmetry of the model is no longer parallel to the wind
direction. In this general ca e there are SL,{ forces and moments to deal with in place of the
three which exist when the model is placed exactly correct. To illustrate the importance
of the various factors the ' effect of each of the s!..-x quantities will be followed through in turn for
an angle of yaw of 2°, this being a value which should not be exceeded if reasonable care is
taken in fitting the spindle to the model. The forces and moments on the Clark tractor biplane
model will be used in the illustrative example, these data having been obtained at the wind
tunnel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.1
Denoting the forces by X, Y, Z, and the moments by L , ]J![, and N in the usual manner,
the figures with the model, of 48 cm. span placed symmetrically are, for a wind speed of 15
meters per second and various angles of attack:

It appears that an angle of yaw of _2 ° may lead to errors of from 1 per cent to 3 pel' Gent
in the measurement of the drag, and that, in order to keep the error within the desired maximum
of -l per cent, the angle of yaw must not exceed 0':'2. This ideal is perfectly possible to realize
mechanically, but the spindle itself deflects at small angles so that the slope at its tip in the
plane of the wing chords is slightly more than 0':'2 when tests are run at 50 meters per second.
The error in lift measurement due to the model being set up at angle of yaw must be found
in the same way. The total moment about an axis passing through the balance pivot and
parallel to the tunnel axis is
MI. =Zh+ M sin if;- L cos if;

The error in lift is obviously much smaller than that in drag, and it is the accuracy desll.'ed
in the latter measurement that controls the degree of precision necessary in alignment.
To complete the analysis the effect of yaw on the moments about a vertical axi must be
discussed. The equation for the total moment is

These differences between the true and the apparent moments correspond to errors of 0.030 ,
0.027, and 0.004 cm., respectively, in the location of the vector of resultant force . These errors
are negligible, the largest being less than ~ per cent of the wing chord.
In short, then, it appears that the accurate alignment of the model in yaw is of impot'tancc
primarily as regards drag and that its importance there is considerable. If the data for a f,ingle
aerofoil, instead of for a complete model, . are taken the importance of accurate alignment is
lessened, as Yand iV, which cause most of the di.fficulty, both arise largely from the body and
tail surfaces. For bodies and other streamline forms, on the other hand, the relative importance
of accurate alignment is greater than for models of complete airplanes.
The analysis of the modifications in the measurements when the model is tilted in roll
instead of in yaw is much simpler, since the axis of the tunnel remains parallel to the plane of
symmetry of the model, which merely rotates about it. There are, therefore, no rolling 01'

unaffected, as i the C
UI've of lift coefficient against L ID. Although the aCCUI'ate determination
of angle of attack i not of much intere"L in routine commercial testing (if a designer can
obtain a CUI've of horsepower required against ai r 'peed for his machine, h e i ordinarily quite
satisfied without knowing the exact angle of attack corre ponding to a given peed ), it i ~ of
great importance in such work as the determination of correction factor for aspect ratio, etc.,
where a slight uncertainty a to alignment may make it quite impossible to draw any consistent
conclusions from a set of tests. Provi ion should therefore be made for lining up ,vings within
0?05 whenever it become nece ' ary to do so. This degr ee of accUI'acy can be secured, with
gr eat care in ighting and with a batten carefully picked for it t rai ghtnes, by the common
m ethod of binding a batten to the face of the "'ing and sighting it against a line 'painted on the
floor of the tunnel, but it is more accurate and ea"ier [or the ob ' erver to use orne optical method.
(7) A much more important source of error than the misalignment of the model is the misalignment of the balance with respect 1,0 the wind. In order that the lift and lrag, acting perpendicular and par allel to the wind, may be measured directly the arms of the balance must themselves b e set exactly perpendicular and parallel to the wind direction. If they are not, the force
acting on the'model ",vill be re 'olved into component along 'orne other axes than tho e desired
and a large error may be introduced in at lea"lt one of the components.
If the components of force perpendicular and parallel to the wind direction be r epr e~ ented
by Land D , re3pectively, and if the balance be supposed to rotate as a "hole about a vertical
axis so that the drag arm makes the angle e with the wind direction, e being taken as positive

value of L ID of. 1 , the error in drag measurement when 0 is 1 ° is more than 30 pel' cent. If
the drag is to b e measured accurately within one-fourth per cent, the balance must be lined
up with the drag arm parallel to the wind to within 0.00 0 . A similar relative accuracy of
m easurement of the drag with models of complete airplanes, having a maximum LID of ,
requires an alignment correct within, 0.018°. Such accuracy as this is h ardly to be expected,
and errors in alignment of the b alance arms are the largest single cause of error in the determination of the L ID at small angles; but a surprisingly close alignment (well within 0.05 ")
can be secured and maintained by careful setting up of the instrument and constant checking

ANNUAL REPORT NATIO AL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The method originally used in this country for aligning the balance arms with respect to
the wing in balances of the N. P. L. type required the use of a flat plate. This was tested at
several positive and negative angles. If the plate, the balance arms, and the wind direction
were all properly disposed with respect to each other, the lifts for equal positive and negative
angles should be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, and the drags should be equal. If
the fu'st of these conditions was fulfilled but the ~econd was not, it indicated that the zero
angle of attack had been properly located, but that misalignment of the balance arms existed.
The flat-plate method was unsatisfactory chie11y because of the low efficiency of such a surface.
It has just been shown that the error in drag measurements caused by misalignment of the arms
is proportional to the LID ratio. When the LID ratio is small, therefore, as it always is in a
flat plate, it is exceedingly difficult to detect small errors in alignment, errors which may nevertheless have an important effect on the measurement of drag in a high-efficiency wing. Furthermore, it is difficult to secure a plate which is and will remain truly flat. Inaecuracies of
surface too small to be detected by any ordinary means of measurement may cause a distinct
difference between the lift-drag ratios at equal positive and negative angles. This difficulty
was overcome in part by repeating the work with the plate turned through 180 0 about a
vertical axis.
.
The method now adopted and first introduced by the N. P. L. several years ago substitutes
a model aerofoil for the 11at plate. The aerofoil is drilled and tapped for a spindle at each end,
so that it may be supported in an inverted as well as in the normal position. Tests are then
run in both positions and the L/D curves compared. Since the lift in the invcrted position
must be balanced by the removal of weight from the lift arm, it is usually necessary, in order
that angles up to 6 0 or 0 may be taken in this condition, that more weight be added to the
lift counterweight, thereby increasing the zero reading. This method permits of much more
accurate alignment than does the 11at-plate method. Its only important drawback is that
the model has to be taken down and set up again between tests; but, as ah'cady pointed out,
the chords for zero angle of attack in the two positions can be set parallel within 0~05 by
sighting along a batten, if care is exercised. The disadvantage is therefore not a serious one.
The use of an aerofoil in normal and inverted positions for checking up the alignment has
another advantage in that it points the way to eliminating the effect of spin in the air-stream.
The air drawn into the propeller has a tendency to follow a helical path of very large pitchradius ratio, so that the direction of the wind near the top of the tunnel is slightly different from
that near the bottom. If the direction of motion changes uniformly from top to bottom of the
tunnel, the force acting on a wing would be almost identical with that which would act if there
were no spin of the wind and if the direction of its motion were everywhere the same as that
which actually prevails at the center of the span of the aerofoil. The readings of the balance
in the two cases, however, would not be the same, since the moment arm about the pivot is
different for different elements of the model. For example, consider two elements of equal
area and at equal distances from the center of the span. The forces on the two elements will
then be F+~F and F-~F, where F is the force acting on an element of the same size located
at mid section, and the moment arms abou t the pivot will be h + ~ hand h - ~ h. The moments
for the two will then be
(F+~ F) (h+~ h) and (F-~ F) (h-~ h).
The mean of the forces on the two elements is, as aheady noted, equal to F, the force
which would exist everywhere if there were no spin. The mean of the moments is
(F+~F) (h+~h)

+ (F-~F)

(Fx h) + (~Fx ~h)

and is therefore different from the moment of an equal area at the middle of the wing. If, however, the wing be aligned so that the lifts at corresponding angles are equal in the normal and
inverted positions, the force read on the weighing arm is the true one, and the effect of spin is
eliminated. When the wing is set at zero angle of attack after being lined up in this way, the

('hord is not exactly parallel to the wind direction at mid span, but the readings of the weighing
arms are identical with those which would be obtained if thel"e were no spin in the wind and
the chord were set parallel to the wind direction. The alignment found in this way varia
slightly with the slope of the curves of lift and drag coefficients; and it also require, for accuracy, that the form of the aerofoil section be exactly symmetrical from tip to tip. It is best,
therefore, to carry through the work of alignment with two or three different models in succe sion and at several angle for each model. It is difficult to determine the maximum possible error due to misalignment in any specific case, but it is probably not over 1 per cen t
under the worst conditions when the balance is lined up carefully by this method.
( ) Clo ely allied to misalignment of the model with respect to the wind, in that the primary
effect of boLh is to cau e an error in the determination of the angle of incidell<"e, j Lhe torsion of
the spindle. The total twist of the spindle is negligible when a straight spindle i used attached
directly to the end of an aerofoil, since the torsional moment is then \'"ery small. For example,
with a force of 20,000 gms. applied] em. from the center of the spindle 23 em. long and tapering
in diameter from 25.4 IDID. to 14.3 mm., like that used at Langley Field, the twist would be Ie
than 0~05. There should never be any difficulty in keeping the spindle within 1 cm. of the center
of pressure of the chord at the angle of maximum lift. In complete models, where it is not alway
po sib1e to attach the spindle at the desired point, other parts of the model interfering, and w]Jerc
the point of application of the resultant force moves over a \vider range than on a single aeroIoi1,
this limit may ometimos be exceeded fiye or six time, so that the maximum twist may be 0~3 or
or a little more. This offers an addit.ional reason for so locating the spindle as to keep the pitching moment as small as pos ible. EYeD 0~3 , ho\',e\'"er, is ordinarily of slight importance except
where accurate checks on two or more SU('ce sive tests with some slight variation in the conditions are desired. As has already boen pointed out, errors in angle of incidence up to about a
quarter of a degree need cause no trouble in ordinary tests of complete models.
(9) The errors so far discussed ha\'"e all arisen either from such inescapable phenomena a
the deflection of thespinclle Or from improper mounting and alignment of the instrument or model
Those which remain to be discussed are due to error in the construction of the balance it elf, and
may all be eliminated or reduced to insignificance by sufficiently accurate workmanship. The
analy is of the sources of the e error and of the magnitudes which they may assume is of value
primarily in that it indicates the accuracy necessary in the construction and a scm bly of the
different part.
'rhe first, and perhaps the most ob"ions, of the points at which errors ari e from failure to
follow' the design with absolute exactitude is the length of the weighing arm. Obviously, if
the \veighing armS,or either one of them, arc longer than they are in tended to be, a weight 'uspended
at the end of the long arm will balance a force at the center of the tunnel of morc than half its
own magnitude. The error in the reading will be directly proportional to the departure from the
designed length. The permissible error in measurement ha so far been taken a onG-fourth pel' cen t ,
but thiswill be reduced, in the ca e of the constant instrumental errors, toO.] perc-olltfrom each
SOUl"<.'c. · It is then permi sible for the weighing arm to vary in length 0.1 per cent in either direction, or, in the Langley Field balance, 0.6 mm. A skilled man should not have the slightest
difficulty in keeping the error down to one-fourth of this amount, and the a(·cura(·y sometimes
ought for in this particular is really quite needless.
The same consideration of course apphe with regard to the distanee from the pivot to the
center of the model, the permissible variation here being twice a great as that in the lengths of
the weighing arms. If there is an error in this di tance, or if there is a common error in the lengths
of the two weighing arms, the leverage ratio Can be restored to its proper value by modifying the
distance which the spindle of the model is allowed to projer't from the chuck whi('h attache it
. to the balance.
(10) Another difficulty in connection with the weighing arms is their attachment exactly at
right angles to each other. 1£ they- are not so attached errors will be caused in the measurement
of the lift or drag, or both. The analytical \,-ork invol\'"ed in the determination of these errors
need not be followed through in detail in this report. If the arms are not at right angles the

alignmenL of Lhe arms in order that the lifts and drags may both be the same at equal angles of an
aerofoil in the normal and in\'"erted positions will be clillerent for every different aerofoil used and
for every angle at which the te ts for alignment arc carried out. If, however, the alignment be
supposed to hav-e been carried out to sati fy the aboYe condition as accurately as po sible for a
given model and angle of incidence there ,,"ill still be an error in both lift and drag. The ratio of
relatiYe error between the two components is proportional to the ratio of the slope of the coefficient curve to the ordinates of those cun"e at the parLieular angle for which alignment was carried
out. At all angles bet\\-een that of minimum drag and that of maximum lift the error in both
components is in the same dirC',tion. so that the error in L/ D is less than that in either component alone. The balance readings are farthest astray from the true values in measuring the
drag near the burble point, where a variation of 0?1 in the angle between the arms may lead to
an error of nearly 2 per cent in the drag. This error falls oft' rapidly at angles smaller than th
burble point, and the mi take made in the determination of the forces at angles between 0° and
0, Lhe range which is of most interest, would never be more than 0.03 per cent for a departure
of 0?1 from a right angle betwecp. the arms. An accuracy of O?3 in this angle is quite sufficient,
if the balance i lined up in Lhe manner here described, and if, in lining up, test are made at
several angles lying between 2° and 0, the mean result being taken.
(11) If the strut and pring clomp which prevent the balance from rotating about a -vertical axi arc not horizontal the force which they exert against the arm will ha-ve a vertical
component and will change the amount of weight which must be placed on the lift arm to secure
equilibrium. If there is no pitching moment on the model the upward or downward component
of the thrusL of the truL again t the arm will be exactly balanced by an equal and oppo ite
component of the pull of the clamp. If there is a pitching moment, however, one of these two
forces will be greater than the other and there will he an unbalanced >ertical component. Asuming the moment arm of the resultant force with respect to the balance axis to be 4 C111., the
moment i approximately 4L, where L is the lift. This moment has Lo be balanced by th
difference between the forces in the strut and spring clamp. If the vertical component of
thi difference i not to cause an error of more than 0.1 per cent in the mea urement of L it must

For the Langley Field balance this formula give a limitino- lope of 2°, a limit which would
hardly be approached ii any special precaution were taken.
(12) If the strut and clamp are horizontal, but are above or below the main pivot, the
difference in the forces which they exert will have a moment tending to modify the reading of
the drag arm. Since the di tance between the piv-ot and the point at which the trut bear;,;

the two opposing forces is, for a moment of 4L, -0.13L gms. If r be the vertical distance from

BRIEF NOTES ON BALANCES OF OTHER TYPES.
In discussing other types of balances, no attempt will be made to carry through any sucb
l!xhaustive analysis of ources of enol' as has been developed for the N. P. L. instrument. The
endeavor will be rather to show the reasons which led to the rejection of these other types in
favor of the one finally adopted for construction and use at Langley Field.
(1) EIFFEL.

The principle of operation of the EllIel balance is fully explained in his two books.' The
e sontial parts of tho in iTIlmont are bown diagrammatically in Fig. 14. Three readings
are taken at each angle of incidpllce, dpt('rmining the moments about axes A, B, and O.
From these three values can be computed
the magnitude and line of action of the resultant force on the model. In the actual
instrument used at the Eiffel laboratories
only two axes are used, 0 being omitted, and
0.
the moment about A is taken both with the
model in the normal position and with the
model inverted. The moments about A in
the normal and inverted positions, respectively, will be denoted by M, and M,' , the
moment about B by Mil.
If the force acting on the model be resolved into its components Land D, acting
at the point shown in the diagram, and the

Since the three moments are taken at dirrerent time the errors which appear in auy two

of the three due to variations in wind speed may be in the arne or in opposite directions, and
the wor L of th so conditions mu t be as umed in computing the maximum error which can
enter into the computed quantitie. The ma -imu111 error to be expected in any single mea urement is approximately proportional to the magnitude of th measur ment unle thi i
very mall, a 1110 t of the error i caused by iluctuation ill wind poe.d or by inaccuracies in
it mea urement. Land D are the r suIt of summation, and the maximum percentage
error in the e forces therefore can not exceed the maximum percentage error in the factors
from which they are determined. There hould be no difficulty in keeping thi below t per cent.
The only 1'6 triction that mu t be ob erved in order not to impair the accuracy of mea urement
of Land D i that the distance b InU t be large enough 0 that JIB will never become positive,
or even approach ery near to zero, under any ordinary condition. Thi requirement will

being approximately equal to a.
The error ari ing in the computation of pitching moment are likely to be more seriou ,
since that quautity is the differenc of two moment. The error vhich is of intere there i

in the spindle at any particular point :is not the same when the model is in the normal position
as when it is held inverted at the same angle, the de1lection will not be the same in the two
ca es. The moment about A in each po ition therefore includes a ter~ proportional to the
lift, and this term is different in the two positions. The failure to take account of the deflection of the model leads to errors in thc computation of both forces and the pitching moment.
The unequal deflections of the weighing arm when taking the two moment lead to an error
of the same nature. The error in the drag from this cau e may be as much as 3 per cent with
a spindle of normal size, and the percentage error increases as the wind speed increases. If
the spindle is enlarged to cut down the deflection it becomes a matter of · great difficulty to
allow for the increa ed spindle interference.
Furthermore, the drag of the model is :qot the same in the normal and inverted position,
he(;au e the cifecti-ve drao- of Lhe spinelle, due largely to interference, is quite dillerent when it
is attached on the upper surface of the wing from that when the pindle is mounted on the
lower surface. This causcs a further error in computing the pitching moment.
~ 0 detailed discussion of the error ari ing in the Eiffel type of balance will be undertaken.
Its chief disadvantages, in addition to the inherent inaccuracies already noted, are the time required for taking all the readings and working up the re ults therefrom, its great weight (the
moving parts of the balance at Eiffel's laboratory weigh 50 kg., although it i never required
to measure forccs in excess of 10 kg. ), and its lack
of sensitivity, discussed in the ncxt paragraph.
r
Its only important auvantnges reside in the
elimination of all piyots in fayor of knife-edges
and in the avoidance of serious errors due to
failure to line the balance up to the wind accurately. If the axes about which moments are
taken are not exactly perpcndicular to the wind
H

but ~Jhis does not appear to have been done in the instrument used by Eiffel. ~o dash pot is
incorporated, and it is therefore necessary to secure a good degree of stability of the beam in
order that it may not make continuou violent oseillations between the stops.
(2) THE ST_ CYR. BALANCE.

The balance used in the tunnel of the Institut Aerote hnique de St. Cyr is quite different
from any of the older and hetter-known types, and it embodies many original and interesting
features. The general arrangement is hown in Fig. 15. ABOD and EFGH are articulated
parallelogram. BGOH is a rio-id square h'ame.
The lift on the model cause the parallelograms EFGll and BGOH to rise, and ODN pivots
about D. The upward movement of 0 is transmt~ted through the links ODN and NU, and
raises the outer end of the weighing beam UIJ. Weight is added at J until this tendency to
rise is balanced.

The balance de igned by ])r. A. F. Zahm for the 4-foot tunnel of the Omtiss Engineering
Corporation i similar to the X. P. L. tY])e in general, but differs from it in that the single pivot
is replaced by two et of I-nife-edges at right ang-le to each other. The lift and drag are then
measured on ' eparate run. The knife-edge arc carried at the extreme end of the weighing

usually necessary in drag than in liit, and some tability in re pect of the liit measurements is
useful, especially at large angles where the lift arm tends to oscillate violently.
It was shown in Part II that the synchTonism of the movements of the model in two planes
affects the sensitivity in lift, the lift being modified by the angle of yaw which the model assumes
when the drag beam moves from its neutral position. This effect obviously does not appear in
the. urtiss balance, where the measurements of lift and drag are taken at different times.
In respect of most of the' errors discussed in Part III, and of the accm'acy necessary in the
sliding of various parts, the Curtiss balance stands on exactly the same footing as does the
. P. L. type. The balance carried on two widely separated knife-edges obviously needs no
strut and spring clamp to prevent rotation about a vertical axis, and the elimination of these
members, together with the natural superiority of a lmife-edge over a pivot makes the friction
in the Curtiss balance materially smaller than that in the single-pivot type. The only important
counterbalancing disadvantao-e is the time I' quired to make two separate runs.
Pitching moments are measured by an entirely self-contained device, making no contact
with the frame. The model is carried on a rod which passes down through the hollow upper
portion of the balance. The Jower end of the rod is pointed and rests in a conical socket. This
rod has attached (,0 it a horizontal bar which projects through a hole in the wall of the balance,
and which b ears against the end of (,he verti cal arm of a bell crank, on the horizontal arm of
which weight is hung to balance the pitching moments. The moment guide arm is carried b:v
the upper part of the balance proper, ",hich therefore never makes any contact with the balancl:'
frame except through the knife-edges. This method of measuring moments is essen ti all)'
similar in principle to that. used at Langley Field, has the same merits, and is subject to the
same criticisms.
(4) WRIGHT.

In the balance designed by Mr. Orville Wright, and used in his wind tunnel at Dayton, the
LID ratio can be found directly by measuring the slope of the vector. The model is carried by
one side of an articulated parallelogram, the opposite side of which is fix cl relative to the
tunnel. The model therefore' moves parallel to itself, and takes up a posi{'ion such that the two
free. sides of the parallelogram aTe parallel to the vector (if the plane' of the linkage is vertical,
the vertical links must, of course, be prolonged and counterweighted, the counterweights being
adjusted so that, with the model in place and no wind on, the linkage will remain in any position
in which it is set).
The major disadvantage of this ystem i tbe minuteness of the angles which must be
measured. If an L ID of 16 is to be determined with an error not in excess of 1 pel' cent, thl:'
slope of the vector must be read off correct within 0~036. This COlTCSl onds to a distance of
0.16 mm. at the tip of apointe'r 25 cm. long. '1'h<' di.fficulty of reading angles as closely as this
must always be considerable, even if the poinLer remains perfe .tly steady. With care, however.
the flexible linkage method i capable of o-iving very accurate results.
When the lift and drag are to be mea ured separately these forces are' balanced against the
drag on a wire screen. rfhe force is rrad directly from the position of a pointer on a scale,
and no such adjustments are necessary a had to bE' made in thl:' LanchE'stE'r and Dines balances (see Part II).
This balance is easy and quick to use, although it requires two runs to secure the lift and
clrag. It is hardly to be expected, however, that it can give the accuracy attainable by other
methods. If the same screen is used as standard thr'oughout a single test for wing drag, the
maximum force to be measured will be m.ore thf!.D. 10 times as large as the minimum, and the
inclination of the screen :must accordingly vary thr'ough nearly 90 °. The determination of the
smallest force to within 1 pel' cent would necessiLate the division of the scale into 1, 000 parts,
and the reading of divisions so fine as these would be exceedingly difficult, especially as thE'
pointer is certain to move slight1y, pulsations in ve]oci ty of the wind not affecting the wing ancl
the screen at the same time.

THE ELEMENTARY THEORY OF THE FLOW OF AIR THROUGH WIND TUNNELS.

If the air flowing through a wind tunnel and back through the room from the exit to the
entrance of the tunnel followed Bernouilli's theorem v,-ith exactness, there would be no change
in the energy possessed by a given particle of air, except for tpe loss due to friction, as the
kinetic energy lost on issuing frOIl). the tunnel would be restored in the form of pressure energy.
The power required to maintain the flow would then be

P=m x ii,
where hi is the head (in feet of air) lost by friction and m is the ma s of air flowing per second.
As the same mass of air must pa s every point in the tunnel, the product of mean air speed by
cross-section area must be a constant for its whole length, neglecting compressibility and changes
in temperatm'e during the passage. Since the major part of the frictional losses occm in the
reduced section of the tunnel (provided that it is not very short and that the diffu er is not so
constructed as excessively to hamper the travel of the air from the tunnel back into the room)
hi would be practically independent of the size and angle of the exit cone, and the power consumed would also be independent of these factors.
As a matter of fact the conditions of flow are not simple enough to permit the direct application of Bernouilli's theorem. Borda has shown that the loss of energy when fluid moving at
high velocity in a pipe is discharged abruptly into a large room or reservoir is equal to the
kinetic energy initially possessed. The kinetic energy is not converted into press me energy as
the theory indicates that it should be, and it is therefore profitable to use an exit cone of considerable length, in order that part of the kinetic energy may be saved by conversion into the
potential form before the sudden discharge into the room. The length to which it is desirable
to prolong the cone is limited by the growing loss by friction within the exit cone itself. A
more rapid conver ion of the kinetic energy by increa ing the vertex angle of the exit cone is
forbidden by the unwillingness of the air to change its comse suddenly and follow the walls of
the exit cone. If the vertex angle be made too large the effect is almost the same as that of
an abrupt increase in cross section. Eiffel, as the result of an elaborate theoretical and experimental research on tunnels having exit cones generated by straight lines, has come to the conelusion that the vertex angle of the exit cone should be not more than 7°, and that the diameter
at the large end of the exit cone should be three times that at the small end. It is necessary to
base the dimensions of a tunnel on a compromise, as the arrangement which would give the
absolute maximum of efficiency would have to be housed in a building of prohibitive size. The
over all length can be materially reduced at the cost of a slight increase in power, and the first
cost of the building, depending on its dimensions, must be balanced against the cost of operation, which varies with the power of the motor and so with the efficiency of the tunnel. \ The
relations to be observed among the various dimensions of the tunnel and the angles of the cones
will be discussed more fully elsewhere. Knowing the power consumed by a tunnel, its diameter, and the speed of the air, the total losse can easily be computed for that particular speed,

directly for two tunnels unless they are run at the same speed. The factor most commonly
used' for comparisons between tunnels is the ratio of the kinetic energy possessed by the air \
passing through the tunnel in unit time to the work done by the motor in unit time. 'fills is
sometimes called the" over-all efficiency," but it is herein alluded to as the" energy ratio." ./"
The term efficien y in this connection is misleading, as the two quantities introduced into the
ratio are not directly connected, but merely happen to have the arne dimensions and so to be
convenient for the purpose. Furthermore, the value of the ratio is vet'y commonly more than
1, and is sometimes very much more.
To determine the manner in which the power consumed varies with speed, and so detpl'mine the validity or otherwise of the above relation, as well as to find the relation whiCh mu t
be preserved among the various factors in order that geometrically similar tunnel may be
strictly comparable, the Theory of Dimensions may be used. The m thod pur ueit need not be
gone into in detail, as it has been described many times before, and it will sulfice to summarize
the results. It appears that, if the compressibility of the air and the action of gravity on it be
assumed to be of negligible importance at the speeds employed, the power ("onsumed is proportional, for geometrically similar tw:inels, to the cross-section area and to the cube of the peed ,
provided that VD where V is the au- speed, D the Lunnel diameter, and v the coefLicient of
v

kinematic viscosity, is maintained constant. Experiments conducted \"\"ith a model tunnel at
Langley Field and fully described elsewhere in this report, as well as those carried on by Durand,
Castellazzi, and others, show that the" energy ratio" \'"aries but little with ehanges of VD and
v

it is therefore safe to apply the results of model experiments to full-sized tunnels, even though
the speeds m'ay not be strictly in inverse ratio to the diameters. In general, the" energy ratio"
mcrea. es as VD increa es, and it therefore requires less power to eII-ive

predicted from a direct application of the results of tests on a model of the tunnel and propeller.

the weight of a column of air having a height equal to the total 10 of head and a cros -sectional area equal to the disc area of the propeller. Since the power i proportional to the cube
of the speed; the thrust varies as its square.
If the factor causing departure from Bernouilli' theorem are neglected, the useful work
clone in moving the air against friction will be, as already mentioned, independent of the d gree
of expansion of area in the exit cone, and so of the diameter of the l)I·opeller. Under these conditions, in fact, the advantage in respect of power consumed would rest with the short exit cone
and small propeller, a the propeller efficiency i highest for a large value of the " slip function"
and this is obtained by making the speed of the air till-ough the propeller high and keeping
suming that the output of work is the arne in all ca e ,
down the diameter of the propeller.
the thrust will be inversely proportional to the speed of air through the propeller, or directly
proportional to the disk area.

LA WS OF SIMILITUDE FOR WIND TUN EL PROPELLERS.

It is obviou from a study of the Drzewiecki theory of propeller action that a eries of propellers of similar blade form. and width-diameter ratio, all workinO" at the same true angle of
attack, will give thrusts approximately proportional to N2D4, where N j the engine speed in
revolutions per unit time and D the propeller diameter. Thi proportion can be demonstrated
by the Theory of Dimension to hold exactly true for geometricall y similar propellers of perfect
rigidity, but it i very nearly correct even where propeller of different pitches are cOJJcerned.
It has been shown that the thrusts of a eries of propellers de igned to drive the samp wind
tunnel or geometrically similar tunnels, is proportional to N2D\ and also to the cros - ection
area, which, in turn, varies as D2. It follows from the e two relations that N2D2 mu t be I)
constant, and the peripheral speed of the propeller required to draw air through a wind tunnel
at any particular speed will therefore be quite independent of the diameter of the propeller if
the power required is independent of that diameter. It follows as an obviou corollary that.
if the power required is not independent of the degree of expansion in the exit cone, the PC'ripheral speed of the propeller will be least under the arne conditions a those for which the
power required has its minimum value.
It i ea i1y demonstrable that the stresses, both those due to centrifugal force and those due
to bending by the air pres ure, in a series of geometrically similar propellers depen 1 only on
the peripheral speed, and that they vary as the square of that quantity. There is therefore 11
limiting peripheral speed which can not be exceeded with safety. For wooden propellers, it i
unsafe to run the peripheral speed much beyond 60,000 feet per minute, or 305 meter per second,
and it is better to stay well inside this figure. In the case of an airplane or airship whcre large
power must bo taken on a single propeller the peripheral speed can be reduced by gearing down,
as the engine speed decreases more rapidly than the propeller diameter increases. In the wind
tunnel, it has just been shown that this is not the ca e, and that the peripheral speed, and so
the stress, actually increases if the propeller diameter is enlarged beyond a certain point. Therp
is then a clearly defined upper limit to the power which it is safe to apply to driving the propeller in any given wind tunnel, and therefore a limit to the maximum spccd attainable. 1'his
maximum can only be raised by reducing the losse and so improving the over-all e1Ji.ciency
of the plant.
Since the power required to secure a given speed with a given" energy ra.tio" i proportional to the cros -sectional area of the tunnel, and is also proportional to V N2D4, the propeller
in a series of tunnels of different diameters operating at the same speed and having the arne
" energy ratio," all work at the same value of N2 D2, and so of the peripheral peed. Thi lead
to the rather astonishing conclusion that the peripheral speed nece sary to produce a given
air speed depends only on that air speed and on the energy ratio, and i not at all affectcd by the
size of the tunnel or of the propeller (except indirectly, in 0 far a the e factor have an eIrect OD
the energy ratio). For any value of the energy ratio, then, there is a limitin g air speed which
can not be exceeded wi thout running the periplleral speed up beyond the limit of safety, and
this speed is the ame for large tunncl as for mall, although the actual power con umeel of
course varies with the tunnel dinmeter. In order to realize the highest pos ible wind peed the
power coefficient of the propeller must be made as large a po si.ble. This can be done by using
many blades and by making them of high-lift scctions et at re1a.tively largc angle of attock.
If the velocities desired are too high to be obtained in thi way, it wjli be neces ary to usp t\\'O
or more propellers arranged in tandem, acting like a multi- taO" compre or.

the part of the blade in ide of any given point i very nearly proportional to thr cube of the
radius at that point. For example, one-eighth of the thrust would be given by the inner half

The increase in power coefficient by thc usc of a spinner, tho.propellel' pitch being ad.iu ted

a spinner or hub one-quarter the diameter of the propeller, 17 per cent when the ratio i onehalf, and 27 per cent when, a in the McCook Field tunnel, it is two-third. Furthermore, the
use of a very larO'o hub makes it possible to use more blade and make their total width a larger
.fraction of Lhe circumfer nce of the circle swept by the blades. In the McCook Field fan there
arc 24 blados, and their total width is approximately equal to the circum ference of the hub .
Where very high speeds are desired, as in the calibration of air- peed meter , a throttling
in ort has sometimes been used to reduce the section of a large tunnel. The rffec t is to increaso
t,he speed, but usually much Ie than is expected. If the (( energy ratio " remained constant,
hfl.lving the diameter of the tunnel would increase the speed available with a given expenditure
of power by 59 per cent. A change of this sort usually, however, dimini he the energy ratio
unlr, s the tunnel i of the type combining a long straight portion with conical ends, and permitting of the extension of the cones back into the traight cylin£h'ical part. rhe use of a throttling insert in a tunnel with a hort experimental ch..o'l,mber, like those used by Eiffel and Crocco,
is almost certain to lead to a hrge drop in energy ratio, and the inerea e of speed hy halving the
diameter in such a laboratory would probably be less that 50 per cent. Furthermore, it is
nece sary for best results that the propeller ordinarily used be replaced by ono e pecially designed
for use in conjunction with the throttling insert. If the diameter of the tunnel be halved the
area at the smallest ection i divided by foUl', and, even with an increase of 59 per cent in peed
at the throat or in the experimental chamber, the speed of the air past the propeller is reduced
by 60 per cent. Since the propeller diameter and its normal rotational speed to develop the
rated power are unchanged, the propeller for use with the throttling insert must have a much
smaller etrective pitch than that employed with the full section, if the maximum of efficiency is
to be obtained.
I In tlill analysis the ch;mgo oC density of the air, due to decrease of static pressure with increasing speed, is neglected . This docs not lead
t.o a very llrge error, as both tho propeller thrust and the frictional resistance to tho paSsage of the air increase with tho air density, tho former

RELATIYE ADVANTAGE OF SMALL AND LARGE TUN ELS.

It has just been hown that the gain in speed by reducing the diameter by the u e of n,
throttling in ert is disappointingly mall. This leads naturally to a study of the 1 t size of
;e
wind tunnel to be employed, and of the relation l:etween speed and ize which should Le ought.
In the construction of aerodynamical lac oratories, as the attempt has hen mnde to approach
ever more nearly to full-flight condition, two divergent chools of practice ha,e grO\vn up. The
frrst, best repre ented by the ~ ational Ph:- ical Lac ora tory in England, has con tantly increased
the diametrr of the wind stream, and so increased the size of model which may be tested, but has
remained content with rclati,ely moderate wind speeds. The econd, on the other lL.'l.nd, has
concentrated its efforts on the pumpin<:s of the air across a sm3.11 section at enormous velocity.
In compl1.rino- the merits of the high speed and the large diameter tunnel , there are three
points which mu t be borne in mind. In the frrst place, the highe t pos ible yalue of LV (L V
being the criterion of dynamic similarity) is to be obtained with n minimum expenditure of
power. Secondly, the interference between the model and its support is to be l' duced to a
minimum, and, finally, that disposition should be favored which enable us to secure the greate t
aermacy in the con truction of th models.
r t has been hown tha t
p= KA Tf3= K 1D2p
where D i the diameter of the tunnel and K{ is a constant.
In O1'der to avoid interference between the model and the walls of the tunnel, the ratio of
maximum sp::1l1 to tunnel diameter mu t not exceed a certain value (usually about 0.4). Setting
L, the span of the model, proportional to D, we can then modify the above equation:

The power required to drive the fan will therefore be least, for nny given value of L V, in thnt
trumel whore the diameter is largest and the speed is sIlL-'l.llest.
The relative magnitude of the interference between the model and its support, the so-called
"spindle eJIect" depends on the ratio of the spindle diameter to th linear dimensions of the
model. Its reduction is a matter of very vital importnnce, the spindle correction 'undoubtedly
being the largest single source of error in mo t wind-tunnel tests.
The bendino- moment in the spindle at any point (say one chord length from the ving tip)
is proportion.al to the product of the span by the force acting on the model.

Inl"espect of the thi ,·d consiclera tion, accuracy of construction of the model, the superi01 i ty
of the large tunncl, permitting the use of a large model, is so manifest a hardly to call for discussion. A model of 3-foot span can include many pal ts, such as fittings and wire, which it is
quite hopeless to put on one of half that size.
So far, t~e advantage has rested with the large diameter in every particular. It has one
disadvantage in that the size and weight of the bal:tnce are much increa ed, Ionow weiahing
arms, heavier counterweights, and a general strengthening up of the apparatus are necessitated.
Furthermore, the initial cost of the building to house a hl.1'ge tunnel is very high. In the writer's
opinion, however, the advantages far outweigh the drnwbacks, and any future development of
wind tunn('ls for model te ting should proceed along the lines of increasing the diameter rathor

DESI GN OF WI D TUNNEL PROPELLERS BY THE DRZEWIECKI THEORY.

It is possible, if them to of flow of the air through a wind-tunnrl propeller be known, to predict
theporformaneeof thepropd ler by the Drzewiecki theory. Ind.eecl, theapplicationof that theory
to wind-tunnel propellers is rn.(her impler than its application to the airplane, as there is no
in-tIm ught conedion to con tend wi tho If the veloci ty a t the minimum section of the tunnel is
given, the velocity through the prop('ller can be computed with absolute accuracy on the assumption that the distribution across the exit cone i uniform. This assumption can only justify
itself in the results of the analysis derived from it as a basis.
The best way of checking the accuracy of the analytical method of design is to apply it
to a proprller already wOI'king satisfactorily. This has been done with the pTopeller used in the
model wind-tunnel experiments desC1ubed in a later section of the report. The an9;le of the relative win(l to the plane of the propeller can be computed from the wind speed, and it is then possible, knowing the angles of blade setting, to work back and find the an;;le of attack of each
blade clement. Having this, the power consumed by the propell~r and its efficiency can be
found in the usual way. This was done for two case. In the first case the tunnel was of the
Eiffel type, ,,·ith an enlarged experimentnl chamber, and the calculated power checked the
actual consumption within the experimental elTor (about 2 pel' cent, owing to uncertainty as to
motor losses). In the econd. case the air stream wa inclosed throughout, a cylind.rical tube
being carried across the experimental chamber, and the power consumed was about 15 per cent
more than that calculated. I t is considered that both of these tests showed a very fair check
and that the use of the Drzewiecki theory for design is amply justified.. The average error,
both in these and in other cases which have been tried, is in the direction of underestimation of
the power consumption.

J,N "UAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS .

In designing a propeller for a new tunnel it is necessary to make an estimate of the energy
ratio, and so of the speed for a given power. If the estimate is too low, the propeller pitch will
be made too low, and the propeller will work at an inefficiently small angle of attack. The
~peed will be higher than that estlmated, but still not so high as it would be with a proper
propeller. If the propeller blades are made too narrow, or if too few blades are used, the full
power of the motor will not be absorbed at the rated revolution per minute. The speen will
then fail to reach the value expected for the rotational speed realized, the angle of the relative
wind to the plane of the propeller will fall below the estimated valu e, and the angle of attack
of the blade clements will become inefficiently large. Any change of this sort from the designed
conditions of operation tends to correct itself, as the larger angle of n,ttack increases the POWPI"
consumed and the thrust given by the propeller. This in turn speeds up the air ann brings the
angle of attack to a lower value. It is for this reason that fairly satisfactory results have so
frequently been secured with propellers chosen almost

usually be least where the deceleration is least. It is obvious, furthermore, that the flow through
the exit cone will be smoothest and least turbulent when the form of the cone is smooth, and
that any abrupt change of slope of the walls, such as that at the juncture of the parallel portion
of the tunnel with an exit cone generated by a straight line, is liable to cause the lines of flow
to break away from the contour of the tunnel wall, and to establish a region of "dead-water "

THE THEORY OF LOSSES IN THE EXIT CONE.

The 10 es in the exit cone of a wind tunnel ari e from three sources. The first is the friction against the walls, and is best determined by Fritzsche's formula for fluid fri ction. The
econd is the diverging angle of the cone, which. as already noted, always leads to a loss of
energy as compared with the ideal conditions expressed by Bernouilli 's theorem. The magnitude of this loss is determined with satisfactory accuracy by a fonmlla. devised by Fliegner.
Finally, there is a loss due to the sudden release of the air from the exit cone and its passage into
the room, where its velocity drops almost to zero. This loss was shown by Borda to be equal
to the kinetic energy posse sed by the air at the large end of the cone. These 10 es, and their
relation to the factors enterino- into wind tunnel de ign, together with all the 10 es in other rart
of the tunnel, have been fully discussed by Ei[el,t and it is not necessary to repeat his work here.
For the benefit of those de io-ning tunnels, however, a set of cur es has been plotted which
make it possible to read off at once tho loss in a straight conical exit cone of any type and .to
determine, o-iven the limiting conditions, such as size of buildii:tg to house the tunnel, the charince from 0 per cent to 90 per cent

problem of desio-ning a tunnel with a high energy ratio is e entially a problem of reducing the
losses in the exit cone.
In figure 6 the ordinates are the vertex angles of exit cones, the abscissae the ratio of the
cross-section aJ~oa at the large end of the cone to the cross-section area where model are tested,
at the throat or in the experimental chamber. The family of curves drawn in full linos are
curves of equal loss, and the number which each one bears expresses the loss in the exit cone as
a percentage of the kinetic energy possessed by the air at the mallest section of the tunnel.
For example, if there were no losses excopt those in the exit cone, a tunnel havino- an exit cone
of form corresponding to any point on the curve marked 20 would have an enel'o-y ratio of 5.
The nearly straight dotted lines running across the sheet diagonally correspond to various
constant lengths of exit cone, and they are marked with the ratio of length to diameter at the
small end.
To illustrate the use of ~his chart in choosing an exit cone a few illustrative examples will
be given.
1. A tUl1nel is to be 2 meters in diameter. In order to keep the size and cost of the building
within reasonable limits, it is desired that the length of the exit cone shall not exceed 20 meters.
ubject to this limitation, the cone is to be chosen for maximum efficiency.
The ratio of length to diameter here is 10. Passing along the dotted lin e bearing that
number, it is seen that it cuts the curve of 16 per cent loss at two points and that it does not cut
the 14 per cent curve at all, but that it approaches neare t to the latter at the point (a = 6. 0,
n=4.). It is u ually be t to make n a little smaller than the value for minimum loss in the
exit cone, a a r eduction in n is a reduction in the diameter at the large end of the cone and sc
in the propeller diameter , and it has already been shown that this is favorable to propeller
efficiency. It would probably be best, in this case, to take n=4.3, a=6 .1 °, or some other
combination in that immediate n eighborhood.
2. A very large tunnel i to be built, and, in order that the prop oller diameter may not be
umeasonably large, as ,,·ell as to keep down the height of the building, the propeller diameter is
limited to twice the diameter of the tunnel at the minimum section.
If the r atio of diameter at the ends of the exit cone is 2, n = 4. Drawing a vertical from
the cale of absci re at this point, it is seen that it approaches nearest to the 14 per cent curve
at (a=4.5° ). The length of the exit cone for this angle is 13 time the minimum diameter. It
would not be advisable, under these conditions, to choo e the cone for the ab olute maximum
of efficiency, as the length could be decrea eel 4t diameters at a co t of only 5 per cen t
increa e in the total power by increasing a to 6.JO., ince the curvature of tho constant

EXPERIMENTS ON MODEL WIND TUNNELS.

The fir L et of experiment conducted dealt "ith a model of the wind tunnel for Langle)
Field, as it WitS originally pl anned. The tunnel was of the Eiffel type, with a large experimental
cha lber, and this chamber was reprod uced to the proper calc in the model. All of the model
used were one-fifth the size of the large tunnel, the experimental chamber being 30.5 cm. in
diamet I' in the models. The entrance and exit cones were ma le of pIa tel' over a base of "allboard, and were hellaced, so that a very mooth urface was secured. The plaster "as craped
to form, a oon as it is et, with a steel template rotated about a 'haft running along the axis
of the tunnel. An exit cone is shown, w.ith the template in place ancll'eady to apply the plaster.

entrance cone, and at E, tru:ee-quarters of the way across the chamber, the velocity dropped off

in a smooth curve from very near the center of the stream out to far beyond its normal
boundarie .
The velocity distribu tion in the exi t cone was exceedingly strange. The veloci ty dropped 011
rapidly from a maximum at the center, so that the stream appears actually to con(,ract rather
than to expand in the exit cone. As in the entrance cone, there was another maximum ncar
the wall, but it was farther from the wall than was that at the entrance, and the velocity was
much lower than at the center. Directly in front of the propeller the vclocity at the center
dropped sharply, due to the hub, and varied in an irregular manner over the rest of the section.
The flow at thi p oint was so turbulent and so varying in direction that the measurements of
velocity may contain considerable errors.
In order to make direct observations on the sharpness of definition of the edge of the stream
in the experimental chamber and to determine the general nature of the flow in the chamber
un bserver got inside and sounded the flow with a thread. It wa evident that the air in the
whole chamber was much stirred up, and that the flow neal' the nominal edge of the stream was
extremely turbulent, except in the immediate neighborhood of the entrance. Even in the farthest corners of the chamber, at a distance from the center of the stream equal to more than
three times its nominal diameter, there was still a distinct movement of the air. The motion
everywhere was very unsteady, the direction of flow at a given point changing 60 ° or more
almost instantaneously. 'rhe best defined part of the circulation was ncar the small end of the
exit cone, where two strong vortices rotating in opposite directions existed in the corners of the
cha ber. The examination of the flow was not extended to points above and below the stream
in this neighborhood, so it is not certain whether or not a complete vortex ring, surrounding the
opening into the exit cone, existcd. The results of this examination of the flow in the experimental chn.mber made it clear that tho balanco woult.! have to be shielded in some way from tho
air currents if any accurate work was to be done. In Eiffel 's tunnel partial shielding of the
balance is accomplished by placing it on a platform which, however, extends across only a small
proportion of the width of tho room, and can hardly act as a complote protection from air-currcnts
for the measuring instruments.
The power curve is plotted in figure 14 (curve No.1) and the curve of speed agninst
revolutions per minute in figure 15 (curve No.1). The energy l'Iltio varied too little
and too irregularly to make it worth while to plot a curve.
Its mean value was 0.90,
making no allowance for propeller losses. If the propeller efficiency be a sumed to be 57 per
cent (the valud' calculated by the Drzewiecki method)) the energy ratio for the tunnel proper
becomes 1.58.
In view of the irregularities of flow found in the experimental chamber it was decided to try
next the effect of inclosing the stream in a cylindrical tube during its passage across the experimental chamber. J o attempt was made to make the tube air-tight, the static pressure inside
the tube being equal to that in the experimental chamber, which was carefully made air-tight.
Cur ve o. 2 in figure 14, and also in figure 15, correspond to this case, and the traverses of the
stream at points corresponding with those taken for the original model arc plotted in figure 16.
Comparing these traverses with those in figure 13 it is seen that the nature of the distributio in the entrance cone is practically unaffecteu. The velocity at point 0 was a little leSE
regular than for the case of the unconstrained strerun, showing an increase near the walls similar
to that which characterized the entrance cone. At D and E, however, the velocity was much
m re even with the inclosing t~be than without it, being constant within 1 per cent over 75
per cent of the diameter. Evidently, from the standpoint of steadiness of flow, the inclosed
type of tunnel is superior to the Eiffcl type.
In the exit cone tbe eiTect of surrounding the stream with a definite boundary was still more
apparent. At F the velocity three-quarters of the 'wny from the center to the walls was .94 per
cent of that at the center, as against 67 pel' Cl'l1t in the original model. At G the corresponding
figures were 82 per cent and 40 per cent. At II there was, as in the first case, a minimum at the
center and two maxima, the distribution of velocity being reasonably uniform across the outer
70 per cent of the blade, which is the most effective portion.

and the power consumption for n gi,en wind speed w'as decreased just about 50 per cent. The
energy ratio ,yjth the inclosing tube was 1.83 for the whole installation, or, malting due alluwance
for the propeller losses, 3.20 for the tunnel alone.

DESIGN OF WIND TUNNELS AND WIND TUNNEL PROPELLERS.

•

669

It is evident that the inclosure of the stream improves the results in every way. The results
obtained in these experiments, so far as power consumption is concerned, check very well with
those obtained in some similar experiments on model tunnels, carried out by Lieut. Castellazzi. 1
Lieut. Castellazzi found that the efficiency ,vas decreased 40 per cent by the usc of an open
experimental chamber. The experimental chnmber used in his experiments was round in cross
section and was twice as large in diameter as the entrance and exit cones where they entered the
chamber, and the slightly greater loss in efficiency found in the expel'imen ts conducted at
Langley Field may be accounted for by the larger size and more irregular form of the experimental
chamher there employed.
EFFECTS OF VARIATION IN EXIT CONE FORM.

The next series of experiments dealt with the effect of alterations in exit cone form. It
was originally the intention to make a number of cones of different forms, but this plan was
abandoned after two had been tried, and the experiments cover only the parabolic and straight
forms of cone . . These are a widely different from each other in respect of their acceleration curves
as are any two forms which would be likely to be used.
The curves of p : nver and revolutions pel' minute wjth the stl'aight cone are plottC'd as
curve No.3 in figures 14 and 15. The mean energy ratio is 1.88 for the cumhination of tunnel and
propeller, or 3.20 for the tunnel alone, ,alues identical with those for the parabolic cone. It
is evident from the curves that the effect 'Jf changing the exit cone from a parabolic to a straigh~
form was very slight. The parabolic form seems to have a slight advantage at high values of
VD and to be inferior at low values, but the difference between the two cur.es is in no case in
excess of the possible experimental error. In view of these results it appears that the efficiency
of a tumiel is not afl'ected appreciably by exit cone form or by the nature of the acceleration in
the cone, but only by its longth, mean angle, and total expansion ratio.
The large acceleration suddenly imposed on the air at the .iuncture between the paraIlelsided portion of the tunnel al1lI a straight exit cone might be expeeted to cause turbulence,
so that the now would be less regular than with a parabolic or other smoothly curving form.
No experimental data arc available on this point as yet, as the experiments were t('mpol'arily
hal ted by an accident to the propeller before traverses and investigations of the flow had been
carried out with the straight cone.
OBSERVATIONS OF THE NATURE OF THE FLOW THROUGH THE PROPELLER.

The most noticeable feature of the flow behind the propeller is the great rapidity with
which the slip stream spreads. Instead of contracting, as in t.he case of an airp!ane propell~r,
where the direction of inflow is unre3tricted, the stream expan'ds immediately on passing clear
of the cone, the air changing its direction so that there is a strong movement of the air, in a
direction approximately at right angles to the axis of the tunnel, at a distance of 30 cm. back
and 50 cm. out radially from tho edge of the exit cone.
The flow in tho throat and cones was ,ery steady at all points except near the edges of the
stream. The velocity head varied with a total amplitude of oscillation of about 2 per cent of
the head and a period of from 20 to 40 seconds. On passing the propeller the pulsations of
velocity became much more marked. The period of the pulsations close behind the propeller
was about half a second, and the maximum ,elocity was estimated to be about 50 per cent
greater than the minimum, although no means of measuring and making a continuous record of
a rapidly varying velocity were Il,\"ailable. On going farther away from the propeller along the
lines of flow of the air the pulsations steadily increased in \"iolence and the period lengthened
until, at a distance of about 80 cm. to the rear of the propeller, the flow consisted of a violent
gust about every second, the velocity in the intervals between these gusts being so low as to be
hardly perceptible. These observations on the nature of the flow and its variations held in a
general way for all the models tried, but tho pulsations of velocity were much more marked for
the case where the experimental chamber was left open than for that where it was inclosed in
a tube.

THE EFFECT OF DISKS AND SPIN ERS ON THE PROPELLER.

Tn order to sccmc some idea of the effect of enlarging the hub of a propeller or of attaching
a pinner, some experiments were made with disks of wall board attached in front of and behind
ller, and al 0 with a paper cone projecting from the propeller into the exit cone. The
the propB
results of these tests do not fairlS' represent what miO'ht be secured with a good spinner and a
propeller especially designed for it, as the propeller pitch should be increased when a spinner is
incorporated or the hub is enlarged, but they will give some idea of the effect.
The effect of placing a disk in front of the central portion of the propeller, the rear not being
covered and the blades not being housed in any way, was to decrease the wind speed and increa e
the power consumption. The inner parts of the blades acted as a centrifugal blower, taking air
in from the rear and throwing it out radially. The increase in powrr, with a clisk half the
diameter of the propeller, was 9 per cent, the decrease of speed with the same disk 19 per cent.
With n. disk only one-fifth the diameter of the propeller the speed was decreased 5 per cent.
These measurements were made at a speed of 10 meters per second and with the parabolic exit
cone. The relative loss by the addition of a di k was greater with the straight cone and at high
speeds, the adelition of a eli k four-tenths the diameter of the propeller causing an increase of 28
per cent in power an 1 a dccrease of 19 per cent in speed at a speed of 34 meters a second with the
straight exit cone. The energy ratio was decreased 59 per cent. All subsequent tcsts were
mad . with the straiO'ht cone, and the losses would probably be less with other forms.
The audition of another clisk of equal size behind the propeller, so preventing any flow in
from the rear and out toward the tips, improved the performance as compared with the single
di k in front of the propeller, but remained inferior to the original case with no shirlding at ail.
The power was increased only 6 per cent as compared with the original case without any uisks,
but the speed was decreased 16 per cent and the energy ratio fdl off 44 per cent. When the rear
clisk alone was in place, so that any air tht'own rauially outwaru had to come from inside the
exit cone, the power was increased 6 per cent, the velocity decreased 5 per cent, and the energy
ratio decreased 19 per cent, using the model without disks as a standard in all cases. The disk
behind the propeller therefore gave better results than did complete sheathing, either in the
form of disks or faired by a cone in front.
The aduition of a cone, having a diameter ellual to two-fifths the cliameter of the exit cone
at its large end and an altitude of one and a IIuarter times its own diameter, in front of the propeller decreased the power about 2 per cent and increased the speed 7 per cent as compared with
. the vcLlues for the disks alone, but the energy ratio was still 30 per cen t lower than for the original
case. It seems strange at first that the entire blocking off of n. considern.ble portion of the blades
hould increase the power consumption for a given number of revolutions per minute, but the
phenomenon can he accounted for by the higher air speed past the propeilrr when the area. of
the exit cone is constricted by enlarging the hub. The theory of the effect of an enlarged hub
or spinner has been discussed in another section of this report.
Jt appears that the addition of a spinner or the enlarO'ement of the hub caused serious loss
in every case where it was tried with the straight cone. The loss with a parabolic cone is much
less, fmd it is likely that, with a propeller properly designed to allow for the increased velocity
due to the blocking off of part of the area of the exit cone by the spinner, results as good as those
in the. original case could be obtained. It may even be that they could be ma terinlly improved
on, but this does not seem very probable in view of the uniformly poor results shown in these
experiments, where tho presence of the spinner can hardly have decreased the propeller efficiency
more than 10 per cent (a loss which, as already noted, could be prevented by the adoption of a
propeller clesigned especially for the new conditions), The loss inpropellr,refficiency, therefore,
would not be sufficient entirely to account for the decrease of energy ratio. The principal value
of a very large hub is to increase the power coefficient of the propeller and make possible the
reduction of the peripheral speed for a given wind speed.

THE CONSTRUCTION OF MODELS FOR TESTS IN WIND TUNNELS.
By F. IT.

NORTON .

INTRODUCTION.

I t is the general tendency of model makers, especially tho e who are u ed to working in
wood, to underestimate the accuracy required in the con truction of model. for wind tunnel
tests. In most pattern making an error of a hundredth of an inch is of no importance, but if
thi error occurs on an aerofoil, the model i valueless for testing pm·po es. The model maker,
however, is not alway to blame for the error in the model, for the e are often due to inaccm'acies
in laying out the drawing of the model to a small scale. Also models that are not of the proper
size or ,,"eight are difficult or impossible to test. For these reasons a large amount of time and
material has been wasted in constructing models, perhaps well finished, but unsuitable for
wind tunnel experiments. It i the purpose, therefore, of this report to describe the methods,
materials, and size that have been successfully used in this work.
TYPES OF M ODELS.

The type of model most tested in wind tunnel is the ingle aerofoil of tandard size, for the
pm·po e of determining the aerodynamic propertie of a certain section.
ingle wings are also
te ted wibh varying aspect ratio and plan form, and biplane and triplane combination arC
often tested without body or struts. The wings, whether tested alone or OIl a complete machine,
require the mo t careful reproduction of any part of an airplane. If the aerofoil is thin it
hould be constructed of a light aluminum alloy, as thin wooden wing~ will not hold their shape,
no matter how carefully made, and it i difficult to fa ten a pinelle into the end. Thick models
like strut and propeller sections, however, are best constructed of wood. Metal aerofoils should
be constructed to within 0.002 inch of the given ordinates, and wooden ones to 0.004 inch.
The angle of incidence hould not vary along the wing more than 0.1 of a degree, but a slight
curvatme along the span of the wing, giving an effect of dihedral or kathedral angle, does no
harm.
nless a wing is intended for a spe::ial test, u ::h as aspect ratio, it should alway be of
tandard size to insure strict comparison between different section . In 4-foot tunnels a
section 3 by 1 inches i used, and in larger tunnel corresponding sizes. Whenever possible the
wing should be held by an end spindle, threaded directly into the end of the wing if of metal,
one-third of the distance from the leading edge. (Fig. 1.) All standard aerofoils hould have
quare ·ends and an a pect ratio of 6.
Bodie , :float, and hulls are made of wood and need not be as accurately con tructed as aerofo ils. The maximum error, however, should be kept within 0.02 ineh on large models and
0.01 inch on small one~. The spindle is usually attached to the body by screwing it into the·
wood, the spindle being made with a wood crew point. If the model i bulky it should be
made of a light wood, hollowed out to reduce the weight, as every pound added to the model
means an addition of about 3 pound to the weight on the pivot point, for 2 pounds must be
added to the lower part of the balance in order to keep the center of gravity stationary.
A complete model should have a span of about 1 inches (not more than 21 inches) for a
4-foot tunnel, and weigh not more than 3 pounds. It must not, however, be lightened in sucb
a way as to cause deformations at high velocities. The wings should be correctly aligned in

MATERIALS.

The materials used in can tructing the e models should be light and capable of holding their
shape. Thin parts like strut and wings are be t constructed of metal, but the other parts are
usually made of wood. Wings can be made of pure aluminum, but thi material is rather oIL,
and better results are obtained by using a harder alloy havin a
better machining properties. Magne ium cuts ea ily ancl
smoothly and is considerably lighter than aluminum, but at
present is hard to ca t without blowholes. Perhap the be t
per cent
alloy for this pUTpO e is the very common one with
copper and 92 per cent aluminum. If it is de ircd to construct
a wing of great permanence for a standard, or for test at high
speed.s, it should be cut from teel, but this i at pre ent a

rather expen ive process. An aerofoil for pre sure distribution tests is best made of brass,
because of the necos ity of using solder. Wings of a more or less temporary character can
be made of plaster or wax as described later.
Wood to be u ed for thick wings and bodies should be well seasoned and clear. As the
expense for material is very small compared with labor expen e, only the highe t quality stock
should be con idered. The wood for aerofoil need not be light, but rather hard and cIo e
grained, such a maple, beech, boxwood, or holly. The maple i the easiest to procure and it is
quite satisfactory when the stock is selected.

The proee s of making a 3 by 1 inch aero foil will be described, the method, however,
applying to any size of wing. Thi proces has been ucces fully u ed for several years by Mr.
Edward Tighe, model maker for the Ma sachu ett Institute of Technology. It should be
r emembered that, although wood can be worked to a very thin section, it will not hold its shllpe

where any permanency is desired.
A I-inch board of well-seasoned maplo is cut along tho grain into narrow strips that are
planed t-inch wide. E,ory other strip is re,ersed and tOil t -inch strips placed together with
two face strips Hnch wide. This re,ersal of strips eliminates any tondency for tho blank

with beavy blocks on each side so that the total length "ill be und er e,en pressure. The blank
is left in the clamps for from 12 to 24 hours. It is then allowed to age for a few weeks to take
up any initial warp (fig. 4). AB the hardened glue, adhering to the faces of the blank quickly
dulls edge tools, it shadd be removed as far as possi1le with a glue scraper.
Both faces of the b1u.nk are now made fiat and parallel on a planer. It is of the utmost
importance in this work to keep all tools sharp, and the importance of always removing the
same amount of mate:'ial from the opposite fn. ces of a piece of stock should al a be empha ized,
for if thi is neglected the material ,,-ill n.lways curl toward the face from which the larger
amount of stock is remo,ed. When both faces aro true one edge is squared up on the planer
and the ends are trimmed off on the circular saw, malting the blank ready for cutting to the
desired section.
An accurate outline of the desired section is drawn with Indin. ink on white paper on a
15-inch or a 3D-inch cbord, using a medium fine line. This drawing is carefully stretched on a
board and photographed on a process plate to a 3-inch chord. If this negati\-e is printed on
contrast pn.per a fitle black line should result on a white background. The error in length of
the reduced section should not be more than half a hundredth of an inch, whi ch may require
se\-eral trials in focusing. The print is trimmed and fastened to the end of the blank, pref(Fig. 5.)
erably with ,egetable glue.
A saw table is set up with a. sharp, mther ,,-ide, rip saw, hollow ground but lIa,ing no set.
The trued edge of the blank is placed against the saw guide and a light cut is taken along one
face of the wing, and the depth is gradually increased until the saw ju t touches the black line
on the photographed section. The guide i
mo\""ed along about the width of the saw and the
cut repeated, with a proper depth to touch the
section at the new point. A magnifying glass
is useful to accurately gauge the depth of the
cut. After a few cuts haye been made in this
FIGURE 7.
manner the blank is turned o,er and the same
operation is repeuted on the back, in order to pre,ent warping. This process is continued until
all the wood has been remo,ed except a few ridges to support the 1Jlank on the saw table.
These ridges are now removed and the blank is ready for trimming. (Fig G.)
The ,~-itlg is held down to the bench by brads in the end and the irregular faces arc wedged
up in order to preyent strain as shown in figure 7. Tbe terraces left by the saw are carefully
planed down with a fine set plane until the groo,es just disappear. A convex plane is foquired
for conca,e surfaces, but should be sharp and set fine, as the maple may be somewhat crossgrained. The surface is next scraped ",,- ith steel or glass to take out any lumps, is rubbed down
with fine sandpaper, and the leadi ng and trailillg edges rounded off. After the ends of the
wing are squared off to the proper length, the surface is filled, gi,en two coats of shellac, and
rubbed down with pumice. (Fig. 8.)
If this work is clone ca.refully, the aerofoll "iil nowhere have an error of over 0.005 inch
and the an~rn.ge error will be much smaller. It should be noted that any number of \yillgs
of the same section may be cut from one photographic section by running several blank
through the saw at each setting, care being taken to ha,e the blanks of the same thick?ess.
WOODEN AEROFOILS OF VARYING SECTION.

Wings that do not ha,e a constant section are much more difficult to construct than the
usual type. They, m~ty, of course, be worked down by template in the same way as a propeller blade, but as thi is, at best, a rather long and inaccurate process, a special machine has
been developed for this purpose. The principle of this machine consists in guiding a revolving cutter along a preuetermined CUlTe by means of an adjustable template. A general ,iew
of the machine is shown in figures 9 and 10. An iron bed plate (a) is mounted on the cross
feed of an engine lathe, the oyerhanging ends steadied by guides (l[) which rest on the ,,7ays,
but allow the wing bed to be moved laterally and longitudinally in the same way as the tool

post. The wing blank (1) is screwed to the surface of this bed. A brass bar (b) is fastened
to the front of the bed plate, and carries 25 micrometer screws spaced 1 inch on centers. These
crew are i-inch. 40 threads, with a spherical top and a 50-tooth gear pinned to the lower end.

has the same radius of curvature as the cu tter radius (3-inch). A spring i-inch wide and

0.038-inch thick was found best suited for ordinary work. A frame (h), pivoted at (i), and
holding the ~-hoTSepower motor (f) allows the cutter (m) to move only in a vertical direction.
The cutter is made to follow the curve of the spring by the guide (d), which rests lightly on
it. This is adjusted vertically by the screw (e) for cutting wings of uniform section (when
the spring is horizontal) and for setting the cutter to the proper height after sharpening. For
cutting wood a two-bladed cutter i -inch wide is driven at 5,000 revolutions per minute by
a belt directly from the motor.
The material best suited for making models that are tested soon after completion, just as in
the case of thick wings of uniform section, is laminated maple, and the blanks are made up in
the way described for such wings in the preceding section of this report.

FIGUBEl6.

The blank is screwed down to the base plate with 5 machine screws and the back is cut
by starting i inch from the leading edge of the blank and taking a cut across with the micrometer
screws set for the first row of ordinates. The wing is moved laterally to the next position,
and another cut taken. (Fig. 12.) This is repeated until the whole surface is cut. Three or
four ridges should be left on the back of the wing in order to support it evenly when cutting the
other face; also a groove should be cut for the spindle. The blank is then turned over and cut
in the same manner on the other side. The surface is then an even set of terraces (photographs
of the blank in this condition are shown in figs. 13 and 14).
A wing of constant section is made ·in the same way except that the steel spring is kep t
horizontally on the bedplate and the cutter is adjusted in height by the screw (e). This
required only one-twentieth of the settings used by the varying section wings.
Figures 15 and 16 show an attachment for cutting wings with a varying chord and straight
lines from an ordinate at the center section to a corresponding ordinate at the tip. The guide

rests on the straight bar (c), as only one-half of the wing can be cut at a time. The blank is
screwed to the pivoted ba e plate (b) swinging about its axis (h). It will be noticed that the
intersection of the leading and trailing edges prolonged (i) is opposite the hinge (g). With
this arrangement it is only necessary to set the ordinates for the mean chord, as the others
are automatically obtained from these by swinging the tip of the wing in the opposite direction
from the movement of the cross slide when setting the cutter for the mean chord. The scale
(e) is used to determine this distance. Wings having curved contours and tapering plan form
can also be cut., but require a large amount of computation.
When the section is completed on the machine,
the ends are trimmed off, allowing a little extra length
to prevent rounding off the corners. The wing is
clamped down on a block of wood and the terraces
are planed down as described before. The plane
used for this purpose should be small enough not to
cover up the part worked on. The plane can be
ground concave or convex to fit irregular surfaces.
FIGURE 17.
The surfaces are then finished in the manner already
described for wings of uniform section. The spindle is now screwed on, and any holes or errors
in cutting are filled up with beeswax. (Fig. 17.) This may sound like a rather long and
complicated process, but a wing can be cut and finished in 6 to hours, a shorter time than
that usually required to work out the ordinates.
The ordinates for these wings can be scaled off from a drawing on a 30-inch chord to the
nearest one-hundredth inch which gives the ordinates for the model to a thousandth inch.
As this is a rather long process, it is best wherever possible to make a single drawing and to
proportion the ordinates of all sections to this with a slide rule.
The advantage of this machine is that it cuts a wing from the ordinates and requires no
smaU scale drawings or templates. The machine described was designed to cut wooden aerofoils, but there is no reason why a stiffer and heavier machine could not be used to accurately
cut aluminum or steel wings of either constant or varying section.
METAL AERO FOILS.

---

The majority of aerofoils are best constructed of
aluminum and very satisfactory ones have been made of
this material by the following method. Steel templates
are made to fit the upper and lower surfaces, from onesixteenth inch tool steel worked by hand to within 0.001
FIGURE 18.
inch of the given contour. The two halves are fitted
together as shown in figure 18. It is well to check the dimensions of the templates on a
dividing engine before proceeding further. A block of aluminum, preferably rolled stock, is
trued up on one side to a plane surface. This surface is then clamped down to the bed of a
small planer, and the upper surface is planed down to within about a hundredth of an inch of
the finished size of the wing. The upper surface is now worked down by hand with file and
scra,p er, using the plane surface as a reference, until it everywhere fits the template. This
must be done very carefully by a skilled workman, and requires considerable time (from 30
to 100 hours). The lower surface is now worked down to fit the second template, using the
upper template as a reference. In this way the wing is made straight and of uniform thickness.
The ends of the wing are milled off square, and one end is drilled and tapped for spindle.
This method should give a wing that is everywhere within 0.002 inch of the given dimensions.
Another method, applying mainly to brass and steel wings, makes use of a milling machine
in the following manner: A slab of rolled brass or steel is trued up on one face and soldered
to n trued heavy block that is fastened on the bed of a milling machine. The cutter is set

679

CONSTRUCTION OF MODELS FOR TESTS IN WIND TUNNELS.

down until it just touches the lower block, and the edge of the wing blank is squared off. The
cutter is now moved inward 0.05 inch and raised an amount determined by a table of ordinates .
for the section. These ordinates are scaled off of a drawing to 10 times scale in the same way as
for the wooden sections. A series of cuts are taken across the wing until the upper surface is
completely formed, leaving two narrow ridges to determine the original surface. The blank
is unsoldered from the lower block, and the cut surface is filled with solder or lead and fastened
down to the block, with the other face up, taking care that the ridges on the cut surface are in
firm contact with the block. The squared edge of the blank is now lined up carefully with
the milling machine ways, and the second surface is cut in the same manner as the first. Alter
unsoldering the wing from the block all possible solder is wiped off, and the blank is ready
for finishing. This is done by filing down the telTaces until the grooves have just disappeared,
which should leave a smooth and accurate surface. This method requires no templates nor
as much skill as the preceding one, but is considered unsuitable for aluminum wings, as this
metal does not hold solder, nor can it be machined to the finished size without the danger of
tearing.
Brass wings can be cut with a one-toothed formed cutter, but it does not pay to make a
cutter unless several wings of the same section are to be made. It is also rather difficult to
get a smooth surface with this type of cutter.

FIGURE 19.

FIGURE 20.

FIGURE 21.

AB the wind speed in which aerofoils are tested is increased beyond 100 miles an hour
it is necessary to use steel for models in order to prevent excessive deflection of the wing.
Although it has apparently never been tried, it is probable that some method could be devised
for machine grinding steel wings on a surface grinder to a high degree of accuracy.
OTHER METHODS OF MAKING AEROFOlLS.

It is sometimes convenient to make aeroifols up in a quicker and less permanent manner,
when they are to be used only for one test soon after construction. It is also desirable to be able
easily to make a small change in some particular region of the wing without making a new model.
The following methods have been used successfully here and abroad, but can probably be
improved on by more extensive use.
The following method is used for making complete aerofoils. Two channel-shaped metal
flasks, with upper edges machined are fitted together with dowel pins, as shown in figure 19.
Two accurate templates (positive) are made to the sectional form of the wing, with lugs at the
end to fit on the flask and guides to keep it square. (See fig . 20.) The flasks are now filled with
well-calcined plaster nf Paris that has been mixed into a rather thick paste. The templates are
used as scrapers to roughly form the wet pbster to shape. Alter the plaster has set, the templates can be used to finish the molds down to the correct size. A very good finish can be obtained in this way, but the final finish should not be given until the plaster is dry or the shrinkage
may distort the molds. The surfaces are now painted with linseed oil and the flask is clamped
together. One end is plugged and a spindle held in the correct position. The spindle may well
run completely through the wing as reenforcement. The mold may now be filled at the top with

680

ANNUAL REPORT NATIO.r AL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

a thin mi..~ture of plaster or by some melted wax which possesses considerable hardness and
strength when cool. After the mixture is set the wing is removed and the upper end trimmed
off to the proper length. 1£ carefully made the model should have a good fini h and be, initially atl cast, quite accurate. The wing will not be very permanent and should be tested soon
after completion. Also it will not possess sufficient trength to make it available for tests at high
speeds.
Another method of making plaster wings lias been devised by the Curtiss Co. An iron bed
having two trued ways (fig. 21) is nearly :filled with a mixture of paraffin and Montan wax.
When cold the wax is scraped down with a positive steel template to fit one surface of the wing.
Th . template is carried on a carriage and can be gradually lowered as shown in figure 22. When
this surface is completed a thin layer of wet plaster is spread on the wax and a sheet-steel core
s pushed down to correspond with about the center of the wing, more plaster is added to the top,
and is allowed to set. Before it becomes completely hard the template for the other surface is
fastened in the carriage and the plaster is scraped down to size, the template being set to give
the correct thickness. These wings can be made quite thin, but are not strong and must be
ha dled with great care, and it is' necces ary to support them with a center spindle.
When it is desired to make a series of changes in only one face of the aerofoil, it can be most
conveniently done by taking a metal wing having the desired permanent surface, and with the
other surface cut below any desired change on this part.
egative templates are made of thin
sheet metal for all the desired forms, cut to slide over the leading and trailing edges, as shown in
figure 23. The wing is placed in a shallow trough that fits the plan form of the wing and enough
melted beeswax is poured over the desired surface to :fill it above any desired contour. When the

FIGURE 22.

FIGURE 23.

wax has fully cooled it ean be scraped down to the required size by template. The template may
be held by hand, but a more satisfactory job can be done by holding it in a milling machine and
running the model under it. In this way a very excellent surface can be formed equal in accuracy
and finish to a wooden one. The wing must be tested within a few hours of the time it is scraped
in rder to be sure that the wax does not deform. The same method can be used with plasticine,
but this material does not give as good results as the wax.
BODIES AND HULLS.

The construction of bodies and hulls requires less accuracy than wings, so that it will be
necessary merely to outline the gen ral methods used in their making. Large models should be
cut to 0.02 inch and small ones to 0.01 inch of the given dimensions. For a 4-foot tunnel, no
body should be more than 36 inches long nor 5 inches in diameter nor weigh more than 2 pounds,
so that it is necessary to hollow all large models. The best woods to use for these models is white
pine or bay mahogany, woods that are light, easy to work, and not liable to warp.
mall bodies may be made of one piece sawed out to the correct profile in two planes, as
sh wn in figures 24 and 25. The edges cut off in the first sawing are lightly bradded on to the
body in order to steady it when sawing the second side. The four sides are then planed down
accurately to size, and by the aid of templates the corners are worked off with plane or spokeshave. The surface is then scraped and finished with shellac rubbed down with pumice and oil.
1£ a fuselage has a spinner on the nose, it is best to turn this part down separately on a lathe and
d weI it on to the fuselage, working the squared block down to the spinner. Cockpits should be
cut to at least half the depth of the body, but no details inside, such as the seat, need be included.

Wind shields, however, should be put in place and knobs representing the men's heads fastened
to the rear of the cockpit.
Large bodies (over 18 inches long and 2! inches in diameter) should be made hollow. This
is best accomplished by cutting out a series of lifts from thin stock Ci inch). These are sawed
out and planed accurately to outline and the whole set glued together with hot glue, being held
in alignment by dowel pins on the
base plate as shown in figure 26.
When the glue is hard the pins can ,
be cut off flush and the outside
surface of the model planed down
smoothly to the contour lines of
the lifts. This method gives a light
and accurate model requiring few
templates for finishing. A line
should always be marked on the
side of the body parallel with the
FIGURE 26.
propeller axis, in order to aid in
lining up the model.
Flying boat hulls and seaplane floats are constructed in the same way and require no special
comment.

c

ST ABILIZERS.

Stabilizers can be worked out of aluminum in the same way as aerofoils and require the
same degree of accuracy. If the stabilizer is thin it will not be too heavy if made of brass,
which is preferable to aluminum in everything except weight.
It is important that the stablizer may be easily and accurately adjusted for angle of incidence.
A maximum adjustment of 5 degrees is sufficient, but all mechanism for the adjustment must
be in the body that it may not disturb the air flow. It is also desirable to have both halves of
the stabilizer turn together.
A satisfactory and simple method is shown in figure 27. The two halves of the stabilizer
are mortised out and fitted in to the sides of the brass cylinder (a) with brass pins (b) all filed

flush with the stabilizer surface. 'fhe brass cylinder is ~ friction fit in the split r~g (c) screwed
into the wood of the body.
In figure 28 a similar arrangement is used except that a finer and more positive adjustmen~
is assured by the two adjusting screws (a) passing frQm the bottom of the body to the sides of
the brass cylinder (b). Figure 29 shows a way of adjusting a stabilizer that rests on the' top
longerons. A grooved brasss plate (a) is set in the top of the body, and a rocker on the lower
side of the stabilizer rests on it. The angle is changed by adjusting screws at (c) arid (d).
Another method, figure 30, has the stabilizer hinged at (a) and the upper edge is held up against
the screws (b) by springs. By adjusting these screws the angle is changed.

682

A template should be provided with every model to fit the stabilizer in order to line it up.
The .back of the template should be parallel to the stabilizer cord.
CONTROL SURFACES.

If it is desired to use the model for stability work, the aileron, elevator, and rudder are
made movable. The simplest and most satisfactory w,ay to accomplish this is to cut the surfaces

with a very fine jeweler's saw, beveling the inside edges and inserting several pieces of soft
bras" wire as dowel pins. This allows the surface to be held in any position without danger
of its turning. The size of the wires and their pacing depend, of course, on the size of the mod~
and the velocity at which it is tested. (Fig. 31.)
CHASSIS.

The wheels when small may be turned out of solid maple, but if the wheel is to be tested
alone, and is therefore large, it should be glued up of pine laminations and left hollow. The
lam' ations are sawed out roughly on the band saw, glued together,
and then the whole is turned up and polished on a lathe. A cross
section of such a wheel is shown in figure 32. The spindle is attached
to the center of the
wheel by screwing

the same way.
mall struts are made of metal, u ually brass, in the following way, if great accuracy is desired.
A rectangular trip of brass just large enough to contain the strut section is soldered to a heavy
block of metal, and is lined up truly on the miller bed. A serie of cuts are now taken along
'the strut with the corner of the cutter just touching the contour of the section, inscribed on
the end, leaving a hort uncut section at the other end in order to hold the strut squ are
when this side is soldered to the block. The cut surface while still on the block is carefully
:filed down until the cutter marks have just disappeared, leaving the surface smooth and true.
The strut is turned over and the operation repeated on the other side. If this is carefully done,

CONSTRUCTION OF MODELS FOR TESTS IN WIND TUNNELS.

683

an accurate strut will result, but if greater precision is desired the cutter may be set by the
micrometer head to a given set of orq.inates, in the same way used in cutting aerofoils.
The axle is usually made like a strut and the wheels are pinned to the ends. Shock
absorbers are fastened to the axle just inside the wheels with pins or glue, and are of stream-line
form in most models . (Fig. 33.) Where the shock absorber on the full-sized machine is
unstreamlined it may be reproduced on the model by winding a hard cord or wire of suitable
size about the axle.
RADIATORS.

Although radiators are usuaJly constructed of a solid block of wood, or are omitted altogether, there is no reason why this important portion of the structure should not be represented
with fair exactness. This is accomplished by u ing a fine gauze screen, or, better, a perforated
brass plate having the same resistance in proportion to a flat plate of the same size as has the
full-sized radiator. In order to get the proper resistance the radiator and flat plate of the same
size are mounted on opposite sides of a freely turning spinelle, but at such a distance as gives a
balance when the proper resistance of the radiator is reached. A short dummy spinelle must
be provided to counter balance the greater length of the spindle attached to the radiator. The
holes in the radiator are gradually enlarged until it balances the plate. A model J N 4H radiator
is shown in figure 34, mounted for balancing. The ratio of resistances between the radiator, and
a flat plate of the same size ranges roughly from one-half to two-thirds, depending on the type
of the radiator. A nose radiator should have a motor behind it and an outlet for the air in
accordance with the large machine. A I-Iispano Suiza motor and radiator model is shown in
figure 35.
THE COMPLETE MACHINE.

The completeness with which the minor parts of the aiJ:plane are reproduced on the model
depends largely on the purpose for which it is tested. For instance, should the model be used
only for determining the balance of the machine and the stabilizer setting, all small parts may
be omitted, as they will not affect the balance appreciably. If, however, the model is used to
(letermine the performance of the full-sized machine, or to obtain scale corrections, such parts
as exhaust stacks, control arms, shock absorbers, etc., should be attached. To have strict
agreement with the full-sized machine, wires and fittings, which furnish a large portion of the
total drag, should be placed on the model, but, because of the difficulty of reproducing the
wires and fittings on sm~ll models; and because the small wires do not have a resistence proportional to their size, wires have been omitted on practically all models. With a tractortype radiator, the passage for the air to escape around the engine should be of the same proportions as in the full-sized machine. It would be very desirable to employ much larger models
than are used now in order that all details might be included. With a 6-foot model it should
be possible to very closely determine the performance of any new machine.
The wings of the model should be made of aluminum or steel by the methods described
above, but usually with such a chord as to make the model some definite scale of the full-sized
machine. The size of the model should be proportioned to the size of the tunnel, and the weigh t
should be kept as low as possible consistent with stiffness at the maximum speed at which
the model is to be run. Care should be taken on every part of the model to insure accuracy,
finish, and sufficient strength to allow of handling.
When the wings are cut to the proper section, the plan form of the wing is laid out on the
lower surface of each, with a fine scratched line. The outline is sawed roughly to size and then
filed squarely to the line. By the aid of templates the ends are rounded off in the corr ect
maImer and carried smoothly into the finished surface of the wing. Wings having dihedral
r;:an be cut three-fourths through at the center section with a fine saw and the wing bent to
the proper angle by means of templates. Sweep back, if present, is best accommodated by
cutting the wing in the center to the propel' angle on the milling machine and halving the pieces
together, as shown in figure 36. The point of attachment of the struts is marked on the upp er
surface of each wing, and by means of tapered blocks the strut holes are bored and tapped.

(Fig. 37.) It is important that the direction of the holes be tapped exactly in the direction
of the strut or it will be impossible to line the machine up closely. Also the threads in one
wing should be right-handed and in the other left-handed. Another method of fastening
interplane struts is to thread the ends of the struts and drill the wing, holding the struts to the
wing with countersunk nuts, as shown in figure 38. This allows the use of stream-line struts,
but they must be cut correctly to length as little adjustment can be made after assembly.

FIGURE 37.

FIGU&E 36.

FIGURE 38.

Intel'plane struts having no incidence wires on the full-sized machine, as in the portal, I or K
trusses, are made of a single piece of brass on the model and formed accurately to fit the surfaces
of the wing. They are fastened with flat-headed screws passing through the wing, as shown
in figure 39. This completes the work on the single wings.
The chassis is fastened to the body, either by pinning the struts into the body with pins
that are continuations of the struts, or by bending the struts sharply as they meet the body
so that the face of the strut is parallel with the side of the body and is mortised in flush with
the surface and held by a small wood screw. If the lower wing passes through the body, as is
geD rally the case, an accurate section of the wing is marked on the body, and with a fine band

saw the wood inside this section is cut away, with an entrance cut at the trailing edge. The
lower wing can be slipped into this opening and screwed firmly in place by two wood screws
inse' ted from below. Should the wing pass below the body, it can be held by long, slender
wood screws passing through the wing into the body. The wing is held away from the body
the correct distance by stream-lined spacers, as shown in figure 40.
The empennage is attached to the body, the leading edge of the stabilizer square with
the axis of the body, and the fin and rudder parallel with the line of flight. The tail skid is
uSUiLllj made from the same piece of metal as the fin.
The body struts to the upper wing are attached in the same way as the chassis struts and
are held at the other end by machine screws passing through the wing into the upper end of
the strut. The interplane struts are made of a piece of steel wire cut to the right length and
threaded on the ends with left and right threads. It is stream-lined when in place by a brass
fairing.
The model is now ready for lining up , a process that must be done with the greatest care,
in order that it may be relatively as well lined as the full-sized machine. In order to do this
the fuselage is clamped securely to a plane surface, right side up and with the propeller axis

horizontal. A pair of similar templates are now made that will go under the chord of the
upper and lower wings on either side of the body in such a way as to :fix the angle of incidence
of each, their stagger and dihedral. The position of these templates is shown in figure 4l.
The interplane struts are now put in place and approximately adjusted, and the lower plane
is set to its correct angle of incidence by shimming where it passes through the body. With
the aid of the templates the upper wing is adjusted by turning the struts, the opposite threads
on which enable them to act as turnbuckles, until the wings are correct in all ways. The

F IGUR E 41.

brass fairings can now be attached with a soldering iron. They should aU be lined up along
the axis of the body. It is weU to check up the alignment of the . machine after mounting it
on the balance in order to be sure that there is no error of more than one-tenth degree at
any point.
The spindle is sometimes attached by screwing it directly into the wood of the body, but if
the model is to be used several times a metal socket is best inserted in the wood, as shown in
figure 42. This type of spindle, however, is rather unsatisfactory aerodynamically because of
its interference with the wings and because it is difficult to determine its effective resistance;
that is, the resistance which should be subtracted from the total resistance to give the true
resistance of the machine. A better way is to screw the spindle into the tip of the wing. If
the forces are large, it is necessary to insert a steel socket into aluminum wings. (Fig. 43.)

AEROFOILS FOR PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION.

It is sometimes necessary to know the pressure on each portion of the surface of an
aerofoil in order to determine the manner of loading. In order to do this a large number of
small holes are bored into the wing at right angles to the surface and each in turn connected
to a pressure gauge. As this requires a long time and the connections must not be allowed to
interfere with the air flow, the following methods have been adopted:
A method devised by the ational Physical Laboratory consists in cutting a series of
grooves along each surface of a brass wing at right angles to the chord. They are about h
inch wide and deep, and are spaced closest together where the pressure gradient is steepest,
but 10 or 12 rows is sufficient to each surface. A piece of -h-inch steel hypodermic tube in
each groove and smoothed off flush with the surface with solder. (Fig. 44.) A series of holes

are now bored along the tubes, on half the span only, as the wing is symmetrical. These holes
should be spaced nearer together at the wing tip than at the center. They should be bored
with a o. 70 drill and all burr carefully removed. The tubes should project about i inch
beyond the wing tip on the side away from the holes in order to make connections with rubber
tubs and yet not interfere with the air flow on the side where the pressure is being taken.
(Fig. 45.) The other ends of the tube are filed flu h with the surface, but are left open, so that
a cleaning 'wire may be pu hed tluough the tube. The wing is placed in the tunnel, and each
row of holes is connected to a tube of a multiple manometer. Every hole in each row must
be closed except one, which is open to the manometer. This can be done with plasticine, but as

FIGURE 45.

FIGURE 44.

this material is rather difficult to remove better results are obtained by using beeswax melted into
the holes with an electric soldering iron. The iron must be kept at the proper temperature
to . sure good results, f0r if it is too cold the wax will not clos the holes tightly, and if it is

can be forced through the tubes to clear them. The holes can also be seal d by small disks
of tissue covered with shellac. Care should be taken at each change of holes, to be sure that
each hole that should be open is clear and that all the others are closed. This is casily determined
by blowing against the wing at each hole with a small rubber tube and watching the manometer.
There should be no deflection except at the open holes.
Another method devised in this country, although requiring a little more work on the model,
has the advantage that it can be used on thinner sections, as ailerons and tail surfaces, and
gives moother surfaces. Two blocks of brass about
inch thick and of sufficient size .to construct the
wing, are trued up on one face. These faces are then
grooved at corresponding distances along the span

under each row of holes. The grooves can be cut
wit any cutter that will give a square or circular hole when the two halves are placed together.
Tho block are carefully tinned and are soldered face to face with -fi-inch aluminum wires in the
gro ve to prevent the solder filling them. The wire can be removed, leaving a series of clear air
passRges. Holes are now bored through the wing from face to face with a o. 70 drill, as shown
in figure 46. The direction of the holes hould be closely normal to the finished surface of
the wing. The block can now be placed in the milling machine and worked down as de cribed

When it is desired to investigate the pre sure on a control urface the holes and passages
are made in t.he same way, but it i~ now impo sible to take off the pressure on the ide of the
machine opposite from that on which the pressure is measured. In order to reduce the interference to a minimum, fine steel hypodermic tubes are carried out several inches from the
end of the wing before the rubber tube is attached. as shown in figure 47 .

MODEL PROPELLERS.

Model propellers are so similar to full-sized ones that the same methods of construction
apply to both. The method most generally employed consists in making a series of templates
to fit both upper and lower surfaces of the blade at a series of stations along the radius, The
position of these templates should be fixed by screwing them to a plate squarely and with
their proper spacing. This allows aU the templates to be applied to one face at' a time. A
series of laminations is glued to the proper thickness and cut out to the given contour. The
blades are then worked down by hand to fit the templates, a rather slow and inaccurate
method, but the best that has been used.
Another method consists in gluing up laminations that have first been cut to the exact
size. The blades are then trimmed down to the contour lines, thus determining the blade.
It is difficult to accurately cut the tip of the blade in this way, as the distance between
aminations is large in this region.
All model propellers are laminated to prevent warping, the best woods being pine or
mahogany, unless the blade has any thin sections, when a closer-grained wood like maple is
better. A four-bladed propeller should have each pair of laminations halved together rather
than to halve the whole propeller, in order to give a more uniform support to the blade.
Each propeller should be carefully balanced and finished with shellac. A steel hub can be
bolted to the propeller in the usual way. From the aerodynamic standpoint, it is desirable
that the full-sized propeller and the model be made from the same material and by the same
method, as the deformations of the blades of the two at like peripheral speeds should then
be identical.

REPORT No. 75.
THE AERODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF THICK AERO FOILS SUITABLE FOR INTERNAL
BRACING.
By F. H.

NORTON.

INTRODUCTION.

The object of this investigation is the determination of the characteristics of various
typ es of wings having sufficient depth to entirely inclose the wing bracing, and also to provide
data for the further design of such sections. This type of wing is of interest-first, because
it eliminates the resistance of the interplane bracing, a portion of the airplane that sometimes
absol'bs one-quarter of the total power required to fly; second, because it simplifies the construction and assembly of the wing structure, and, third, because these wings may be made to give
a very high maximum lift. At the present time, thick internally braced sections are used
with considerable success on several German machines, notably the Fokker and Junker
biplanes. This type of wing was not original with the Germans, however, for an Antoinette
monoplane was built and flown in France about 1910, which was entirely braced from inside
the wing section. 'rhis wing was flat bottomed and had a maximum hie ratio of one-sixth.
It was intended to investigate the following subjects:
1. Effect of changing the upper and lower camber of thick aerofoils of uniform section.
2. Effect of thickening the center and thinning the tips of a thin aerofoil.
3. EiIect of adding a convex lower surface to a tapered section .
4. Effect of changing the mean thickness with constant center and tip sections.
5. Effect of varying the chord along the span.
6. Effect of varying the thickness and chord in a more complex manner.
The last subject. is not yet completed and will be treated later.
All the sections in this test unless otherwise stated are square ended 3 by 18 inch models,
. tested with an end spindle at 30 M. P. H. and are comparable with the tests of the U. S. A.
• sections. Lc and Dc are in pounds per square foot and M. P. H. units, and the center of pressure
~ is given in fractions of the chord from the leading edge.
'rhe results have a precision of about
1 per cent.
TruCK CONSTANT SECTION WINGS.

The Durand 13 section gave such an unusually high maximum lift that some slight changes
were made in the upper camber to determine its best form and height. The surfaces were
made of wax, scraped to size as described in report No. 74. As some of these sections were
tested by studen ts and the ordinates were not as accurately produced as in the later sections,
the results of the runs are not plotted here. (See the bulletin of the Experimental Department
Airplane E gineering Division, December, 1918.) They are sufficiently precise, however, to
warrant general conclusions. E xcept for the higher and more stable maximum lift, these
sections gave results that are in agreement with the N. P. L tests on varying the upper and
lower camber.
On thick sections the maximum ordinate must be kept closely to one-third of the chord
from the leading edge. Moving it farther back gives a flatter, but lower burble point, while
moving it forward gives a lower and very unstable lift curve. With the maximum ordinate

one-third of the chord from the leading edge and a section similar to the Durand 13, the highest
m ax imum lift is r eached when the greatest thickness is about 0.477 inch on a 3··inch chord.
Beyond this height, the lift curve is unstable and decreases with increase in camber . A section
was tried with a thin trailing edge, but there was no improvement and the lift cmV(l had a very
bad break in it. The Durand 13 section was also tested with a Constantin type of Lading edge.
The lift increased rapidly to about 10°, then slowly to about 30°. The maximum Lc and the
maximum L ID were not improved, however, with this change. It seems evident that the
best upper camber has a maximum height of about 0.477 inchon a 3-inch chord, one-third of the
way from the leading edge, giving a maximum Lc of about 0.00400 and a maximum LID of 13 .

The lower surface has less effect on the aerofoil than the upper. As this surface is made
more convex the lift and the drag decrease until a minimum drag is reached when the section
is symmetrical. The minimum drag also moves to lower angles as the lower sUl'face is made
more convex. The maximum L ID is not affected by small changes in the lower surface, but
the L ID at low angles is improved by a small convex camber. One section with a concave
lower surface was interesting, in that it showed a positive, but unstable, lift at - 40° incidence.
Its maximum value for L c was 0.00422. Several other irregular lower mfaces were tried, but
showed no great improvement over the flat lower smface.

AERODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF THICK AERO FOILS.

The best flat bottomed section (used as the master section, Fig. 3) seems to be No. 16, whic1
has an hie ratio of 0.158, a maximum Lc of (0.00392), and a maximum LID of (13.1). The
lif t, drag, and L ID for this section are plotted on Plot 1 and the C. P. movement on Plot 2.
To illustrate the decrcase in wing area allowed by using this wing section, we may take as an
example a high-powered machine weighing 4,000 pounds and having a wing area (R. A. F. 15
section) of 450 square feet, a loading of about 9 pounds per square foot. To have the same
landing speed an area of 300 square feet would be sufficient with the No. 16 section.
These wings of deep constant section are satisfactory in respect to spar room and maximum lift, but the LID is about 20 per cent lower than for the wings used at present.

THE EFFECT OF TIDCKENING THE CENTER OF A TIDN WING.

The object of this test is to determine the effects of thickening the center of the span, and
thinning the tips, of a standard type of section. AU sections through these wings, perpendicular
to the leading edge, are similar to a master section, a modified Durand 13 (Fig. 3). All ordinates
were obtained by reducing from the corresponding ordinate of the master section in the same
proportion as the maximum ordinate is reduced by a smooth curve from the center to tp.e tip
of the wing. This curve is nearly parabolic with its vertex at the center of the span. All
sections were made fiat bottomed for ease in cutting. There are two series, No. 40-No. 43,
where the section at the tip has a chord to depth ratio 13, and the center of the span is thickened
successively, and No.44-Xo. 46 where the tip has n chord to depth ratio of 25 and the center
is successively thickened in the same way except Ihat the deepest section is omitted because
of its obvious unsuitability as shown by No. 43. The center of the pressure travel was no t
plotted for sections No. 44- o. 46 because it wa Ithought that nothing of interes t would be
shown. The models were constructed of maple, 3 by 1 inches and were within 0.005 inch
of the ordinates~given in the following tables. Lc and Dc (Plots 4 and 5) and LjD (Plots:6_and

sharp break was made, as a fairer representation than a smooth curve. On Plot the LID

cmax.
sections. A fast machine must fly at 2 to 3 times its minimum speed so that a high speed
wing must have a high L ID at one-fourth to one-ninth of the maximum Lc. The center of
pressure travel for sections No. 40- J o. 43 is plotted in the usual manner (Plot 9) . Figure 3

to seale, they are not intended as accurate representations of the wings, but simply to show
the relati,e shape of the sections.
The foUo,ving facts are evident from the curves:
Lift.-As the wing is thickened in the center, the lift curve shifts to the left and the maximum lift increases until hie in the center of about 0.15 is reached, after which the flow is unstable
and the maximum rapidly decreases. Thinning the tips shifts the lift curve toward the right,

maxi.mum is unchanged. Sections No. 42 and No. 45 show quite a high maximum, 0.00378
and 0.00345 as compared with 0.00258 for the constant section wing (No. 40). Sec ~ions Ko. 42
and No. 43 show a break in the air flow that is common in many tlllck sections. At certain
angles of incidence there may be two or even more types of flow. Tllls condition is somewhat
analogous to a supersaturated solution, as a given type of flow can be carried beyond its normal
point of breaking if the angle of incidence is changed slowly and carefully, but if jarred or left
for a considerable time will revert to its stable value. Tllls instability is lessened fLnd in some
cases disappears with an increase in velocity to 40 M. P . H. Tllls instability of flow is also
associated with aspect ratio, for even the R. A. F. () shows a break in the lift curve at vet'] low
aspect ratios.

Drag.-The minimum drag decreases with the thickness of the center section, reaching
the rather low value of 0.0048 for No . 44. The thinner sections, however, show a pronounced
increase in drag at high angles, 14° to 20°, in fact, exceeding the ch'ag of the thicker wings.
Thinning the tips decr eases the ch'ag at all anglee.
LI D.-The LID increases at all angles as the wing is thinned down. With r eference to
Plol, - the thickest wing, No. 43, gives a comparatively poor performance, while the thinnest,
No . 44, is shown .to be most excellent in this respect; the other sections falling botween them.
The max. L ID ranges from 13 to 18.2, increasing progressively as the wing is thinned.
Genter oj pressure.-The center of pressure travel becomes less, and the C. P . is slightly
farther to the rear as the tlllckness is increased. The travel on No. 40 lies 28 per cent from
the leading edge at 12° and 51 per cent at 0° wlllie on No. 43 it moves, between the same angles,
fro 35 to 47 per cent.

The following facts are evident from this test:
Lift.-The lift is everywhere decreased as the section is thinned and all the sections show a
flat burble point. The lift does not decrease as rapidly as the thickness, 'for the lift is approaching the limiting value of a flat plate. (Plot 18.)

Dmg.- The drag at low angles decreases with the thiclmess, but less rapidly as the wing
becomes thinner. It is interesting to notice that above 12° the thicker wing has the least

WINGS WITH VARYI NG CHORD.

T he wind tunnel investigations of wings that have a chord which v aries along the span is
a rather difficult problem, because of the great alteration in the properties of similar aerofoils,
when the chord is ch anged. It seems evident, at least with thick sections, that the chord can
not be reduced to less than 2 inches at 30 M. P. H. without introducing a break in the air flow
tha t m aterially reduces the value of the maximum lift . F or instance, a wing with a 2-inch chord
at the tip and a 3-inch mean chord, gives a uniformly better performance than a similar constant
section wing, but if the tip is reduced to I i inches, with the same mean chord, the performance
is markedly inferior to the constant section wing. Again, section No . 49 (P lots 21 , 22, 23 ),
having a 24-inch span and a I t -inch chord at the tip, gave a maximum L c 0.00360, but when

3 inches were cut off of each tip, leaving an 1 -inch span and a 2-inch chord at the tip (Fig. 24),
the m aximum Le was in creased to 0.00413. This does not prove, ho"e'\er, that on a full-sized
machine, where t he LV is large, a small chord at the tip is a disadvantage.
F or this same reason it seems probable tha t wind-tunnel te ts on wings with raked and
rounded tips, although showing a considerable advantage over a square tip, do not show as
comparatively great an improvement as actually occurs on the full-sized machine. I n order
to investigate this m atter fully, a series of similar sections should b e t ested with the greate t
possible range in LV.
This subj ect of varying the chord was t aken up not so much wi th the hope of improving the
' aerodynamic properties of the wing, but because of the structural advantages pos essed by
this type of wing. When the chord is dimini hed at the tip and increased at the center, not only
is the spar depth increased at the center, but the center of lift of the wing is brought closer to the

spars can be brought together at the tips as in the German Ago, simplifying and increasing the

SUMMARY.

It is a rather difficult m atter to compare the properties of the different sections tested
because of the number of variables present. It was thought that a comparison could be best
made by plotting the mean thickness of th~ wing against the Lc, D c, and LID for various angles
of incidence, and against LID for various value of Lc. Instead of using the actual 'thickness
of the wing the ratio of the span to the mean thickness is used, and will be termed thickness
ratio. In this report the term will be applied only when the aspect ratio is six. Another
characteristic of the wing is the ratio of the mean thickness of the wing to the maximum thickness, or amount of taper. These characteristics for a number of the wings are tabulated below :

On plots 25 to 28 the properties of these wings are plotted against thickness ratio. It was
not expected that the points would lie on a smooth curve, but it was hoped that there would
be enough regularity to dctenrune a mean line, from which the deviation of the points could
be studied.

AN.!: UAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

It is s~en from plot 25 that the lift coefficient decreases with an increase of thielmcss ratio,
and of courS'J will approach the values for a flat plate. As the thickness ratio is decl'cas"cl below
50 t e L c at low angles begins to increase rapidly, but at high anglcs increas s less ra~idly and
at the high st lift has reached a maximum at about 37. It is inkrc sting to notice that ,,-inbs
Nos. 43 and 16, having practically the same mean thiclmess, lie clos ... ly together up to 6°,
after which the flow breaks on the former and its lift values at high anO'les arc very lo·\\,. All
the other points lie clos~ly to the mean ClU'WS and show nothing of intcTl st.
On plot 26 it is S:len that the drag at low angles increas s as the thickness rat 0 deCI'eas s,
but at 10° the drag is a minimum when the thickncss ratio is 0, aut! at 14° when it is 50. ~\.t
low angles the drag is quite regular, but at high angles the points do not lie on a smooth ClU've.
As would be exp cted, wing No. 43 has abnormally high values of drag above 6", but below
this agrees well with No. 16. Wing No. 52, and to a less~r extent No. 51, show D.n um.:sually
low rag at small angles and, a laJ'ge drag at high angles. From the table above it will be noticed
that th<.sB two wings have the greattst taper of any.

The points on plot 27 are n aturally less regular than on the others, but it is evident that
the efficiency increases with the thic1mess ratio between 2° and 8°, but ali lower and
higher angles it occurs at a lower thickness ratio. The efficiency is higher with the thicker
wings at 0° only b eca1.:.s~ t11:s angle is farther from the angle of zero lift on the thidc wings and
n ot because thrse wings are more efficient at high speeds. At high angles, howevel', wings with
a thickness ratio of about 50 are the most efficient.
This is shown more clearly on plot 2 where the efficiency is plotted agaillst thickness
ratio for vario1.:.s values of Lc. F or low values of Lc the efficiency increases steadily with the
thickness ratio, but at Lc of 0.0014 the efficiency reaches a maximum, which moves to lower
values of thickness ratio as the Lc increases. Again Nos . 52 and 51 show an abnormally high
efficiency at low and medium values of Lc. No. 16 shows a slightly higher LiD at all angl s
than No. 43.

AERODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF THICK AEROFOILS.

It may be concluded from these curves that the areodynamic properties of a series of
similar winO's depend in a regular way on the mean thickness, no matter what the taper. It
seems possible then to predict the properties of any "Varying section wing with fair accuracy
from a study of similar constant section wings. It is impossible, however, to exceed at any
point of the wing an hie ratio of 0.159 without exceeding the critical value. Therefore, in order
to obtain the highest maximum lift, the wing should be of constant scction. Wings that have a
considerable degree of taper appear to ha"Ve b etter high-speed properties than uniform s:'ction
wings. This improvement is not "Vcry large but is well outside the experimental error.
In order to show clearly the Telative properties of the various sections tes ted and their
relation to the usual types of wings, their more important characteristics arc tabulated below,
together with a few repersentative thin s:,ctions:

In comparison with the usual types of thin ections a thick uniform section like No. 16
shows the following difIerences:
1. Thick sections may give 50 per cent higher maximum lift.
2. Thick sections arc more likely to gi"Ve an unstable fiow at largc angles of incidence.
3. On thick sections the angle of no lift occurs at lower angles of incidence and the burble
point at higher angle , thus extending the angular flying range.
4. Thick sections have a flaLLer drag curve; that is, the minimum drag is higher, but
Dc ri es less rapidly on either side of the minimum.
5. The L ID une for thick sections i fiatter than for thin sections, ri ing to a lower maximum, but holding a value close to its maximum at high and low angle of incidence.
6. The center of pressure travel of thick sections is further to the rear and of les extent
than on thin sections.
7. Thick section are more efficient at high angles of incidence.
The best tapered sections give lower maximum L ID than the thin sections, but the efficiency
at all other point is a good.
By tapering the wing both in plan form and thickness it should be po ible to construct a
wing which has an hie ratio in the center (mean chord) of 0.270 and aerodynamic properties
comparing quite favorably with the thin sections u cd now. This thickne would make
pos ible the usc of 14-inch spar on a 5-foot mean chord. A tapered. wing has the advantage
of having the greater part of the lift on the portion of the wing close to the body, due both to
the greater area and to higher lift sections at this part of the wing, thus decreasing the
bending moment in the spars.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

To illustrate the value of thick wings on a machine, the performance is plott.ed for a 400
H. P. 3,600-pound biplane, using first a R. A. F. 6 section with the usual wing bracing, second,
sect ion 53 with the same bracing, and third, 53 without external bracing. No corrections
were added to the data from wind tunnel test , as only comparative results were required.

Compared with the R. A. F . 6, No. 53 section under the same conditions of structural
r()sistance gives the same power to climb and increases the maximum speed 4 M. P. H. Without interplane bracing this section increases the climb about 20 per cent and the maximum
speed from 122 to 140 M. P. H.
It s ems evident from these tests on models that wings may be designed with ample room
for cantilever spars and have at the same time aerodynamic properties comparing favorably
with the thin sections used now.
This subject of varying section wings is so large that only a beginning has been made in
this report, for there is an almost infinite number of variables to study. The results, however,
show enough promise to warrant further research with wings in which the chord and thickness
are varied in a more complex manner. The thick tapered wings should also be tested on full3ized machines,

REPORT No. 76.
FUSELAGE STRESS ANALYSIS.
By

EDWARD

P.

\rARNER AND ROY

G.

MILLER.

INTRODUCTION.

There i , at the present time, a wide diversity in the methods employed by designers fOJ
analyzing the stres os in a fusC'lage of the built-up type in which the shear is taken by diagonal
bracing wires, and there is a similar diver ity of opinion as to the be t type of analysis manifested
in the standards and specification i sued by various governmental agencies.
In a specification for pursuit machines ( ro. 1003) issued by the ignal Corps just after the
United States entered the war, the requirement is that the fuselage be designed to stand a dynamic load factor of 5 and a tail load of 27 pounds per square foot for machines having a maximum
horizontal p ed of 100 miles per hour, 38 pounds per square foot where the maximum horizontal
peed was 120 miles per hour, and 0 on for higher or lower speeds, the load per unit of area varying as the square of the speed. For machines making 100 miles per hour this corresponded to a
t ail load of 5.4 pounds per quare foot for each unit of dynamic lord. This i very nearly equal
to the relation between these two loads now laid down in the Air Service's specifications for fuselage sand load tests, where it is prescribed that the tail load shall be 5 pounds per square foot
for each unit of dynamic loarl. A fuselage should, with this type of loading, stand a dynamic
load of at least 4, with 20 pounds per square foot on the tail. The general specifications of the
Bureau of Construction and Repair, United States Navy, fix the required tail load at 20 pounds
per square foot, but combine with this only the weight of the machine without a dynamic factor.
These specifications relate primarily to flying loads. In studying the distribution of load
on landing, also, there is some difference of opinion as to the best method of procedure, although
the vexed question of tail loading is avoided in this case. Obviously there are many different
ways in w11ich a landing may be effected, and the di -tribution of the landing loads, as well as
their magnitude, will vary with the speed of the machine, its attitude at the instant of touching
the ground, the position of the controls, the nature of the ground, and a number of other factors.
The method adopted in this report is, in the main, the straightforward one of choosing a
standard type of machine, analyzing it by many different methods, and comparing the results.
The loadings for all of the even caSes studied are illustrated in figures 1 and 2, and the stresses
in the members for all the loadings tried are tabulated at the end of the report.
In the tabulation, the large t stress occurring in each member has been printed in italic .
Where the same member may take tension or compression under different loadings, the maximum stre s of each sort i printed in italics. In picking out the maxima, Ca VII was ianored for reasons which wiU be apparent later. In some cases it has been possible to make
results clearer by analytical discussion, but the graphical analysis has been canied through in
every ca e. The dynamic factor used is 5 in all cases, this being con idered to allow for very
heavy landings and al 0 for the worst loads experienced in fiying. If the sizes of members
were being selected, a further "material factor" or true factor of saf ty of about 1~ should be
allowed over the tabulated stresses (i. e., the ultimate strength of each member should be at
least 1! times the largest stress set down against that member in the table).
If a really thorough and accurate analysis of the stresses in an airplane were to be made

fuselage as is the invariable custom. The drag wires and other members so intel'-Gonnect the
parts of the machine that no single part can be treated independently with strict accuracy.
o many uncertainties arise, however, chiefly due to the presence of redundant mc·mbers, the
stress in which is determined by the rigidity of their end connections and by the initial tension
with which they are set up, that it is usually best to consider these redundant inter··connecting
members as additional safeguards, and not to take them into consideration in figUl'ing stresses.
Thero are some conditions, however, as will be seen in connection with Case VI, where it would
be manifestly absUl'd to ignore entirely the eflect of the external drag wires on t" e fuselage
stresses.
The fuselage adopted is similar to that of the J J4H. The layout of the center lines of the
members is identical with that in the J J4H, but the load distribution differs in some particulars
from that adopted in the Curtiss deSIgn, and the stresses given in the report therefore should not
be ta -en as representing those actually existing in the J .
LANDING LOADS.

'rhe landing stresses have been examined on four different sets of assumptions, tlU'C'e relating to landings with the tail high, the fourth to those with the tail low (three-point). The lift
of the wings has been nealeeted in all cases. Its inclusion or omi ion has little cffect on any
stre _cs except those in the cha i struts and in the vertical members directly over them. If
the weight of the airplane be broken up into loads applied at the panel points in the usual manner, and if the urn of these loads be opposed by a vertical force acting at the axle, which is
manifestly the only place that it can act until the tail skid touches the ground, the :resultant of
the loads at the panel points will pa s through the center of gravity, " T
hile the vertical through
the axle will pass well forward of this point. Therefore, although the two resultant forces are
equal in magnitude f\.nd opposite in direction they are not directly opposed, and their resultant
is a tUl'nino- moment which, if a landing were actually made under these conditions, would whip
the tail of the machine violently downward. Actually, however, the force applied at the axle
is not vertical, but is inclined backwards by the frictional resi tance to forward motion. This
frictional resistance varies ,videly with the nature of the ground, but it is common to arbitrarily
assume, in order to simplify the analysis, that it is just sufficient to incline the line representing
the resultant ground reaction until it pusses through the center of o-ravity. If this a sumption
be made the two r sultant forces (ground reactions and resultant of load at panel. points) no
10ngC'r give a moment, as they hoth pa s through the center of gravity, but they are no longer
directly opposed, and there is an unbalanced horizontal force which mu t be taken care of in
order that complete statical equilibrium of ('be SLructure may be ecured. The securing of
statieal equilibrium i , of cour e, an essential condition for the closure of any stress diagram .
The horizontal component of the ground r action has been treated in two different ways (Cases I
and HI ). In the first, it is a umed that this force is not balanc'ed by any externrL force, and
I
that the machine is therefore decelerating. The deceleration of the several weight3 applied at
the panel points tends to throw them forward, and the resultant of the weight an the inertia
force lies in a line parallel to the resultant ground reaction. Since the vertical c mponent of
each force remains unchanged, the load at each panel point should be multiplied b:y- the secant
of the angle through which its line of action is tumed by the inertia force. Thi.; method of
applying landing loads was first suggested and applied by J. A. RocM) The distribution
between the upper and lower panel points of the parts of a load is inversely proportional to
the distances from the load to the panel points (ju t like the supporting reactions for a simple
beam). This is rigorously correct for the horizontal components, but not for the vertical ones,
since the end fixtures of fuselage struts usually will not transmit tension, and vertical loads
applied between the ends of the strut are transmitted to the longeron entirely at the lower end
of the strut. It was shown in Mr. Roche's article that the maximum stresses are ot changed
in any member if the vertical and horizontal loads are both divided between tho upper and
'Methods Used ill Fillding Fuselage Stresses ,by J. A. RocM: Aerial Age, July 23,1917, vol. 5, p. 642.

lower panel points in the proportion correct for the horizontal ones, and such an arrangement
of loads, making tho lines of action of all the forces parallel to each other, greatly simplifies the
work. The second method is to balance the horizontal component of ground reaction directly
by a thrust load. This is the condition in taxi-ing, and is illustrated in Case III. The assumption that the tln-ust is large Bnough to balance completely the horizontal component while the
dynamic load is a maximum is rather severe, as the thrust would havB to be about equal to the
weight of the machine when thB dynamic load was 5. The figmes obtained on this assumption,
however, at least serve to show in which members the stress is increased by a tln-ust load.
Case II is intended to relate to the same condition as Case I, but in a simplified form making
it unnecessary to deal with inclined loads. In tead of taking the reactions at the points of
attachment of the chassis strust as passing along the struts, so that their resuHant might pass
through the axle, the resultant of the panel-point loads is opposed, in Case II, by a vertical
force passing through the center of gravity. The forces in the chassis struts are then arbitrarily replaced by two vertical forces acting at the same points and so proportioned that their
resultant is the line just spoken of. All external forces are then vertical, there are no inertia
forces, and the resultants of the upward and downward forces both pass through the center
of gravity and there is complete equilibrium. This is manilestly an easy case to deal with,
and the stress diagram in Case II is much simpler than that in Case I, where the external forces
can not all be represented on a single straight line. The simplified method has been used by
the airplane engineering department of the Air Service.
It is evident that the entire omission of the horizontal components of the chassis strut
forces will have a considerable effect on the stresses in the longerons in the bays between the
points of attachment of the two struts. This is particularly noticeable in a machine like the .IN,
where the upper ends of the chassis struts are widely separated and their slope is small. An
inspection of the tabulation of the results of the analyses shows that the stresses in the top
longeron near the rear of the body are greater for Case II, those in the bottom longeron for Case I.
Thi is natmal, as the inertia components of the loads, acting from the free end toward the
supporting reactions, tend to increase the compression in the lower longeron and counterbalance
the tension in the upper one. The stresses in the struts and wires are nearly the same for the two
cases except in the bays between the points of attachment of the chassis struts. This, again, is
what might be expected, as, the longerons being nearly parallel and horizontal, the primary
duty of the wires is to carry the shear due to vertical loads, while the strut compressions are
almost exactly equal to the vertical components of the stresses in the adjacent wires. Strut
and wire stresses are therefore substantially unaffected by horizontal components of load at the
panel points. In no case, except in the bays between the chassis struts and in a few other bays
of the top longeron, is the difference of stre s in a member for the two cases as much as 5 per
cent. The percentage difference is large in some of these cases, but only where the magnitude
of the stresses is small and where the factor of safety would be sme to be very large. The simplified method of Case II leads to an overestimation of the top longeron stresses, as compared
with Case I, by about 100 pounds in one bay . . The important differences come in the bays between chas is struts. The type of loading used in Case II is manifestly wrong for these bays, and
the inclusion of the horizontal components of the strut reactions changes the magnitude of the
stresses very radically. In the case of the lower longeron, the effect of these components is to
change the stress from a large compression to a tension. The difference between the two cases
in the upper longeron is much smaller but the simplified method is not on the safe side. In
the struts, the stress given by the simplified method is too high in the member directly over
the rear chassis strut, and too low in all others. The only pair of wires much affected is that
in the rear bay, where different wires are in tension in the two cases.
Summing up, it is evident that the method of Case II is satisfactory for the rearof the body,
but that it gives results very badly in error for some of the members in the neighborhood of the
chassis attachment. The simplified loading can well be used for a preliminary analysis to assist
in estimating the sizes of members, but it should not be considered as satisfactorily covering
the landing loads by itself. When it is employed there should be added to the stresses in the

718

ANNUAL REPOTIT NATIONAL ADVISORY COiV[MITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

bays of the lower longeron between the chassis struts an amount equal to the horizontal com-

ponent which would exi t in the adjacent chassis strut if the loading of Case I were used. This
horizontal component can be found by drawing a triangle of forces . (The addition :.s algebraic,
compre ions being taken as negative, and the euect usually is to change the sign of the stresses.)
Case III (ground friction balanced by thrust) give result identical ,yith those of Ca e II
for all members behind the rear cha is strut. The effect of thru t can be satisfactorily allowed
for by adding (algebraically) one-sixth of the weight of the machine to the stre s in Every bay of
each longeron from the no e to the front cha is strut, and one-tenth the weight to the tres es
in the longeron between the cha is struts. If the engine is carried in such a way that the thrust
can only be transmitted to the fu elage at the rear of the bearers the addiLion Lo allow for thru t
load can, of course, be omitted fonV'aru of this point.
Ca e IV relates to a three-point landing. The largest dynamic loads usually occur in this
type of landing, as a pilot having a forced landing on rough ground will land at as Iowa speed as
possible, and the tail-skid will therefore come into contact with the ground before the shock
absorbers on the wheels have had time to extend fully. The only ca e in ,,-hich a large dynamic
load is likely to occur on a high-speed landing (I and II) is that in which Lhe pilot is unskilled or
landing in the dark and fails to flatten out early enough. In con idering the landing with
tail low all the load have been taken perpendicular to the top longeron. The effect of friction
and of inertia loads is thus allowed for, a the perpendicular to the top longeron makes an angle
of about 100 with the true vertical when the machine is resting on the ground. To be trictly
accurate, the reactions should be drawn wi th dillerent inclinations, as the coefficient of friction
of the tail-skid is much greater than that of the wheels, out the euect of allowing for this differen.ce would be too small to warrant the additional complication. Since the point of contact of the
tail-skid is some distance behind its point of attachment, the reaction of the tail-skid has a moment
about its hinge. This is allowed for in the way in which it is actually taken through the hinge
and shock-absorber cord in the machine, by putting on equal and opposite horizomal forces at
the top and boLtom of the strut where the tail-skid is attached. Since the pull in the shockabsorber cord has a vertical component, there should be added another pair of vertical forces,
equal and opposi te. The e have been omi tted from the diagram, as their only effect is to increase
the compre ion in the strut over the tail-skid.
The tail-skid load reverses the stre ses in the longerons behind the rear chass' strut and
chancres the diagonal which takes tension in several cases, as compared with the loadmg arrangemen1s which have already been con idered. The stress in the front cha sis trut and in the fuselage strut directly opposed to it are also somewhat greater in a three-point than in a two-point
landin cr , because of the backward ,inclination of the reaction causincr the fr nt trut to carry a
smaller share of the total load in the latter ca e than in the former.
The conclu ion is that landing tresses should be analyzed for three-point landing (Case
IV) and for two-point landings with inclined ground reaction and inertia load (Case I) and
that allowance should be made for the eITect of thrust on the stre es in the forward bays of
the 1 ngeron , e pecially the upper one. If only ono stress diagram is to be drawn for landing
load it should be for the ca e with tail- kid reaction, as the analy is for flying conditions is
very similar in mo t particulars to that for a two-point landing, and give tres es of the same
Ol'del' in the rear of the body, whereas there is no other typo of loading ,Yhich resembles that
enco ntered when landing with tail down clos ly enough to be sub tituted for it.
FLYING LOADS.

It is cu tomaI'y, in analyzing the fusela~c trcs es under flying conditions, to consider only
the rear portion of the structure, and to treat this as a cantilever loaded in accord~nee with
some set of assumptions and ·supported either at the rear wing spars or the lower spars. The
first a sumption as to the support is the more common, but the United tates avy specifications call for an analysis with the reactions taken at the lower wing hinge " which appears to be
more logical.

It is 'Very desirable that the analysis under flying conditions be extended to co'Ver the wl~ ol e
structure, from nose to tail. \\11ile this is not possible by an extension of the ordinary meLhod
with an arbitrarily fixed tail load, the stress diallram failing to close if it is carried on past the
wing hinges to the nose of the airplane, a closed diagram can ahyays be secured if full account is
Laken of all the forces acting on the airplane and of its motions under those forces.
The downward loads on an airplane fuselage in flight may be di-nded into dynamic loads
and tail loads. The dynamic loads are due to the acceleration of the center of gravity of the
machine (usually an acceleration parallel to the normal axis of the machine, arising in flattening
out after a dive or in some similar sudden change of cour e). Since the lines of action of the
dynamic loads on all parts of the machine at a g-iwn instant are parallel so long as there is no
angalar acceleration of the air})li1ne about its C. G., antI since tho dynamic loads at the panel
points are proportional to the ,,'eights coneentratecl at. those panel points the resultant of these
.
loads always passes through the C. G. of the machine.
The tailload, in turn, may be divided into three parts. First is the load, usually downward, required to gi'Ve static equilibrium about the C. G. This part of the load usually ha , for
any particular machine, a maximum 'Value of about 4 percentof the wing loading, ilseXil.ct nUl.gnitude depending on the position of the center of pressure of the ,'ings \\ ith relation to the center
of gravity. For tail sUlfaces of normal size, this gives a unit loading of about one-quarter of
the unit wing loading. The second part of the tail load goes to oYCl'come the damping moment
(Mq) due to Lhe body, wUlf s, and chassis. This moment is about 18 pel' C(,11t of the totn,} ci<lmping moment due to the acti on of the au- ag:tinst the pitching nirplane. 1 The manner of its distribution is uncertaul, and in these illustrative examples it ,,,as arbitrarily distributed among
the 'Various panel points in such a way that the applied forces ,,'ould sum up to zero, that the sum
of their moments about the C. G. would be equal to 18 per cent of the computed total damping
moment, and that the loads would be approximately proportional to the distances of their
points of application from the C. G. The tail load due to damping appears only when the airplane is rotating about its C. G. (with respect to axes fixed relative to tbe earth). Finally, there
may be an excess of tailloacl abovo the sum of these two components, and this excess acts to
impart an angular acceleration to the !1irplane.
I n considering tail load, the component of damping due to the tail ( 2 per cent of the total)
must be subtracted from the apparent load to get the true value of the total force acting. The
total tail load in any machine at a given instant is then a fWlction of ele\"ator setting, angle of
a.ttack, speed, and angular velocity.
It was just demonstrated that two of the three portions of the tail load can be so balanced
as to give static equilibrium, tho first by the wing load acting at a certain distance from the
center of gravity, the second by properly distributed damping 10f1ds at the panel points. 'fo
balance the thu-d component, the excess producing angular acceleration, inertif1loads must be
applied much as in the case of the deceleration when landing, the difference being thf1t in this
case the structure is treated for the moment as though it had no motions except one of rotation
about the C. G., and the i~el'tia load at each panel point therefore acts perpendicular to the line
connecting that panel POUlt with the C. G. The ratio of the inertia load to the static load at
any panel point is directly proportional to the distance from the C. G. Since the dynamic
loads and each component of the tail load taken separately can be balanced by properly allowing for the accelerations, it is evident that any combination of loads can bo so balanced, and
that it is possible to draw, for any set of fuselage loads which can oCClli' , a closed stress diagram taking in every member of the fuselage and with the wing reactions applied as they actually are in practice.
.
The dynamic loads can only attain theu- maximum value when the angle of attack is
large, and it therefore requires a perceptible interval, after the elevator is pulled up to fif1tten
out from a dive, for the lift on the wings to reach its highest point. The total down load on
the tail, on the other hand, reaches its maximum instantly, as the down load is largest when the

angle of attack is small, when the speed is high, and when the ano-ular velocity and damping
moment are small, and all of these conditions are bcst fulfillcd when the airplane is diying and the
elevator has just been pulled up. It is then evident that the tail loads and dynamic loads
can not reach their maxima at the same time, and any analysis based on the assumption of
largo loads of both types imultaneously applied is unduly severe.
a
Furthermore, any an" lysis in which a maximum down load is applied on the "ail and balanced only by reactions at the wing hinges is unduly severe. \i\hen there is a laro-e tail load
ther always exists an angular acceleration, and this produces inertia loads which act upwardly
on the rear part of the body, directly balancing the tail load. It can not be too strongly emphasized that the structure as a whole will ahYaYs be in statical equilibrium if tho inertia and
damping loads are properly applied, and that there is something wrong ~vith any sot of loading
assumptions which permits of the existence of an unbalanced moment ahout t: e center of
gravity.
In connection with the prescItt report the typi cal fuselage has been analyzed for three
different types of .flying loads. Cases V and VI were carried through in accordance with the
met ods just discussed, aU inertia loads being included. Case V relates to tbe maximum
dynamic load, Ca e VI to the maximum tail load. In Case VII an analysi was made for the
rear position of the body in accordanco with the common assumptions of a dynamic factor of 5,
a tail load of 25 pound per square foot, and the rear of the hody acting as a ca tilever support.ed at the rear wing spar .
The fundamontal data for Cases V and VI were based on an analysis of the behavior of a
IN in a divo and loop, an analysis tho most important results of which were published in the
Bulletin of the Airplane Engineering Department, nited States Army. In connection with
the discu sion there printed the effect of inertia loads arising from angulru: accdoration was
taken up, but no attempt was made to carry through a complete analysis of tho S1,re sos under
.flying conditions. The as umptions on which that analy is was ba ed were rather too severe,
a 1,he maximum dynamic factor by computation was .14, whereas it has beon shown by
accolerometer tests that the dynamic factor seldom rises above 4 and apparently llever reaches
4.5. A dynamic factor of 5 was taken as the standard in these illustrative problem , ju t as
for the landing loads, and the computed liiLs, tail loads, accelerations, etc., were therefore
reduced in tho ratio 5:~~. This procedure is not entirely justifiable, but it gives as good
results as can be attainod without another complete analysis of a dive.
Ca e V relates, not to the exact in tant of maximum dynamic load, but to the time, 0.42
second aft.x pulling up tho elevator, and 0.1 second before the peak of the ynamic load
curve is reached, when the angular accelerati0n is zero. Thi very much simplifies the analysis
by eliminating the "rotative inertia" loads in this case, and has little effect on the votal tresses,
as the dynamic load at the instant when the angular acceleration di appears is only 4 per cent
below its maximum value. The angle of attack of the wings, in thi ca e, wa about 12°,
. and ~he resultant force on the wings was therefore very nearly perpendicular to the chord.
Tho total lift was divicled among the four wing hinges on each side, the lower hinges taking
about 85 p ...r cent. of th total lift b ecau e of th transmi sion of lift from the upper wing through
the inl.1e1' lift cables to the low r hinges. The di tribution betw en the front and rear bing s
dep ends on the position of the center of pre urc. The tail load vector wa al'biLrarily drawn
parallel to that for wing load, although the LID for the tail is Ie s than that for tho wings. The
tresses in the fuselage would be very little affectod by changing tho slope of the tail vector.
The normal tail load for the speed, angle of attack and elevator angle exi ting at the
in tant to which Case V relates would be 10 pounds per square foot if there were no angular
velocity. The attribution of 2 per cent of the damping moment to the tail and the deduction
of the appropri.ate amount from the tail load reduces this by about 70 per cen'j, 0 that the
actual tail load corresponding to a dynamic factor of 5 is 2.5 pounds per square foot. This figure would be larger in a machine where the center of gravity was farther forward relative to
the wings, but it would never exceed 10 pound per square foot.

distribute the drag of the body, the whole amount being combined ,,'lith the wing drag and
applied at the hinges. There, again, the procedure is not rigorously correct, as mo t of the
fuselage drag should act at the nose, but the diff rence hetween the exact n,nd approximate
distribution of fuselage drag would be negligible.
Thrust and torque load do not appear in any of the analy e under .flying loads, as the
speed in a limiting dive is so high that there could not be any thrust or very much torque, the
propeller tending to operate a a windmill rather than as a propeller. The thrust and torque
loads appear in normal .flight, and may be important enough to require special annlysi in highpowered airplanes with engines having a very low weight per horsepower. There is a gyro~copic torque when !lattenmg out from a dive, and this modifies the tressc in thefu elage
members lying in horizontal planes, including the longeron , but it will not be con idered in
'
this report.
The analy is in Case VI is very complex, as the loads act in every conceivable direction.
They divide, in general, into three groups. Fir t are a set of load due to tran lational accelerations. These all act along parallel line , and, since the lift at the instant after the elevator
is pulled up is insignificant, their line of action are very nearly parallel to the flight path, the
only acceleration which amount to anything being the negative acceleration along the path,
due to the exces of total drag over the component of gravity along the path. The second
ince the lines of action of
group is made up of the inertia loap. due to angular acceleration.
these loads arc perpendicular to the lines connecting their respective panel points with the
center of gravity, no two of them act in the ame direction, and the drawing of a load diagram
becomes a rather complicated and tedious operation. Lastly, there are the external loads, due
to air pre sure, which balance all the e inertia load. The total load on the tail is roughly 31
pounds per quare foot, and its component perpendicular to the flight path is approximfLtely
equal to the corre3ponding component of the force on the wing , so that the resultant i , as
already noted, parallel to the flight path. The vector of free on the wings at the very mall
angle of attack existing during the dive (- 3} 0 for thi particular machine) is inclined at
about 45 0 to the perpendicular to the chord, and there i therefore a large componen.t of this
force which must be taken by the drag bracing. Thi ' bracing system ha several redundanries"
as there are three external drag wires on each ide of the fu elaO"e, and there is also .a possibility
that the drag may be carried through the tagger wires to the lower wing and thence directly to
the fuselage at the lo\rer wing hinges. The di tribution of the drag between the e four alternative routes is necessarily uncertain, depending largely on the initial tension in the se,era]
member, but it is absolutely certain that a large share of the dmO" is transmitted through the
external bracing to the nose of the fuselage in a machine which, like the J J, has no stagger
wires in the center section. In Case VI it was a sumed that 90 per cent of the drag was taken
through the external bracing and 10 per cent at the wing hinge, and that the drag taken by the
external bracing wa divided equally between the upper and lower wires. From the structural
M
tandpoint it i de irable to take as much drag as pos ible through the upper drag wire , as these
wire al 0 carry some lift directly to the nose of the Iu elage, greatly reducing the tre. e in the
forward portion anu also reducing the stresses in the inner bay of the wing tru
There is no damping load to be deducted from the tail load in Case VI, a the machine
can not acquire an angular velocity instantaneously when the tail is pulled up.
A comparison of the stresses in Ca es VI and VII show that the ordinary method, neglecting all inertia loads, gives stresses far higher than those which can actually prevail, the overestimation in some cases being as much a 200 per cent.
Examination of the tabulated stre e for the first ix ca es hows that the maximum
stress in mo t instance occurs in Ca e IV, V, or VI. The maximum comes in Case I in a few
instance, but the stress in Case I never exceed~ by more than 20 per cent the maximum amonO"
IV, V, or VI. Af3 already noted, a dynamic load factor of 5 ill a tail-high landing would be a
very rare occurrence. Case III also hows a few maxima, but only in the forward three bays,

in the first part of this paper. Case IV, V, and VI, then, may be considered as furnishing a

complete and satisfactory anaJysis. Furthermore, since the maximum stresses 0 cur in Caso
VI only in tho threo rear bays of the fuselage it is sufficient, if the work is to be reduced to a
minimum, to start the stress diagram for the condition of maximum tail load at the tail post
and carry it through the three or four rearmost bays.
Since the complete analysis of a diYe has been carried through for only one machine, it is
necessary to make certain assumptions as to the magnitude of the damping moments in order to
determine the load distribution analogous to Case V for a new machine. The anO'le of attack for
a dynamic load factor of 5 may be taken as 12°, nnd the tail load required to balanco the moment
of the wing load about the C! G. can then be computed. Two pounds per squaro loot, of tail
surfa,ce should be added to tItis to n110w for damping, and static equilibrium restored by modifying the dynamic loads in the manner already described.
Cases analogous to VI require fewer assumptions, as there is no damping. The total tail
load can be determined from a wind tunnel test of a model with the elevators turned up or
approximated from the results of such a test on a similar machine. The tail load required to
balanre the wing moment can be computed as before, the angle of attack being computed for a
45 ° dive at limiting speed. All the rcst of the tail load goes to produce angular acceleration,
a,ocl is balanced by inertia loads applied in the manner alrcady described. The distribution of
the drag will diller in different types of machines, and no definite rules can be hid down, but
caution should be exercised not to make the pull in the upper illag wires too large, ns the apparent
stresses are reduced by so doing. It is better to keep on the safe side and take an excessive
proportion of tho drag in the lower wires and at the wing hinges.
These notes on loading also furnish some suggestions for the making of sand load tests on
fuselages. It is evident that a load of ~o pounds per square foot on the tail, whether or not it is
accompanied by a dynamic load, produces larger stresses than would be experienced in practice,
and a sand loud for maximum tail load would correspond more nearly to actual conditions if
upward loads were applied by ropes passing over pulleys and attachcd at the panel points, to
represent the efIect of "rotative inertia." If a single sand load tcst is to be made, however, it
would be belter to have the loading correspond to the conditions of Case V, with some increase
in the tail load to bring the stresses in the rear bays nearcr to the maxima found in Case VI.
The specificn.tions would then be:
Tail load of 12 pounds. per square foot corresponding to a dynamic load of 5, these loads
being increased in the some proportion until failure. (These loads are for a training machine.
For airplanes having a normal wing loading of over G pounds per square foot, the ~ail10ad corresponding to a dynamic factor of 5 should be increased, reaching a maximum of 18 pounds per
square foot when the normal wing loading is 10 pounds per square foot.)
The loads at panel points not to be exactly equal to tho product of the dynamic factor by
tbe weight concentrated at the pn.nel point, but to be increased forward of the center of gravity
and reduced behind the C. G. to allow for damping effect on the body and appendages (not
including the tail unit). The percentage of increase or reduction should be proportional to the
horizontal distance from the C. G. to the point of application of the load, and the total moment
about the C. G. of these changes of load should be such that, when the fuselage is supported
at the lower wing hinges, the supporting reactions will be in inverse proportion to the distances
from the hinges to the center of pressure of the wings at n.n angle of attack of 12°. This will
do away with the difficulty now experienced when a large tail load is applied in a sand load test
without any allowance for damping or inertia loads. The fuseln.go tends to pivot about the
rear support, and it is necessary arbitrarily to add a large concentrated load at the extreme
n se in order to prevont local failure at the rear support.

INTRODUCTIO .

The most important single problem in aeronautics awaiting olution is that of in(;reasing
the speed ral1f"e of airplane. In recent years maximum speeds have been increased very
Jreatly, and will no doubt be still further increa cd, but each addition ha been accompanied
by an increa e in the landing speed. The landing peecl has always been about half the maximum
and could not be reduced below that amount without entailing the expenditure of additional
power. This is due primarily to the propertie of the type of wing ,,-hich has been used.
In flying, the method utilized to change the speed i to alter the angle of attack of thl'
planes. This must also be accompanied by an alteration in the power output of the engine if
the machine i to be kept flying level. Manipulation of the engine throttle without alteration
of the angle of the planes will not cause a change in speed; the machine will ascend or decend at
its former speed. The speed is therefore dependent on the angle of attack. If thi could be
efficiently varied from a very small to a very laro-e angle, a wide range of speeds could be obtained.
Two things prevent thi : First, the lift doe not increase directly with the angle of incidence fol'
all angles. It does do 0 up to about 15° but for greater angle , in tead of inrrea ing, the lift
actually fall off. This falling off occur in all type of wings thouah in ome case it i only
slight and in other very considerable. It i well show11 in the lift cmve in figme 14, and is
also apparent in all the other lift curves shown in this report-in figure ,17, and 20. Consequently no increase in speed range can be obtained by increasing the angle of incidence beyond
15°. Second, the efficiency of the plane j not maintained at low angle.
the in cidence is
reduced from the maximum of 15°, both the lift and the drag decrease, the drag at fir t falling
off more rapidly than the lift. At about 3 ° a point i reached whore the ratio of lift to drag is
a maximum. This i the mo t efficient flying angle for the plane. ~\. the incidence i fmther
decreased, the lift continues to fall off rapidly. The drag, however, decrease more lowly,
being a minimum at zero incidence. For negative angles it aO'ain increase .
This means that the ratio of lift to drag fall off very rapidly, and the wings of a machine
flying at a malleI' angle of incidence than 3° offer more resistance than they do at that angle.
The line from which the e anole are mea ured j the chord of the aeroioil, i. e., the common
tangent to the lower mface. It will be noticed that thi i not necessarily the position in which
the winQ: give no lift. Mo t wings give a considerable lift whell their chord line i parallel to
tho direction of the ail' flow, and this lift only becomes zero when the nose of the wing i about
:3° below the trailing edge. In fact, fast machine frequently fly with their plane' . ct at negative
angles.
If a maximum peed of double the minimum i to be obtained, the machine IUU t fly under
the inefficient conditions existing at these small positive or even mall negative angles of incidence. If it is to be more than double, as it must be in order to obtain a rea on able landing

speed in machines flying at over 100 miles an hour, the small lift necessary at high speeds IS
accompanied by a prohibitive drag.
'rhe problem of increasing the speed range may be approached in a number of ways, but
confining ourselves to devices applicable to the present type of airplane, which eliminates the
helicopter and similar machines, there are three ways by which a solution might e achieved.
These are:
Variable angle of incidence.
Variable surface.
Variable camber.
Each of these presents great mechanical difficulties, but the first is the easiest of attack and
has consequently approached nearer a solution than either of the other two. It offem two ad,antage~ : First, the axis of the fuselage can be kept parallel to the path of flight at all speeds, thus
securing a minimum drag over the entire speed range. In the present machine, having the
wings fixed in relation to the fuselage, the fuselage is at a considerable angle to the flight path
over a portion of the speed range. Under these conditions the variable incidence machine is
more efficient than the present type. Over that portion of the speed range where the fuselage
of the standard machine lies along the iIight path, or only a few degrees from it, the variable
incidence machine offers little or no advantage.
econd, the wings of the variable incidence
machine can be tilted to a much greater angle than is possihle in the present m ,chinp,. This
permits the machine to be brought to rest more rapidly. It docs not, however, reduce its minimu flying speed. Thus the advantages of variable incidence, though well worth attainment,
do ot provide a sufficiently complete solution of the problem.
The next for consideration is variable surface. Theoretically, this gives a perfect solution.
If the wings of the airplane could be increased in area during flight, the speed could be reduced so
as to land as slowly as desired. Conversely, given sufficient surface to insure a low enough
Ian ing speed, if the surface could be reduced in flight the planes could always be made to
operate at the angle of incidence giving the best lift/drag ratio, thus securing the least possible
dl'l1g at maximum speeds. Unfortunately, mechanical difficulties prevent the realization of
this method. These difficulties are so serious that there does not seem any prospect of their
being overcome in the near future.
Finally, there is variable camber. This offers advantages very much greater than variable
incidence, but is more difficult of solution mechanically. On the other hand, as compared
with variable surface, it is mechanically possible, but its aerodynamic advantages are not <juite
so great. Yet they are, however, great enough to provide a satisfactory solution of the problem
and the only one, apparently, which is practicable.
~
So much for the accepted methods of increasing speed range. The method under discussion
in this paper can not be properly classified under any of these headings. In conception, however,
it is derived from variable surface, though the mechanical device utilized is distinctly variable
co. bel'.
Let us return to the concc-ption of variable sun ace. A machine so equipped would have a
comparatively small amount of fixed surface, together wjtll a larger amount of removable surface.
While landing, both fixed and removable surface would be in operation, but at high speeds
the fixed surface alone would support the machine. Assuming that a mechanical device to
operate such a system is possible, it is obvious that the mechanism would entail a considerable
increase in weight, and probably also in head resistance. This may be expressed in terms of the
resistance of the wings that have been removed. For example, 100 units of dr g may have
been eliminated by removing a portion of the wings, but the equivalent of 20 added by the extra
weight and increased resistance. This, then, would leave us a net saving of 80 units.
Suppose, now, that instead of removing the wings we loavo thorn in place, but when they
are not required for lifting we chango them to a shape o[ering only a fraction of their former
dra",. If this fraction is approximately the same as that required for variable surface we will
have nIl the Ild'Vantagcs of variable surface, and the problom will become one of changing the wing from an efficient lifting shape to a shape ofi'ering the least possible resistance; for example,

puro stroam lino. Experimental results show that such a saving can bo offected; tho drag can
bo roduced from 100 units to 25, giving us a not saving of 75 units. In a biplano tho uppor plnno
will bo of fi..'wd construction and the lower ono variable, or vico ,orsa; will 10 in a triplano a suitablo
arrangoment is obtained by using a fixed wing for tho centor plano and placing variablo wings
aboyo and below it. At illgh speeds tho variablo pIanos aro to carry no load and aro to be
stroam lino in shapo, At low speods thoy aro to bear their sharo of tho weight of the machino
and aro to bo deeply cambered. For a stream-lino wing to givo no lift it must lie parallol to
tho direction of tho air flow, and thon tho forces on its upper and lower surfaces arc equal. It
is nocessary, therefore, to set the stream-line planes at zero angle of attack when the fixed planes
are at their anglo of maximum lift/drag, usually about 3°.
For slower speeds tho angle of attack of the fixed plano must be increased, let us say,
from 3° to go, a change in angle of GO. The stream-line plane is carried through the same angle
and now has unbalanced forces acting on it, tending to deform it upward . . Theso forces are the
greatest near the leading odge, and decrease rapidly as the trailing edge is approached. If we
place one wing spar at the leading edgo and another about two-thirds of tho chord back from
it, we divido the wing into two parts, with tho for co on the front part very much greater than
that on the roar part. If, now, we make the part between tho spurs of flexible construction
and the part behind the rear spar rigid, and allow the ribs to slide over tho rear spar, wo provide for a change of shape under load. The portion between tho spars is carried upward, while
tho roar portion, being rigid and £i.\:od to it, mo,os downward. Tho result is a cambored wing.
Tho rib should bo just rigid enough to doform a certain dosired amount undor the maximum
load it should carry normally, and the doformation should be proportional to the load upon the
rib up to fuHlond. Tho load at nny time will depend on tho ratio of tho lift cooffieient of tho
variable plane at its angle of attack to tho lift coefficient of tho fixed plane at its anglo. Thus,
at maximum speed when the ,ariablo plane is stream line in shapo the proportion is zero to the
lift coefficient of the fixed plano, and the load is zero. At landing speed the lift coefficients of
the two planes arc approximatoly equal-the variablo plane is carrying half the load and its load
and deflection are a maximum. In an intermodiate case, when the pIanos are at GO and 9°,
rospocti voly, tho lift coefficients nro, let us say, 1: 3. The variable plane is now carrying a
quarter of the load, or one-half its maximum load, and its shape will be halfway betwoen tho
oxtromes. It is now a lifting aerofoil, but a lightly cambered one. As lightly cambered ael'ofoils
0.1'0 most efficient at small angles, ant! heavily cambered one3 at large angles, the variable wing
possesses tho most suitablo shape throughont its rango.
If the decaln,go romained unchanged, i. e., if the sotting of the variable plane relative to
tho ll.xed plano romained the samo for all angles of attack, when the fixetl plane was at its
angle of maximum lift the variable plane would bo 3° short of it, and would not be operating
under tho bost conditions. This is not tho caso, howe,er. In changing the shape of the wing
the trailing edge was depre3sed and tho angle of attack in consequence was increased. This
change in decalage is dependent on tho position of the rear spar and on the amount of maximum camber. In the aerofoil used it is 3°, so that when the maximum lifting eLIort is required
both fixed and variable pIanos aro operating most efficiently.
It is obvious that under certain conditions-gusts, for example, or flattening out after a
steep di,o-the wing will be subject to a load greator than its normal maximum. This would
bo liable to causo further defloction, which would be undesirable. The wing under discussion
ceases to deilect after the application of its normal maximum load. This is accomplishod by
moaus of an internal bracing system which only comes iuto operation when tho maximum
doflection has been reached.
RIll STRUCTURE.

In dosigning a wing possessing theso variable camber featuros the following considerations
had to be kept in mind:
It had to deform regularly with the load up to unit flying load, then remain rigid under
further applications of load, and bo strong onough to bear so,oral timos its normal load without
failure. It had also to be capable of easy manufacture, to bo simple and foolproof in operation,

The fabric i continuous o,er the wings exc ept ,,-here the lower flexible (h nnel i ('onne(: ted to the tailpio ~ e. Here it is elis~ ontinuou to permit the sliding fOI"l'-ard of the fixed tail

amount of Lhi sliding motion i approximately] in~ h , and it may be proV"ided for either by
allowing the smfar e to o\'"erlap or simply by lea,ing a gap of thi amount. In th former case
the snrface would ju t meet when in the stream-line position and would o,erIap l il1' h in the

tream-line position would lea\'"e open a strip 1 ill"h wide running the length of the wing. It i
not belieyed that thi would be a objectionable a might appear aL first sight, for the aerodyn mic propertie of the wing would not be appre( iably afie~ ted. Present method may b('
used for its attachment to the rib. It will probably be preferable to stitch the fabric to eac h
surf ce separately, though there is no objecLion to the titching going o,er the top and under
the bottom, except aL Lhe rear spar, a the eli tall' es bet"\Yeen the urfaces do not alter. It ,,-a~
nee ary to determine ,,·hether any exces ive stretch in the fabric would be caused by the
fun(: Lioning of the rib. The lower surface change from a eon\'"ex to a (on a\'"e shape of approximately equal curvature. There will, therefore, be no stretch in the fabric. [n the upper surface.
how e,er, where an inerea e of com"ex curvature o("cur , there will be a stretch caused in the
fabric. Calculation hows that thi i not seriou. In a wing of 50-inch chord, with a maximum
imrea e of camber of 21 inehe , the maximum stretch of the fabric i only ] / 100 imh in the 15
inches in "\dueh the greatest change oecur , or 0.057 per cent. .llS the treLeh at rupture i 15
per cent, the fabric is only strained 1/225 of thi amount. It i rea onable to uppose that this
could be repeated indefinitely.

OF TEST.

The construction and testing of the ,arinble camber rib were carried out in f e Engineering ~Iat'eriflls Laboratory of the Bureau of Standards. A special method of testing the rib had
to be devised, permitting the appropriate load to be applied to each surface independently. A
direct system of loading was adopted, the method being clear from figures 2 find 3. Stirrups
were placed over the rib at the desired points and platforms to carry the weights suspended
therefrom. The loads applied were calculated from pressure distribution tables for the R. A. F.
l4 wing, obtained from experiments made at the Royal Aircraft Factory, England.
The chord of the variable rib was 60 inches. The rib spacing was taken as 14 i ches and the
wing loading as 5 ~ pounds per square foot. This gives the total land per rib as 33 ~ pounds,
which was assumed to be distributed as follows:

The total weight of the rib is thus 121 ounces, which compares ,ery favorably 'with standard
wood construction. It is actually lighter than the Curtiss J -4 rib (13 ~ ounces), which was
taken as a basis for chord length,· rib spacing, and loading. More modern ribs, however, are
somewhat lighter.
Material used, chrome vanadium alloy steel.
Thickness, 0.0]8 inch.
Elastic limit, 00,000 pounds per square inch.
Ultimate strength, 102,000 pounds per square inch.

The steel as fabricated was in the annealed state. In some earlier tests heat treatment
was resorted to, and, as might be expected, ga\"e even greater strength, two such ribs having
sustained a loading of 16 times the flying load without signs of failure. Heat treatment ,vas
omitted in the final test in order to demonstrate that the process wns not essential to success.
The experimental rib was placed in an inverted position in a supporting frame and the
loads applied as previously described. Deflection readings were taken by means of lials giving
readings correct to 1/1000 of an inch. Up to unit load, the increments were one-quarter of the
flying load. The deflection of the rib under theso conditions was as follows:

Weights were then applied up to six times the flying load. After this the loading wa.
removed, with the exception of the one-quarter load, to determine the ability of the rib to
return to its original shape after severe overloads. A permanent set amounting to a maximum
of -h inch occurred in the first and second panels. Throughout the rest of its length the rib
returned to the posi tion occupied under the initial one-quarter load.
Finally the rib was loaded to destruction. Failure occurred after the application of a load

first and second panels. Deflection are plotted in figure 4 and tabulated in the appendix. The
maximum deflection from normal flying load to 10 times that load was 0.437 inch, which compares fa\'"orably with that of wooden ribs under similar loads. While subject to the normal
flying load, the shape of the rib was traced upon a board placed b ehind it. Its form agreed
(within t inch) with the designed aerofoil (Y. C. L. , fig. 6).
The rib which gave these results was the last of a series of six. It is not claimed that it
represents the best possible form for such a rib, but marks a point in the development where the
many conllicting requirements are all satisfied.

The first two ribs of the series were made from steel 0.032 inch in thickness a d were heat
treated. The lifting shape aimed at was the Eiffel 36-wing curve. The spars were placed in
the arne positions as in the Curtiss IN-4 and the nose was designed to rotate about the front
spar. The variable portion was divided into four panels, of which three only were provided
with tension-bracing members. The weight was 16 ounces. A change of shape approximately
proportional to the load was obtained, but the tail failed to deflect its full amount and the rotary
motion at the nose was found unsatisfactory. The functioning of the rib is s own by the

The strength was exc ssive, the ribs sustaining a loading of 16 times the flying load, the
limiting capacity of the supporting frame, without signs of failure.
The third rib was of 0.018-inch heat-treated steel and weighed 11 ounces. The front
spar was placed at the leading edge and the rotary motion thus eliminated. The upper surface
was designed to have the shape of the U. S. A. 4 aerofoil, while the lower was determined by
the thickness of the stream line. The nose had to be blunt to accommodate th spar. The
flexible portion was divided into six: panels, all of which were braced, thus making a complete
truss of the rib. The desired change of shape was attained and was proportionnl to the load.
When tested to destruction the rib showed a factor of safety of 11, failure oceurring in the
fixcd tailpiece.
The fourth rib was similar in all respects to the third, except that it was not, heat treated.
It withstood a loading of eight times the normal flying load before buckling over sideways.
Although the desired change of shape was obtained with these two ribs, th(~ lifting shape
was not satisfactory from an aerodynamic point of view. Consequently a special lifting aerofoil
was designed, and an attempt made to construct a rib to this shape. 0.018-inch steel was
again used and the construction was in general similar to that adopted in the third and fourtb
ribs. The amount of motion, however, was considerably greater, and additional tension links
were provided to prevent any change of sbape beyond the stream-line position should the wing
be subject to load on the upper surface. A tension spring was used, attached to the rear spar
and to the compression member of the tailpiece forward of it, instead of a compression spring
behind the rear spar, as was used in the first four ribs.
The functioning of the rib was excellent, the desired lifting shape being aswmed with an
error of less than inch, but the factor of safety when the rib was loaded to destruction was
ollly 7. Failure was due to buckling in the channel forming the lower surface in the first and
second panels. The weight was 12 ounces.

The final rib differed only in minor details, particularly the use of a heavier flange at the
point of failure. This raised the factor of safety from 7 to 11 at an increase of only t ounce in
weight.
AERODYNAMICAL TESTS.

A series of tests were carried out by the Bureau of Standards wind tunnel staff to determine the following points:
1. The properties of four .new aerofoils, being the stream-line and full-lifting shape of the
variable camber wing, and two intermediate shapes under one-third load and two-thirds load,
respectively.
2. The aerodynamic efficiency of these aerofoil whE'n used together with a standard
aerofoil in biplane and triplane combinations.
3. The stability of these biplane and triplane combinations.
Models of the necessary aerof011s were made of bakelite and were correct to within fiVf'
one-thousandths of an inch. The model of R. A. F. 6, which was used as the standard section,
was of wood, and though accurate when made did not retain its accuracy as woll as the bakelite
models.
The stream-line and full-lifting aerofoils were designed in accordance with certain limitations
imposed by the rib structure. The chief of these were:
1. The necessity for a blunt nose to permit the front spar being placed at the leading edge.
2. In the lifting model a lower surface concave toward the trailing edge could not be u cd
beeause the portion of the rib behind the rear spar does not change shape and the stroam line
is slightly conVex.
3. The camber of the lower surface between the spar wa limited by the necessity of
allowing for internal bracing wires.
4. The maximum camber on the upper surface was determincd by the camber of the lower
and by the thickness of the aerofoil, which, in turn, was dE'termined by the fineness dl' ired
in the stream line.
The two extreme shapes were carefully design d in the light of these and of aerodynamical
considerations. The intermediate shapes w re obtained on the assumption that the rib
deflected throughout its length directly as the load up to normal full load. Control can he
exercised over the design of these intermediate shapes by 'varying the depth of the flanges of
the rib channels, but as the distribution of pressure is also a factor and as it is not known how
much the distribution assumed (R. A. F. 14) differs from the actual, the hapes usrd wcr'
arrived at somewhat arbitrarily.
The wind tunnel used at the Bureau of Standards is of 54-inch octagonal section, the ail'
being drawn through by a IOO-horsepower motor. The balance is of the N. P. L. type and the

models Wtre mounted vertically in the tunnel. In the biplane and triplane combinations
ion
the models were spaced relatively by brass struts screwed into the ends. ProviB was made
for a fine adjustment of the decalage by the arrangement illustrated in figure ~'. The points
of attachment of the struts to the variable planes corresponded approximately with the positions
of the spar in the full- ize wing. The leading edge was thus fixed in position, so no adjustment
for gap was necessary. The chord of the fixed middle aerofoil was used as a roferenc plane,
and the decal age measured by the difference in gap at the trailing edge.
Lift, drag, and torque determinations were carried out on the following aerofoils and
combinations:

DISCUSSION OF WI D-TUN EL RESULT
81 GLE AEROFOILS.

The curves for the variable wing as a monoplane (fig. 8) were obtained from figures 14, 15 ,
and 16. At low angle (-3 °, - 2°; -1 °,0°), when the variable wing was stream line, the points
for the variable curves were obtained from the curves for V. C. S. At high angles (12°, 14°,
16°, 17°, 18°), when it was in its full lifting shape, the points from V. C. L. were used. Two in·
termediate sets of points were obtained-one from the curve for V. C. t L. at 4" and the other
from the V. C. ~ L. curves at 8°.

The travel of the center of pressure is noteworthy, being as nearly as possible stationarythe amount of travel within the range of flying angles being 0.035 chord in the stable direction.
Aerofoils of the fixed type are unstable. Thus, if the center of pressure coincides with the
center of gravity at any angle within the flying range, the plane will be in equilibrium. If,
however, it is then displaced from this angle, the position of the center of pressure will change
and will introduce an upsetting moment which will move the plane still further from its position
of equilibrium. This unstable effect is very marked at small angles of incidence. This is apparent from figure 16, the curves for V. C. t L., ·V. C. ~ L., and V. C. L. being typical of all ordinary aerofoils. In figure 8 the motion of the center of pressure is such that if the plane be displaced from its angle of equilibrium the resulting moment will tend to bring it back to that
position. At 17° a marked change occurs, but this is evidently due to the breakdown in the
air flow which takes place at that angle, and which is also noticeable in the lift and drag
curves. The individual curves (figs. 14, 15, and 16) are characteristic for the particular types
of aerofoils, though the intermediate shapes are somewhat inefficient when compared with
other aerofoils of similar camber.
The drag curve (fig. 15) shows that the minimum resistance of the stream-line plane is less
than one-third that of the lifting plane. These are the figures for the models at the tunnel
speed of 50 miles per hour. In a full-size machine, traveling at 150 miles per hour, the minimum drag would be about one-quarter. This improvement at high speed is due to the fact
that the drag of an aerofoil is made up of two parts~the direct head resistance, which increases
as the square of the speed, and the skin friction, which increases a,t a lesser rate. The drag of a
stream-line body is mostly skin friction, while that of a heavily-cambered aerofoil is nearly all
direct head resistance. Variable camber, therefore, gives us a wing having the high lift coefficient of V. C. L. with the objectionable high minimum drag of such a wing cut down by 75
per cent.
BIPLANES.

The first biplane series, with the variable wing for the upper plane and with the negative
stagger, shows excessive stability. The vector diagram (fig. 11) was obtained by assuming a
center of pressure travel by plotting a curve through the appropriate points in figure 19. Up
to 2~· 0 the variable plane is stream line, at 4~0 it is assumed to be one-third lifting, at 8° to be
two-thirds lifting, and 12° to be full lifting.
If the planes were attached to the machine so that the center of gravity was situated at a
point on the vector for 2°, and slightly above the lower plane, the arrangement would be stable
under all conditions. Thus, if the incidence was increased to 18°, a moment would come into
play tending to reduce the incidence, while if it was reduced to 0°, the resulting moment would
cause it to be increased. Even in the abnormal po ition represented by the vector for -1 °
there would still be a correcting moment to bring the machine back to its position of equilibrium.
The stability in the case of this biplane is excessive by reason of the correcting moment being
too great. There seems no reason why a more satisfactory arrangement should not be obtained
with a stagger of 10 or 15 per cent. Forward stagger with this combination, however, would
cause very serious instability, as would back stagger in the second biplane arrangement.
This second series, with the lower plane the variable one, and the top plane staggered 20
per cent forward , is very satisfactory. The vector diagram (fig. 12) shows sufficient but not.
excessive stability, with all the vectors passing practically through a point midway betweell
the planes. The lift cunes (fig. 20) are regular, and show no serious falling off at the burble
point. No.8, which is the landing-speed combination, is particularly satisfactory in this
respect, having a flat top for 6°. Even after 20°, where the flow does break down , there
is a complete absence of the abrupt change which is apparent in the curve for the variable
wing as a monoplane. The lift/drag curve (fig. 21) bring out very dearly the advantages of

SUMMARY.

l. Th variable camber wing has a maximum lift coefficient of 0.76 (absolute) and a minimum drag of 0.0070. It has a stable travel of the center of pre ure of 0.035 of the chord (fig. 8).
2. At the wind tunnel speed of 30 miles an hour, it minimum drag is less thiLn one-third
the minimum drag it would have if the full lifting shape were to be u cd at small angles of incidence (fig. 15). Under full-size conditions thi would be about a quarter.
3. When used in a biplane, the lift/drag i doubled at peed in exces of 2.1 times th('
landing peed, and trebled at three times the landing peed. , imilar results were ohtained
in a tl'iplane (figs . 9 and 10).
4. A biplane with 20 per cent forward stagger show satisfacLory stability in the platlef'
them elve. A biplane with 20 per cent back stagger. and a triplane combination show somewhat exce~ sive tability (figs. 11, 12, and 13).
5. The devi e involve changes in the ribs only.

REPORT No. 78.
THE LIMITING VELOCITY IN FALLING FROM A GREAT HEIGHT.
By EDWIN BIDWELL WIL ON.

l. The fundamen tal characteristic of the vertical motion und er gravity in a .ceSIstlll!!
medium is the approach to a final or limiting velocity U, whether the initial downward velocity
i less or o-reatel' than U. The equation of motion are ea ily et up and integrated when the
density of the medium is constant and the resistance varies as the quare of the velocity.
A fact not 0 much tre sed is the lowne s of the approach to the limiting velocity U.
For example thl? simple r elation v 2 = 2gh, which neglects altogether the re istan ce of the atmosphere, sho w t' at the height h of r elease from rest mu t be about 10,000 feet before the object
will attain a velocity of as mu h a 00 ft. / ec. even without the opposition of the air r esistance;
and when allowance is mad e for that resistance the height mu t be greater. If, therefore,
terminal velocities of 900 or more feet per econel, such a are cu tomary with airplane bombs,
are under con icleration, it i only in tp.e case of fall from a great h eio-ht (upward of 10,000
feet) that the terminal velocity can be anywhere nearly approached.
Here, however, another difficulty enters. The resistance of the ail' varie with the density
of the medium and this variation should not be a umed a priori to b e negligible in the case of
fall from heights of upward of 2 mile. Tn the tandard table of den itie at different levels,
t he ratio pi Po of the den ity at altitude h to that at the earth ha become about 0.74 at 10,000
feet, 0.62 at 15,000, and 0.44 at 25,000 . The que tion thus arise a to whether the changing
resistance of the air may be taken into account in orne sa tisfactorily imple way for the discus ion of vertical fall.
It is the purpose of this report to give that si.mple treatment of the problem which I have
in the pa t offered to my lasses at the Ma achusett Institute of Technology; there are
undoubtedly other solu tion , perhap equally imple or simpler, but I have een none .

ow, as the exponential of F (multiplie'd by a constant) must be integrated, it is advisable
to have a logarithmic expres ion to give the runpirical relation between hand F. Try:
F(h) = b log. (1 +ah).

This holds for h = 0 and has two disposable constants a and b. A lea t-squares solution could
be made to determine the be t ,alues for a and b; but a sufficiently good result may be had
by passing the curve through or near two se~s of values in the table:
Fl=blog (1+ah 1 ), Fz=blog (l+ah z ):
Fj:Fz=log (l+ah l ): log (l+ah z), l +a hl=(l+ahzV"F,
Let h z = ,000. Then F z =7 .6. Lot F I =2Fz =15.36. Then hi is just under 20,000 and
may be taken as hi = 19,000 by interpolation. Hence
1 +19,000 a= (1 +8000 a)z= 1 + 16,000 a +64,000,000 (lz
and
Whence b = 24.1.

a = 3/64,000.

Thus
F(h) = 24.1 loa. (1 + 3h/64,000) = 55.5 loglo (1 + 3h/64,000).

.5. The formulas thus obtained should not be applied to calculate velocities which are large
compared with that of sound . It is generally admitted that the simple square law of resistance
does not hold for velocities much in excess of 800 ft. /sec. Just how well the law holds below
that figure may till be con idered doubtful; but two recent authorities (E. Vallier, Balistique
Extcrieure, Encyclopedie des Sciences Mathematiques, tome IV, Vol. 6, fasc. 1, p. 15, Gauthierillars, Paris, 1913; and J. Pre cott, London, Phil. Mag. , er. 6, vol. xx, p. 332, Oct. 1917)
seem to feel tolerably certain of the law for compact shell-like bodies up to 00 ft ./sec. It was
seen at the start that irre pective of air resistance, such a velocity would not be obtained from
res t in a fall of 10,000 feet. If U = 1,200, the velocity of 00 ft.jsec. will be reached at the earth's
surface onl'y when the fall is through some 15,000 feet. (Whether high velocities might not be
attained at intermediate levels is a que tion that should not be overlooked.)
6. It is often s tated, as is indeed obvious, that a body falling in a medium of increasing
density such as the air may reach a maximum velocity alld be subsequently retarded before
striking the earth. The terminal velocity toward which the body strives is of course greater at
higher levels. The question of reaching a maximum velocity is therefore a ques tion of balance
between the height of fall and the natural resistance of the body relativo to its weight. A
body of high terminal velocity (in standard. air) mu t fall from a very great height in order to
attain a maximum greater than the speed with which it reaches the earth, whereas a body of low
terminal velocity need not fall so far.
The maximum velocity of a body falling from res t is obtained by differentiating

The derivative of an integral with respect to the lower limit is the negative of the integrand

REPORT No. 79.
BOMB TRAJECTORIES.
By EDWIN BIDWELL WILSON.

I. INTRODUCTORY.

The trajectory of a bomb of high terminal velocity dropped from a great altiLude su ch as
30,000 feet requires a eomplicated analy i much like that for the trajectory of a shell fired at a
high angle. For, in the fir t place, the changing den it~T of the air can not be wholly ignored,
and in the seeond place, the air resi tance a a function of the velocity is exceedingly complicated.
and, in particular, as the bomb may pass through the velocity of sound in air, all sorts of complications leading even to instability and tumbling, which render any calculation of the trajectory
illusory, may be present.
I have pointed out in a previous note on the Limiting Velocity of Free Fall that bomb of
high terminal velocity mu t faU over 10,000 feet and acquire a velocity of 800 ft. / ec., that
bombs of lower terminal velocity must fall through even greater di tances, and that there i
tolerable agreement among balli ticians that up to velocities of about 800 ft./see., the simple
square law of resistance (R <X v 2 ) holds for solid shell-like bodies. The problem which I wish
to treat here i that of the trajectory of a bomb launched horizontally when the fall is not so
great that the velocity exceed 00 ft./sec., at any point of the path. Only the first approximation founded on the assumption of constant air density will be developed.
II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

This problem has been treated in sGveral ways in an elementary manner, e. g., by E. L .
Gayhart in " Aviation, " Volume III, J o. 12, January 15,1918, pages 19-822, after the German
by Ernest Hemkel. My di cussion, likewi e elementary, i that which I have given student~
of aeronautical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and which may be
of interest to others.
If Vbe the velocity in path, u, v the component velo ities horizontal and vertical downward,
respectively, U the terminal velocity, tho resistance is R = k VZ = 1VVZ/ U2 pound, where 1V is the
mass. The equations of motion are

according as the motion is referred to rectangular axes or to the tangent and normal to the path
(radius of curvature=r).
The second of (2) may be written

Vdd~=9(1- &; ~}
and compared with the equation for vertical fall in which V =V. For the trajectory V/v is
always greater than unity and hence tho incroase of V with the vertical drop y is always les
. than the increase of v with v~rtical drop 11 when the fall is itself vert.ical. In other words, in

The rea oning hows that £01' all practical purpose one may (;on id er that a velocity on a

and since e2gS/ U'> 1, it follovvs at once from (4) and (4') that, for a given horizontal trayel x,
a bomb will fall farther in the air than in vacuo-or, for a given drop h, a bomb will fall short
in the air as compared with it position in vacuo. (This woull seem to be self-evident, but
H emkel, as tran lated by Gayhart in "Aviation," cit. su:)., states that "the paradox may
ari e that becau e of resistance the bomb will travel farther in the air than if in a vacuum"fl. remark that I do not understand. )
IV. THE PARABOLA.

If axe be taken at the starting point, the trajectory in vacuo is the parabola

y = gx 2 o2= 1/2 mx2 if m = g/U02 •
/'2u
This is the first approximation for the trajectory.
The arc of the parabola y = 1/2 mx2 may be obtained as a series, namely,
s=

I X +m2x2dx= I
../1

(1 +1/2 m 2x2+ - ___ ) dx=x+1/6 m 2 3 + _ -_ .
x

The approximation is good as long as mx is mall relative to 1; it becomes bad as mx near 1,
and for mx> 1 the seriesdivergcs. Nowm=g/u o2. If Uo is as high as 1 0 ft. / ec., m is as small
as 1/1000, and the horizontal tra,el may be se,eral hundred feet before s diil'ers much from x.
If, however, the airplane be moving at only 115 it. /sec., 'U o2 = 13,200, m=g/uo2 =1/400, and the
horizontal travel can hardly exceed 300 feet before s becomes considerably dillerent from x.
As mx is the quantity determining the degree of approximation, the equation 11 = 1/2 mx2 may
best be written as y = (mx)x/2, from which it is seen that the drop in vacuo can only be a few
hundred feet at best if mx is to remain small. For these small drops the trajectory in air does
not depart appreciably from that in vacuo.
V. THE SECOND APPROXIMATION.

The departure from the parabola for moderate drops may be calculated by integrating (4)
with =x.

The expan ion may be reverted so that x appears as a series in 11 1/2.

is to converge rapidly and be ·valuable. K ow, with reference to the parabolic ( rst) approxi2
mation, gx/U0 ='2y/x; and hence it is inferred that the series expansion (7) is not valid except
when 2y/x is not large, i. e., when y is not more than a few hundred feet. In fact, a comparison
shows that the fourth term in (7) is equal to the second term, which is identical with the cor2
rection in (5), when gx/U0 = 4.5. In the case of a machine for which Uo= 100, x = 1,400. If (7)
held good for such large valuE's of x, it would be valid up to drops of some 3,000 feet. This
would be very satisfactory, hut there is no assurance that the subsequent terms in (7) will be

proved to hold. For instance, if u o =200, U=800, y=2,000, then -Llx=96 feet, as figured
from (9), is likely to be a fair correction; but if U o = 100 it is doubtful whether (9) would be good
up to values of y as gren,t as 2,000.
VII. A FOURTH APPROXIMATION.

One way in which to get an estimate of the true trajectory is to shut it in between two
curves, one above, the other below it. Clearly x<s<x+y . When x is small the relative
approach of s to x is close; when s is larger the relative approach to x + y is fairly good. Moreover, y<s .

This curve leads to the approximation (5) as a special case. It has, however, but small relation
to the general features of a long trajectory. The broad fundamental feature of a long trajectory
i that the projectile drops vertically at the end, i. e., the trajectory has an asymptote. Obviously, (13) shows no asymptote; every value of x yields a finite value of y.
VITI. A FIFTH APPROXIMATION.

The second equation may be integrated by the u ual device of introducing the variable

when y is large and the curve is nearly vertical. The curve shows an asymptote at x = 7ruo
The true trajectory can not have an asymptote any farther from the origin. If uo = 100 and
V=800, the total limiting forward travel of the bomb can not therefore be more than 4,000
feet. The asymptotic di tance varies directly with both U o and V. It is in the case of a light
object, such as a tennis ball, that the existence of the asymptote is most easily observed.
The correction for forward carry from the parabola to (14) is an underestimate because
the true trajectory lies below (14) and consequ ently nearer the y axis. This correction is

(15)

If u o=200, V=800, y=2,000, as in the previous illustrative case, the correction (an under-

estimate) is 38 feet as compared with 96, the accuracy of which is unknown. The very different
forms of (9) and (15) as functions of U o are noteworthy.
If y=2,000, the value of x from (14) is 2,199. For this value of x the value of y in (13),
which also undercorrects the parabola, is ea iest found from the series

V4

which avoids the subtraction of nearly equ al large numbers. The value of y i 2,082; hence
(13), which lies too high, lies lower than (14) by 2 feet in this case and gives a better trajectorj.
This might have been expected from the fact that when y is not too large relative to x, s is much
nearer to x than to y and (10) must lie nearer the true trajectory than (ll) .
.
Now the correction for carry may be founa for (13 ) in this manner. This curve lies 2
feet lower than (14) when X= 2,199 and its slope is nearly 2. The correction from (14) to (13)
is therefore 41 feet, which, added to 38, gives 79 as the correction from the parabola as compared
with 96 from (9).

value in (16) . Then y=2,05 and exceeds 2,000 by 5 feet. A the slope is about 2, thi
means an additional correction of about 30 feet to x=2,12. The r e ult is that x lies b etween
2,128 and 2,15 feet under these conditions. The approximation (9) gave the value x= 2,141almost the mean, but this may be accidental.
X. SUMMARY.

It has been hown that when a bomb i launched from an airplane the veloci ty of 00
ft ./sec. will not be attained before the bomb has fallen a di tance practically equal to that
required for attaining the same velocity in vertical fall from re t. Formula (6) and (9) have
been derived for the forward carry (or its correction related to the parabola) in ca e the vertical
fall is only a few hundred feet, but neither formula can be expected to apply when y is larger
than x. Three approximate trajeetorie (13), (14), (16) have been derived. The true trajectory lie below (13 ) and (14 ) and above (16 ). Curve (14) and (16) resemble the tru e trajectory in showing a verti al a ymptote, but until y considerably exceed x the non-a ymptotic
form (13 ) is a better appro. imation than (14) . For an initial velocity a high a 200 ft./ ec.
and a terminal velo city a Iowa 00 it./sec. the correction from the parabola is not great
(about 100 ft.) in a drop of 2,000 feet, and the correction is known to within about 15 feet.

REPORT No. 80.
STABILITY OF THE PARACHUTE AND HELICOPTER.
By

H.

BATEMAN.

INTRODUCTION.

This paper was submitted to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics by
Professor H. Bateman, of the California Institute of Technology, and its publication duly
authorized by the committee as Technical Report o. 80.
The mathematical theory of the stability of a parachute which is symmetrical with respect
to a plane is very similar to the well-known theory of the stability of an airplane, but the values
of the resistance coefficients are naturally different. When the parachute does not rotate, it
may be compared with an airplane in a straight dive. There are oscillations corresponding to
the longitudinal and lateral oscillations, and these are practically independent of one another.
Thus, when the parachute swings like a pendulum as it descends, we have an oscillation corresponding to the pitching of an airplane, while there is another type of oscillation which corresponds to the Dutch roll.
When the parachute is symmetrical about an axis, so that it has the form of a solid of revolution, there may be no banking in the oscillation con-esponding to the Dutch roll, and the
oscillation then becomes a simple swing like the one which corresponds to the pitching of an
airplane. In this case a combination of two simple swings in perpendicular planes may give rise
to a compound oscillation, which may be likened to the motion of a conical pendulum falling
under gravity. In the general case the combination of the simple swing and Dutch roll gives
rise to a compound motion of a complicated character.
ANALYTICAL DISCUSSION.

To discuss the matter analytically we shall write down the equations of motion in the
notation used by G. H. Bryan \ and S. Brodetsky.2 We shall take the axis of y as axis of symmetry and assume that in the steady tate the parachute is falling with velocity V in a vertical
direction, which coincides with the axis of y, and is rotating with angular velocity Q around the
axis of y. This last assumption is made for the sake of generality, so as to cover the case of a
rotating solid of revolution and to obtain a condition corresponding to some extent with the case
of the helicopter where the longitudinal and lateral oscillations are not independent. The
equations of motion may be written in the form

[~~+ (Q+q)w-r(V+v)J= WsinO-X,

Here W is the weight of the parachute and passenger, X, Y , Z , L, M,
the component
air forces and couples referred to axes fixed in the parachute, B is the moment of inertia about
the axis of symmetry, A the moment of inertia about a perpendicular axis through the center
of gravity, both measured in gravitational unit , U + u, v, W , p, Q + q, r are component velocities
and spins in the disturbed motion. To obtain the direction of the axes in space in a disturbed
position of the parachute we suppose the parachute rotated first about the axis of y (from z to x)
through an angle "', then about the axi of z (from x to y ) through an angle 0, anq finally about
the axis of x (from y to z) through an angle cp.
Let us write u+iw=/L, p+ir=b, cp + iO = x where i denotes -1 , then since u, w , p, 1' , 0,
and cp are small in a small oscillation and the parachute is symmetrical about the axis of y, we
may write to a:first approximation

X +iZ = /LE + bF
L + iN = /LJ + bK

where' the generalized resistance coefficients E, F , J , K are complex quantities.
The above equations imply that if E = E1 + iE2' etc. ,

It is on account of the e relation that the analy i for the symmetrical parachute is
simpler than that for an airplane in a straight drive. If, in fact, we neglect squares of small

quantities and use D to denote the operatore
form

~

Seeking a solution of the form /L=/LoeAt,

the first four equations may be written in the

x=xoeAt

we obtain the period equation

J[1X K+iQB~A)xJ -iJ [( :V-iF)x+ WJ=o.
2+(

[:(X~Q) +E

This is a cubic equation

with complex coefficients for the determination of X. When Q = 0 it reduces to a cubic
equation with real coefficients for we have the relations E2= 0, F1 = 0, J 1= 0, K2= o.
Remembering that in the general case of a rigid airplane the oscillations about a state
of steady motion are determined by an algebraic equation of the eighth degree, we infer that
in the present degenerate case our real cubic is a double factor of the octic and the periods and
decrements are the same for simple swings in two perpendicular planes through the axis of
symmetry of the parachute.
When Q = 0 a root X= IX +i{J for which IX is negative and (J positive implies the existence
of a damped oscillation in which the center of gravity of the parachute describes a curve on a
vertical cylinder in such a way that it moves in a counterclockwise direction when the axes
are left handed. To see this we notice that u+iw is of the form
Rea (t-t.. )

[cos (J(t-to) +i sin {J(t-to)J

where R and to are real quantities. This equation indicate that

STABILITY OF THE PARACHUTE AND HELICOPTER.

the axis of z is to the left of the axis of x, the axi of y being downwards, this means that the
center of gravity moves on the cylinder in the counterclockwise direction.
The equation 4> +i(} = X oe (a+i{3l t implies that at the same time the axis of symmetry precesses around the vertical in the counterclockwise direction. If we disregard the vertical motion
the character of the oscillation may be pictured by imagining a cone representing the parachute to partly roll and partly slide on the out ide of another cone whose axis is vertical.
Let us call this a positive oscillation and use the term negative oscillation to denote one
in which f3 is negative and the two motions take place in the clockwise direction.
Either a positive or negative oscillation can be regarded as built up from two simple
swings in perpendicular planes, the two swings having the same period and damping time,
but differing in phase by a quarter period. By combining two such swings with an arbitrary
difference in phase a type of elliptic oscillation is obtained.
It should be noticed than an undamped positive oscillation may correspond to a new type
of steady motion of the parachute. If such a motion exist it is characterized by v=o, q =o
and the fact that the cubic equation has two purely imaginary roots.
Thus cubic equation may be written in the form
where

Let A2 - 2aA+ () be a factor of the cubic, then a and () are determined by the equations
4a 2- () + 2ay + xw =

0

-2a(}-y(}+x=o.

With the aid of these equations we can plot the curves t = constant in the (x, y) plane.
Since
(4~2+2ay+xw) (y+2a) =X
a curve t=con tant (a=constant) is a hyperbola.

When a=O it reduces to x=o, y= .!... and
w

this is a boundary of the region of stability in the (x,y) plane.

The condition for undamped

oscillations is, moreover, either x = 0 or y = 1.

In Figure I the curves t=constant have been drawn for two different values of w .
It will be seen that when w = .25 the time of damping t is generally greater than the period.
This is sometimes the case even when w = .5, but by choosing x and y in a suitable m anner it is
possible to make p greater than t. The importance of a fairly large value of w is thus m anifes t .

be fairly low, and there seems no way of
avoiding this except perhaps by attaching a
ring-shaped balloon to the rim of the disk.
The upward thrust on the balloon and the
.downward force through the center of gravity
would then have as their resultant a force
acting through a point lower than the center
of gravity, and this point would act as the
center of gravity of the parachute in the
usual theory.

STABILITY OF THE PARACHUTE AND HELICOPTER.

The effect on a negative oscillation is to increase both the period and the time of damping.
The effect on a simple subsidence is to make it periodic' and increase the time of damping.
The effect of rotation when !T and T are not both positive is easily inferred.
In order that !To, !T1I !T2 may all be negative and the damping times for the three disturbances associated with ,{o, a l +i(3l1 at -i(3, all increased, it is necessary, but not sufficient, that
QG, QI, and Qj2 should all be positive.
J ow Nu = J 0+ Qj2' hence it is necessary in the first
place that the effect of the rotation should be to increase N u • The effect on the period is of
some interest because in gen.eral the single period and time of damping associated with the
two conjugate roots at +i(31 and at -iBlI will give rise to two different periods and two different
times of damping; also a new positive or negative oscillation with a long period will arise from
the simple subsidence associated with the root Ao. The phenomenon of the division of one
period into two is somewhat analogous to that which occurs in the Zeeman effect, especially
as we may have a compound oscillation built up from positive and negative circular oscillations of nearly equal period. The curves in Figure II give the horizontal projection of the
path of the center of gravity of the parachute or helicopter in two particular cases of compound oscillations of the above type. In the
first case the two component circular oscillations are undamped, in the second case they
are both damped, the rate of subsidence being
the same in each case. A complete discussion of the effect of rotation on stability is
out of the question at present owing to our
lack of knowledge of the values of the various
resistance coefficients, but it may be worth
while to ascertain the conditions for stability
by finding the conditions that a cubic equation with complex coefficients may have roots
FIG. II.
whose real parts are all negative.
The conditions that a cubic equation with complex coefficients may have the real parts of all
its roots negative.
The method given by E. J. Routh I for finding the conditions that an algebraic equation
with real coefficients may have the real parts of all its roots negative may be extended to the
case of an equation with complex coefficients.
• Let us consider the case of the cubic

(XT at) (x+ (2) (x+ as)=x s + px 2+ qx+r=x3 + (Pt +ip2)X2+ (ql +iq2)x+rl +ir2
Let al=xl+iYlI a2=x2+iY2' as=xs+iys, and let the equation whose roots are -xl+iYI,
-xl +iY2' -xs+iys, be
(x+.B 1) (x+.B l ) (x+.Bs)=xs+Pxl+Qx+R.
In Routh's method the first step is to write iy for x and to separate the real and imaginary
parts of the cubic, thus obtaining two expressions

yS + P2y2 - qlY - r2=ft (Y)
PIy2+qly-rl =t;(y)
The process of finding the greatest common measure offt (Y) andh (y) must now be carried
out, the sign of the remainder being changed at each step just as in Sturm's theorem. In this
way we obtain a series of polynomials whose first coefficients are

and K should aU be positive. The quantity K becomes zero when anyone of the quantities
XII X2 , Xs becomes zero, it corresponds, therefore, to Routh's discriminant in the case of the
real quartic. In terms of XII X2 , xs, Yll Y2' Ys, the expressions for Hand K are
H = AX2XS + BXSXI + Ox IX2, '
H 2K=X lX2XS [H2_ (lO-nA) (mA-lB) - (mA-lB) (nB-mO) - (nB-mO) (lO-nA)]

where

A

= (x 2 +xs) (2x l + X2 +xs) + (Y2 _Ys)2,
B= (Xs+x l ) (2x 2+xS +xJ + (YS-Yl)2,
0= (Xl +X2) (2xs +xl +x2) + (Yl -Y2)2,
l=X l (Y2-YS ), m=x2(Ys-Yl)' n=xs (YI-Y2)'

It is not evident from these expressions that XII X2 , and Xs are positive when PII H, and K
are positive;t also H2 K is of the eleventh degree in the quantities XII X2 , XS' Yll Y2' Ys, and is not
the simplest function of the coefficients which becomes zero when one of the quantities XII X21
Xs is zero; consequently it will be worth while to :find an alternative set of conditions which
will make XII X2 , and Xs positive.
Let us consider the expressions

REPORT No. 81.
COMPARISON OF UNITED STATES AND BRITISH STANDARD PITOT-STATIC TUBE£,
By A. F.

ZAHM

and R. H.

SMITH.

PREFACE.

It has been stated by some experimenters that the standard pitot-static tube used by t.he
United States avy does not, at all airplane speeds, give the same differential pressure as the
British standard pitot-static tube. Since the readings of these two tubes form the basis of
comparison of a part of the British and American aerodynamic data, it was deemed advisable
to calibrate them with reference to one another at all available wind tunnel speeds. This was
accomplished in the 8 by 8 foot tunnel constricted to 4 by 4 feet and giving a fairly uniform air
flow at all speeds up to 160 miles an hour. The table and illustrations were prepared by Mr.
G. C. Hill.
DESCRIPTION OF TUBES.

Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4 give the general exterior appearance of these instruments and the structural drawings of their nozzles. In shape both nozzles consist of round coaxial tubes terminating in a hollow conical nose with fine external taper as shown in the figures. The avy
tube has the steeper taper and the greater number of static holes in the external pipe. The
holes in both are 0.040 inch in diameter. Both nozzles are attached to stream-line shanks
which convey the static and impact pressures, respectively, to the opposite leads of their
manometers or pressure gauges. The theory and general structure of such tubes are too well
known to require detailed explanation.
MANNER OF TESTING.

During calibration the tubes were placed abreast in the 4 by 4 foot tunnel, equally distant
from each other and from the walls, and supported from their shanks which ran vertically
upward through the ceiling of the tunnel to liquid alcohol manometers having a 1 to 5 slope.
Vibration was prevented by a fine wire attached to the lower ends of the shanks and to the
side walls. During the test the British tube was made to read even miles per hour from 20 to
160, by increments of 10, and the corresponding pressure difference for the other tube was
observed at the same instant, at the time when both readings were steady. After a complete
and careful run, duly checked, the tubes were interchanged in position, and a complete new
run was taken with the British tube still made the instrument of reference. The mean of the
speed indications of the J avy tube, observed at anyone speed in the two positions, was taken
as the true reading, or what would be obtained in a uniform and homogeneous current.
By means of a hook gauge, the two manometer tubes were calibrated to 0.001 of an inch of
water simultaneously and under the same pressure, allowance being made for the descent of
the alcohol in their reservoirs. As seen from Table I and Fig. 5, the two straight glass tubes
of the inclined manometer were of uncommonly uniform diameter, except where a weld in
each tube was made during construction. Both were of German glass 3/16 of an inch in
diameter. The meniscus could be located accurately to 0.01 of an inch along the tube, or
1/500 of an inch in vertical displacement, thus enabling the differential pressure in the nozzles
to be read truly to less than 1 per cent at 20 miles per hour and still more accurately at higher
speeds.

RESULTS.

Fig. 6 gives the final calibration data for the two tubes. When the corrected air speed indications of the United States T avy tube are plotted to the same linear scale, against those of
the British tube, as a basis of reference, the data all lie on a straight line who e slope is unity.
It had been alleged that the somewhat steeper cone of the Tavy nozzle caused too low pre sure
in the static holes. From this diagram, how'ever, it appears that the air speed readings of the
two instruments are identical to the accuracy of inclicaLion of either instrument.
REMARK.

It seems most desirable that a standard pitot-static tube be accurately calibrated at all
peeds used in aerodynaInic research. The precise calibrations thus far made have stopped far
short of the speeds available in modern wind tlIDnels and aircraft.

With each delivery of a new type or size of airplane the manufacturer furnishes (1) the
data and (2) the computations by which to judge the performance and safety of the machine.
Under " data" may be classed the geometrical dimensions of thc entire craft and its
parts; the physical properties of its materials, both raw and as treated for final use, find a
description of the method of treatment of these materials; the measured strengths of the
whole structure and of its elements; the weight schedule, giving the mass and position of the
structural parts and of the carried loads; the aerodynamic properties of the sustaining and
control urfaces, the body, the undercarriage, and the craft as a whole; the records of insp('ction and full-scale test, etc. To this must be added much special information about the
engine, the propeller, the navigating instruments, etc.
Under II computations" may be furnished information as to the stresses and performance

The present work, intended as a handbook, covers primarily the theory of airplane stress
analysis, but ignores, as foreign to its scope, the forces within the engine and propeller. It
presents analytical methods and formulas with little if any argument, assuming the reader
can supply the proofs or will not require them. All the formulas are illustrated by problems
given immediately in the text and solved in Chapter IV.

INTRODUCTION.

This re;)ort was prepared at the Aerodynamical Laboratory, Navy Yard, Washington,
D. C., by direction of Rear Admiral D. W. Taylor, Chief Constructor, U. S. Navy, and Member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, for publication in the committee's
Fifth Annual Report.
1. TERMINOLOGY.

The mechanical terms in this text bear the same meaning as in standard works on applied
mechanics; the aeronautical terms, where practicable, follow the nomenclature published in
1917 by the United tates National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (Report No. 25).
Some words not so published are used of nece ity, and when of uncertain meaning are defined
upon their fu'St. appearance in the text. For example, "air force " for the re ultant of air pressure and friction. A an abbreviation for" angle of incidence," the term "incidence" is sometimes used in this text, as is commonly done in aerodynamic works.
2. UNITS AND DIMENSIONS.

For the most part in this text ordinary British units are employed. The unit of mass is
sometimes the pound; sometimes the slug, or g pounds, g being the acceleration of gravity.
The standard of air density is taken as 0.07635 pound, or 0.00238 slug, per cubic foot, or
that of dry air at 760 m. m. and 15.6° C. Hence the familiar full impulse p V2, per unit cross
section of a jet, is 0.00238 P pound per square foot when V is feet per second, or 0.0051 V2 when
V i miles an hour. .\.nd the air force on a normal smface of A square feet i R = 0.0023 OA V2
pounds at V feet per second, a being a dimensionless multiplier, called the "shape coefficient,"
or "absolute coeilicient "-a constant independent of the system of units.!
3. NORMAL AND ABNORMAL LOADS.

Structurally an airplane is under normal load in two notable cases: (1) On earth when
restinG' naturally on a level surface; (2) in air when in teady straightaway !light at any incidence. 2 In these cases the external applied forces, whether due to air, earth, or motor, are
constant and in algebraic sum equal to the weight of the craft. Some may be positive, others
negative.
In all other conditions the loading i abnormal and may be either constant or not; either
uniformly increased or not; either po iLi,e or negati,e. For example, an airplane in steady
night around a level circular course bears a con tant load determined by the speed and curvature.
For tlus case the actual load in terms of the normal i tabulated in figure 5. For the large
path cur,es there shown the increa e of loading is ubstantially uniform throughout the
structure. Again the craft may be diving steeply at steady speed and incidence. Then its
loading, both lift and drift, is constant; the fu t smaller than normal, the second larger. When
the machine i tanding on earth some of the loads' are reversed from their direction in air;
when flying inverted all "lift" loads are reversed.
I In 'oneral, tho samo fO
rmula applies toan in 'lined flat su rface whose face area is A. so lon ~ as its incidence and orientation remain constant.
' The loading duc to the ):eneral air stream is illustrated in figs. 1, 2, 3, '1 for a t ypical monoplane surface.

4. SUDDEN LOADS.

lncon tant abnormal load may ari e from sudden change of air speed or incidence, as
in diving, or riding gusts; from motor jerking; from impact against earth l I' water, etc.; and
their change may be uniform throughout the structure or localized; uniform or irregular in
growth and decay. But frequently it uffices to assume that all parts of the tructure sustain
the arne acceleration and hence the same change of load. If this acceleration be 1 at any part
of the airplane, tbe mas e in that part induce stre ses i/[I times tho e due to their weigbt alone,
a uming i and {I in the arne direction.
Wben practicable in engineering te t , an accelerometer should be cn,rried in the acti"Ve
machine to record the component accelerations in Lhe air and on the earth. To find i throughout t,be craft. it i well to u e seyeral accelerometers distributed throughout the tructure.
orne time the acceleration i~ estimated from ob er"Ved 01' a' umed data. For example,
suppo e that a craft, regarded as a single rigid mas in pure tran lation, lands with "Vertical
velocity component v, whose "head" i h=v2j<2rt, and come to rent with uniform eu luoning of
yield d. 1 Then Lhe ratio of its average "Vertical acceleration to gravity is 2

1/[1 = 1 + hjcl.

(1)

It is twice thi amount if, a rarely happens, the cu hion re i tance be 'recLly proportional
to the cusmon deflection d.
Equation (1) is true not only of the macmne as a whole, but of eyery part of it, howe,er
elastic the structure. If tbe craft approach land in pure tran lation, h i the same for all
element, but d varie throughout the structure, being least in tbe chassis parts and greate t
in the parts remote from the impact point·. A like treatment applie t,o iongituclinal and
lateral accelerations.
The assumed maximum acceleration to be provided for in the design of an airplane is
usually specified by the purcbaser.
Example 1.3-If an accelerometer fLxed to an airplane records a maximum vertical acceleration of 4 feet per second, what is the ratio of the abnormal to tbe normal loading ?
Example 2.-An airplane in landing has a v-ertical velocity compo ent of 10 feet pel'
second and a uniform cusmon yield of 6 inches. Find the ratio of the abnormal to the normnl
stresses in the landing gar, assun'llng tbe machine to be a rigid structure
5. SIMPLE STRESSES.

The direct simple stresses here treated are the common tensile, compressive, and shearing
stress s. For each the intensity or unit stress is uniform over the eross seetion and is given by
(2)
S=PjA,
P beinG' the load u taincd by the structural cross section A. For each case the load and tres

outermost fiber is

where ~lI is the torsional moment, c the distance from the center of gravity to the outermost
fiber . .J the polar moment of inertia of the section.
6. I DIRE T SIMPLE STRESSES.

Indirect simple stresse perpendicular to the applied loads occur i transver c and III
torsional loading. In both cases the' longituclina 1 and the transverse shearing tre se at
any point are equal.

In transverse loadiI?-g the tension or compreSSIOn is greatest in the outermost fibers of
the beam and is
(4)
S= Me/I,
where J1 i the bellding moment, I the moment of inertia of the cross section.
In a beam so loaded the longitudinal shearing stress varies over any cross section, being
zero at the remote t fiber and increasing toward the neutral axis of that section. At any
reference axis Y in the section, parallel to the neutral axis, the horizontal shear is
=GC

where a i~ tho sectional area outward {rom Y, C tho distance of the centroid of a from tho
neutral urface , F the total shC'ar ovC'r the entire beam section, and t the thickness of the
bC'am at Y. In mo t, but not all, practical ca es the horizontal hC'ar is a maximum at the
neutral surface. Its value thC'l"P i , for a round beam, 4/3 the mran vertical shear VIA; for a
rectangular one 3 Y /2 A.
Example S.- Find the longitudinal shearing stress in a 4-inch square beam given the total
vertical shear as 1,400 pounds; flr t "vith the diagonal vC'rtical, then with it inclined 45°.
7. RESULTANT UNIT STRESS.

When several causes simultaneou ly produce likr stresses at any point lI1 a structure,
these may be algebraically added.
(a) Endwise stresses due to simultaneous endwise and tmnsverse loads.- Several end'wise
stresses may occur at a point simultaneously. Thus in the lower rear spar of an airplane
the lift produces ten ion, the drag compression; the bending moment produees tension and
compression. The algebraic sum of all these is the effective stress. If P be the aggregate
endwise stress, the above operation is expressed by the following equation,
(6)

S=PjA± MIZ,

in which 111 is the bending moment due to the running load only, z, the section modulus. The
obvious physical meaning of tlus equation is that the first term represents the unit direct stress,
the second tC'rm the unit bending stress, which may be taken either as tensile or compressive.
A more accurate formula for the total endwise unit stress here considered is
(7)

in which cl is the deflection due to J[ only (computed as in figs. 13, 14, 15, 16), and 7c is a
correction factor to be applied to d, because the latter is slightly il1crea cd by P.
If in (6) find (7) PIA i a tensile stress, th succeeding terms can be reduced to "equivalent ten ile stress" by multiplying them by SbISt, or tIl(' ratio of the bending to the ten ile
strength of the material. This is sometimes done "hen Sb differs materially from St. Similarly, when PIA is a comprcssive stre s. The equation (6) ~hen assumes the form
(8)

where S i the equivalent ten ile tress and r is the ratio of the tensile to the bending strength
of the material The equivalent compressive stres is similarly found . .
Formula (6), (7), may be used for wing spars and for non-tapering £lat struts bearing a
considerable side wind pre ure. But if the strut be tapering, S can not be found by fOl'mula
(7) here presented, since d is unknown. However, for normal flying conditions the deflection
is ignorpd, since thefe i no appreciable side wind against the strut.
Example 4.-Find the resultant unit stress in a 2-inch square simple beam, due to an
pndwise load of 900 pounds, a maximum bending moment of 1,100 inch-pounds, and a maximum deflection of 0.05 inch at the place of maximum moment.

(b) Endwise stresses due to simple endwise loads accompanied by bendirlg.- For a uniform
colunm or trut bearing an endwi e load, but no transverse one, the unit Bctual stress in the
outermost fiber is usually found by Rankine's formula
S=L1 + a (l/r)2]p/A ,

(9)

in which P is the actual ndload producing stre es lower than the elastic limit, l is the length
of the strut, r its least radiu of gyration at the center section, and a is a numerical constant
depending on th material, strut form, and manner of constraining the ends. l Values of a
for variou material, forms, and end conditions arc given in books on applied mechanic.
Tf the endwise load is distant p from the column axis the unit stress is
S=[1+a(l/r)2+ cp /rZ] PIA

where c is the distance of the remotest fiber, and l' is the radius of gyration.
EX/7.mple 6.-Fincl the unit stress in a pin-endeel column 1 inch square and 30 inches long
under an axialloac1 of 200 pounds; also the unit stres when taking the eccC'ntricity of the load
as 2 inches.
(c) Oombined shearing and normrzl stress.-' f at any point of a section, S is the normal unit
stress, and Sa the transverse or the equal longitudinal shearing unit stress, then at that point the
maximum resultant shearing stress p, and maximum normal stre s Sn are, respectively
Sp= .,jS.2+ (8/2)2

Example 6.-A beam is subject Lo a compressive unit stress of 200 pounds per square inch
and at the same time to a longitudinal shearing stress of 250 pounds per square inch. ('ompute the maximum resultant stresses.
8. REPETITIVE AND EQUIVALENT STRESS.

When a variable load stresses a member frequently through a fraction m of its elastic
limit, the equivalent steady stress may be taken as
S' =S(1 +m)n
(13)
where is the allowable constant stress, and n is unity for very numerous stress fluctuations,
zero for very few.2
Example 7.-:!.f a member whose allowable constant stre s is 20,000 is stressed frequently
to 15,000 and has an elastic limit of 60,000, what is the equivalent stress?
9. MAXIMUM STEADY LOAD AND STRESS.

For a member subject to uniforrn simple stress the greatest possible load it will sustain is
P=SA
(14)
being the strength of the material, anel A the ectional area of the member. Examples in
airplane construction are: For tension, the tays; for compre ~ion, the hort truts; for shear,
the clevis pins. In all such cases the maximum load and maximum unit sliress occur together.
For a structural element not subject to uniform simple stress the greatest possible load may
exceeel that cau ing the greatest stres. A long strut, for example, may bear a greater endwise
loael and ustain Ie s fiber stress before much bending occurs than when bowed excessively.
For a pin-end eel wooden strut having a slenclemess ratio Z!r, ahove 120, the maximum load
is computed by Euler's formula
(15 )
P max = 7r z EI/l2
where l is the length between pins, I the least moment of inertia of the middle section.
For pin-ended truts with a lower slendernes mtio .Johnson's formula
(16 )

The use 01 formula (9) for computing P mGz is not recommended, formulro (15), (16) giving
better results.

is used J where A is the middle section areaJ 0 the crushing strength of the material J 7c the least
radius of gyration of the middle section. If the strut has very securely fixed ends J the above
two values of P max may be quadrupled.
The crippling load on any strut or column is sometimes given as a function of the slenderness
ratio llT J in tables or diagrams derived from laboratory tests of full scale test pieces.
Example B. - Find the maximum load for a pin-ended spruce column of length 60 inches J
cross section B square inches J and moment of inertia 0.3 inch 4.
10. FACTORS OF SAFETY.

Givell the resultantliber stress intensitYJ this may be divided into an assumed limiting stress
to find the strength- Lress ratio J commonly called the" factor of safety.1> The limiting stress is
determined from standard test pieces of the material and of the structural forms in question.
For each material and form employed in the industrial arts the as umedlimiting stress is commonly fn::ed by agrrement between the consLructor and the purchaser. For staysJ turnbuckles J
fa tenings J etc. J and ometimes for strut - al 0 for entire truss member wingsJ fuselages J etc.the factor of safety is taken as the ratio of the greatest possible load to the greatest actual load
of the member J the former load being found experimentallYJ the latter either by calculation or
by instrumental test under ,,-orking conditions either real or simulated.
Exnmplf g.-Find the factors of saIety in example 6 for a maximum shearing stress of
1J OOO ponnds per square inch J and a maximum compressive stres of 4 J OOO pounds per square
inch; also the factor of safety in example 8 for an appliedloacl of 250 pounds.

AIRPLANE WING STRESSES;
By A. F.

ZAHM.

11. SCOPE OF TREATMENT.

The study of wing stresses may cover in succession the fabric, the ribs, the ailerons, the
spars as beam members, the lift and drag trussing. From the resultant stresses so found
are computed the factors of safety for steady normal flight, taking account of the known
strength of the individual members or of their dimensions and materials.
12. WING FABRIC LOADING AND STRESS.

The tensile stress in the fabric at any point of a wing surface may be computed from the
given curvature and air-pressure distribution at that point. Typical external pressure distributions on a monoplane urface are ho,'ffi in figures 1, 2, 3, and 4. The internal pressure
is sensibly constant and unknown, but with impervious fabric may be made equal to the
external surface pre ure at any point by perforating the canvas there.
At any part of the surface, as in figure 6, let p be the resultant point pressure of the air
in pounds per square foot, a the distance in inches between ribs, and c the depth in inches of
the bulge in the canvas midway between the ribs; then the fabric ten ion t, in pounds per
linear inch, neglecting the effect of the fore and aft curvature, can be sho,'ffi to be approximately

t = 0.000 7 pa 2 jc.
Values of t for variou air pressure and bulging of the fabric are given in figure 6.

(17)

13. RIB LOADING AND STRESS.

The usual airplane rib may be considered as a beam supported at two point (at the spars)
and sustaining the air force on all the fabric lying nearer to itself than to the neighboring ribs.
In figure 7 is shov.-n the distribution of the air force normal to the rib urface and also the
distribution of the components of this air force normal to the chord . The running load on the rib
is not sufficiently uniform to make applicable the ordinary formulas for uniformly loaded beams.
By considering the average loading upon each element of length as a concentrated load
we may compute the hear and moment for a number of points and plot them as in figure .
This proces , however, i laborious.
For approximate treatment we may divide the rib into three part, the egment bet"' een
the spars, the front segment, and the rear segment, and consider the total running load on
each segment as a concentrated load. The magnitude and position of each such load may be
found by well-Imown methods. From these concentrated loads the shear and moment diagrams can be readily drawn, as shown in full line in figure 9, where the dotted lines are superposed from figure 8. The maximum vertical hearing forces are practically the same in bo th
cases, while the maximum negative bending moment in the case of such approximation i abou t
twice that of the true moment and should be halved for the working approximation.
If the concentrllted load on the front and roar egments, as sho,,'n in figure 9, be denoted for
each by R and located at a distance Zfrom the spar, the unit bending stress next to the spar is
S = RZjZ,
(1 )
Z being the section modulus of the cross section of the unsevered part of the rib segment

where it meets the spar.
807

808

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

Again, if R, the concentrated load on the portion of the rib amid spa!'3, is distant a and b
from the front and rear spars, respectively, the unit bending stre s at R i
S=Rab/(a+b)Z,

(19)

Z being the section nodulus there. Dividing S in (19) by 2 give a fair approximation to the
true bending stress for the distributed load .
The rib shearing stress may be found by the shearing stre s formula presented in Part 1.
Example 1.-A rib loaded as in figure 39 has the dimen ions there specified; find the
unit stres es for bending, maximum hearing, and average vertical shearing ju t out ide the
spars and just inside the spars; also the unit bending stress at R between the spars.
14. AILERON LOADING AND STRESSES.

The loads on the aileron are the control-wire pull and the air force . The normal pull may
be taken as the greatest the pilot would care to exert regularly in ilight and is measured with
a spring balance when the pilot seated in a stationary machine vigorou ly plies the control.
The aileron moment equals the control-"\\'ire pull times its eli tance from the aileron hinge
axis; also equals the aileron air force times its di tance from the hinge. If thi latter di tance be assumed of orne rea onable magnitude and be divided into aid moment, it gi,e
the amount of the air force. Sometimes also the air force i e timated from the size, incidence,
and forward speed of the aileron, taken "ith suitable aerodynamic data and with allowance
for the propeller slip stream, if any. In practice, the aileron force may be assumed to be at
the center of the surface and equal to PA, where P is the re ultant pre ure per unit area of
the aileron surface A. The value of P is u ually specified by the purcha cr.
Having thus found either the control-wire pull or the moment of the air force on the
aileron, the stresses may be readily computed from the frame diagram by the usual method
of statics. If the moment of the nil' force tends to twi t the aileron's hinge rod, the unit
stress in the latter is computed by the formula
S= M/Z

(20)

where M and Z are, re pectively, the given moment and the tor ion ection modulus. In thi
ca8e the aileron ribs are simple cantile,ers jutting out from the hinge rod, and are stressed like
the trailing edge of a wing plane, and are treated by the foregoing rib analysis.
Sometimes the control wire pull on an aileron le\or from whose outer end several stays
run to the rear edge of the aileron surface, as shown in figure 38. Each principal aileron rib
then sustains a compre i"e component force duo to the applied stay, a t.rans,erse rnnning air
force, and the tran verse component forces of it outer and its inner end attachment. If only
the trans,erse forces be considered, the aileron rib tress may be calculated by the formula for
the mid egment of a wing rib, as already treated. The endwi e force eames, at any cross section of t.he aileron rib, a compre iYe unit tre s roughly equal to that force divided by the
section area.
The leading and trailing edges of the aileron are treated a continuous heam supported and
loaded as in figure 13.
Example 2.-An aileron bearing a uniform pre sure of 20 pounds per quare foot has the
dimensions and structural form hown in figure 38. Find the moment about the hingo and the
stress in the control wire. Find also the vertical read-ions at tho stay wire upon the trftiling
edge beam.
15. RUNNING LOAD 0

WIN G PLANES

AND SPARS.

The air loaclinO' and weight of a wing plane i in goneral not uniform al ng the whole length
of the plane, but may be taj,en as uniform for each small unit of the length. The actual di tribution of the air loading throughout the length. in a. uniform wind/ is illustrated in figure 4 . For
1 In this text the term "wing" denotes a main supporting n:ember on the right or left of the airplane.
Thus, a biplane wing comprises two wing
planes, the "top plane" and the "bottom plane," joined by "interplane" trussing. Similarly lor a triplane, a quadrupl2ne, a multiplane.
'In casp. a propeller slip stream washes the plane the wind is still less uniform over th plane. '1'0 be "cry a('curate, this case would require
special treatment.

practIcal computation this di tribution may be taken as constant along ea.ch panel 1 or each spar
length of the wing plane, and is 0 taken in the pre ent treu,tment.
The manner of referring the running air load and running weight of the plane to the par,
and there re olving them in the plane of the lift tru iug and drag i.russing, is <hown in fig11l'e ] n.
Let L,2 D, TV be the running lift, drag, and weio'ht of the plane and aI, bl the distances, respectively, of their points of application from the rear spar, a anel b being numerical fraction and I the
distance between spars. Then at the front par the parallel components of L, Dare aL, aD,'

gives the re ultaut spa.r runniug load R. This resultant is now resol,e<1 graphically into the
components U'u W 2 in tbe lift and drag truss planes; also into w, Wi in the pal' 'web plane t),nd
normal thereto.
In a similar manner the resultant running load and their component running load in the
lift aud drag tru R planes may be found for the remaining spar . Frequently in practice the
running 10a<1 on the lower spar of a biplane is found from that o[ the upper by dividing by some
simple ratio, say 1.2 , as indicated by aerodynamic experiments.
Example 3.-A biplane wing ha' the form und loadings shown in figure 41 ; find tbe rcsultant
loadings on the spars emd thrir ('omponents in the plnnes of tl1P lift and drag trussing for angles
of incidence of 2° and 12°.
16. SPAR BENDING MOMENTS, SHEARS, PIN REACTIONS, DEFLECTIO S.

From the rUIllling load Wi on a pnr, figure 10, }Llld from the position of the strut pins, ot'
constraint , the bending moment . shearing force , pin reaction , and eleflection may be computed by the familiar formulas for loaded beams. 1n guneral, these four quantitaties cnn be
comput.ed by tlire~t use of Clapeyron's original three-moment theorem, figure 11, but for usual
cases are more conveniently found by the formulas derived thelefrom and. presented in figures
13, 14, 15, 16.

(a) B ending moments and bending stresscs.-The bcndinO' moment diagram is usually a chain
of parabolic curves, who e mn.xima are t<Lbllln.ted, for u ual ca·sc , in figur s 13, 14 , 15, 16. From
these maxima and tbe tabulated joint moments the complete diflPram is plotted, as in .figure 17.
In some unusual cases the axe of the spar, strllt, and stay do not pass through a common
point. The increment of m oment cau ed by such eccentricity of the tay attachment is treated
analyt.ically in figure 12 and ttpplieJ graphica ll y in figure 1 .
The maximum bending moment in the trut plane, multiplied by w/u'l! gi-ve that for the
plane of the pal' web, figure 10, from which may be computed the unit bending stresses in
tho par. The uni.t stress is given by the equation
S=M/Z

J

(21)

M being the moment and Z the section modulus of the cross ection of the spar .
(b) Shea1"ing forces and shearing stresses.-The shear diagram is drawn by plotting as
ordinates the values of the transyerse shearing force on eacb side of the pins, then joining the
ordinates by traight lines, as hown in figure 17. Each line, a is well known, cuts the spar
axis at a point of zero shear and of maximum moment.
The values of the e shearing forces multipli.ed by W/Wi give the shearing forces in the
plane of the spar web, from which may be deri,ed the corresponding shearing stres es by the
shear formulas of Part 1.
(c) Pin reactions.-From the two "vertical" shears at any spar joint the pin reaction
is most readily found by simple subtraction as in figures 14, 15, 16. If the points of zero
shear-that is, of maximum moment-are Imown, the pin reaction at any joint is taken as the
distance between the neighboring maxima times the mean loading.
(d) D~flection. -To find the exact place and amount of the maximum spar panel bending
the deflection cur,e may be rlotted from the elastic equation gi,en in figures 14, 15, 16.
The panel of a spar or wing plane is its porLion bCL\\'cCn consccutive lift sLruts .

Otherwise, since the point of maximum deflection in any span is near that of maximum bending moment, the latter point may be taken as the place of maximum deflection. Then the
approximate maximum deflection d is, by the formula of figure 14, 15, 10,

d(=y)

=

-xo[12.M(l-xo) +4 V(l2+xo2) +w(l3-xoS)]/24 El ,

(_2)

where Xo is the tabulated abscissa of the point of maximum moment. As hown for an extreme
practical case in figure 19, the difference between this approximate defl ction and the true
deflection is less than 2 per cent.
Example 4.-Find the hears, moments, and reactions for the upper and lower front pars
of the biplane trussing shown in figure 40 due to the uniform running loads found in example
3; also the reactions of the spars in the planes of the lift and drag trus ing and the shears and
moments on each spar in the plane of the spar web.
ExamlJle 5.-Find and plot the resultant moments due to the uniform loading and the

17. CONCENTRATED LIFT AND DRAG 0

WING TRUSSING.

The total lift component on any strut pin in the plane of the lift struts is equal and opposite
to the pin reactions given by the formula of figures 14, 15, 10 for a running load in the r lane
of the lift trussing. Multiplying this lift component by wz/U\, figure 10, and addino- half the air
resistance of the adjoining strut and stay wire, gi\-e the drag component on the strut pin in
the plane of the drag struts. The pin lifts and drags 0 found are taken as the applied loads
on the lift trussing and drag trussing and are used to find the end vise st e.sses in th ir truts,
stays, and spar. Con,enient formulas for the concent.rated drag loads are given in .figure 20.
An alternative method for finding the force on the strut pin is to multil ly the mean
running load on the spar by the distance between the points of zero shear in the adjoining spar
panels. Equivalent formulas for this operation are given in figure 2l.
In applying this alternative method, if the points of zero shear hav not previou ly been
found they may be taken as at the centers of each panel except the inner or root panel. For
the root or inner panel the point of zero shear is three-eighths the panell,mgth from the body
hinge of the "engine section." This is an approximate method sometimes used for brevity. Its
accuracy may be judged by reference to the typical moment diagram of fi.o-ure 19.
To the above concentrated lifts must be geometrically added the weights of the struts and
stays and in some cases the weight of the motor, the force of the ailer n, the thru t of the
propeller, etc.
When external stays are applied to the wing, such a lead wires or del' truts, these may
either be assumed severed or be taken as an integral part of the tru ing. They are commonly
assumed to be severed, so that the wing may be shown adequately strong without them and
not liable to disaster in case of their accidental rupture. Then in turn the external stays are
assumed to bear the whole lift or drag while the internal ones are severeel.
If any sloping external stay, figure 24, of length r, \\'ho e three projections on the reference
planes of the machine are x, y, z, su tain a tension R, who e components are 11:", Y, Z, then
(23)
R/r=X/x= Y/y=Z/z.
Thus if any internal drag wire should fail, causing a forward pull X in the lead wire, the
stress in this latter would be R =r X/x, entailing a compression in the spar Y = yX/x.
I n case of cabane stays, figure 24, the y may be zero and R =1'X/X. Similarly,· the stress
in a fore-and-aft diagonal wing stay, supporting a drag X on the top plane, is R = r X/x.
Example 7.-Find the concentrated loads on the lift tru sing of example 4, given the
weight of the front struts, stays, cabanes, etc.
Example 8.-Given the resistance of the front struts and tays and the running load, find

MEMBERS OF NONMULTIPLANE WING TRUS ING.

(a) Due to lift and drag. - From the given concentrated load an 1 frame diagram of the
wing, the aggregate endwise tres e , and thence the unit str esse , are found by well known
flnalytic and graphic m ethods.
Convenient analytical methods of finding the aggregate tres es, i. e., in trut, stays, and
spars, are pre ented in figures 22 and 23. The u ual graphic m ethod is illustrated in figures
26 and 27.
If the stre3S in but a ingl e stru t or stay of a biplane b e de ired, it can be obtained directly
hy an appropriate formula a3 a simple summation, or a product following a summation. In
such tru s analy is the following g neralizations may be u eful:
1. Any tmt exert a thrus t equal to the sum of all the loads preceding it. Thus in figure
22 R is prececlecl by the loads G, G' , H , H' , 1, and therefore exerts at I a thru, t equal to their
SUln .

2. Any s tay exert. a tension equal to the sum of the load preceding it time~ its own
lenO'th divided by the trus gap .l Thu for the tay Q the ten. ion is (ll + H' + 1+ l' ) gjh.
Otherwise the vertical component of any, tay tension equals the difference between the struL
thrus t and the concentrated load on the strut joint; al. 0 the horizontal tension component
equals the difference of the spar thru t on either ide of the joint.
3. Any top spar pallel exerts a thrust equal to the Sllll of the moment of the preceding
loads about its inner end divided by the gap. Any lo~"er , par panel exerts a tension equal
to the urn of the moments of the preceding load about its outer end divided by the gap.
The tens ion in a lower spar panel equal the compression in the one obliquely above and out
from it.
(b) Endwise stresses in str'ut , stays, and spm" ci1u to wing torsion.- The aileron lift P A
exerts a torsional moment M = P AZ about the wing axi di tant Z from P A. The en uing
endwise stre es in the wing struts, tays, and 'pars can b e calculated by the formulas for a
twis ted pyramidal truss given in figure 33 an 1 3-1.

AIRPLANE BODY STRESSES.
By A. F.

ZABM.

21. SCOPE OF TREATME T.

The tudy of airplane body stres e may cover in uccession: The tail unit ; the tail skid ;
the chassis or landing carriage; tho fu elage; each case compromi ing the applied load, the
induced reactions, the trength of the structural elements, and fmally the factor of a rety; the
fu elaae being treated ~ast becau e tre ed by all the other members thereto attached.
22. THE TAIL UNIT.

The tail unit comprises (a) the vertical tr.il surfaces; (b) the horizontal tail surface. The
combined air forces on the tail urface - that i , the lateral force on the vertical surfaces and the
vertical force on the horizontal urfaces- are taken a applied load on the fuselag(1 stern when
.
in flight.
(a) The vertical tail surface .- The rudder may be hinged to the rear edge of a fixed vertical
fin attached to the tern of the fuselage or other r earward projecting framework. The loads on
the rudder are the air force and the tiller ~ull. I n un balanced rudder the normal tiller pull is
usually taken a the greatest force a pilot would care to exert in regular flying, and is determined
by mea uring with a spring balance the force exerted by a pilot when seated in the stationary
machine an 1 plying the control vigorou ly. In common practice the force is a sumed, as for the
aileron in section 14, to be at th0 center of the urfa e and equal to PA, where P is the pressure
per unit area of the rudder surface A.
The fixed vertical fin su tain both its own air force and the hinge forces exerted by the
vertical rudder. The first m.ay be taken a P A applied at the center of the fin area ; the second
may be computed by u e of figure 13.
(b ) The horizontal tail su1jaces.- The horizontal rudder, or levator, is u ually hinged to the
rear edge of a fixed tail plane, or tabilizer. The elevator stres. e are found a for the cases
already con iderecl of the aileron and the vertical rudder. The tabilizer i treated very like
a monoplane wing except that it su tains considerable force on its rear edge, due to the hinge
pressures, and i aeI'OclyJ1ami ally influenced by the presence of the horizontal rudder, and commonly al 0 by the propeller slip stream.
Example 1.- An elevator bearing a uniform pressure of 20 pounds per quare foot has the
dimensions and tructural form hown in figure 37. Find the moment about the hinge and the
stresses in the tay and the control wires; also the hinge reactions.
Example 2.-Find the vertical component of the pin reactions of the front and rear beam
of the stabilizer or horizontal fin , figure 37, due to a uniformly distributed pres ure of 20 pounds
per square foot and the hinge reactions of example l.
Example S.- A rudder and vertical stabilizer bearing a uniform pressure of 20 pounds per
quare foot has the dimen ion and 's tructural form shown in figure 37 ; fmd the tr ansv T load
se
on the upper and lower trus ing of the fu elage and the tran mitted couple about the normal
axis of the various section.
The tail s7cid. - When the craft is landing or resting on the earth the tail skid force is taken
as a stern load on the /Juselage.
.
The normal static or dead load on the tail skid is its ground pressure when re ting on a level
surface, or, in the ca e of certain waterplanes, it is the static lift on the rear float. The normal
lift oJ the tail skid is L = lra/l, figure 29 , iJ IT' be the to tal weight of the craft, and a, l, the distances respectively of 11' and L from the tread, or forward upp ort of the machine.

AXNUAL REPonT XATIOXAL ADvISORY ('O;\n.nTTEI~ FOn AEROi' A TIC'S.

The live Zoad on the tail kid may be resolYrcl into rectflngular component which arc found
as in figure 31, when the craWs elimen. ion. and accelerations, there d sumed, are knowll.
Otherwise the maximum tail , kid force to be proyiderl again t may be pecified by the pureha ('1'.
From the force 0 found or pecified the tresses in the tail kid , tail float or uper truclure may
he approximately calcula.tec1 by elementary static, .ignoring the accoleration within the
structure.
Example 4. - Compute th normal lift on Lhe Lail skid from the data gi\en in figure 29.
Example 5.- Given 1 = 60,544 pound-feeF, 1,, = 16 frct/sec. 2 ,1y = feet/ 'ec. 2 , a = O.l rad.
/ ec. 2 , in figure 31 and the dimen ions of a machine, find the re ultant li\e 10ad on the tail skid.
23. UNDERCARRIAGE LOADS AND STRE SES.

The normal tatic or dead load at the bottom of the undercarriage equal in magnitude the
total weight there supported when the craft is resting leycl. The uppol'ting pre sures are prl'fecLly dofinite in ome cases, as when the craft rc t. on two wherl and
kid or on four cushiOlled wheel, etc.
The stresses in the under carriage may be computed fir. I, for the normal . tatic load, then
for a similar magnified load by multiplying by an a<; umed ratio, such a f/g in section 4.
When the airplane pitehe , . kids, or -lews about, other consideration, which may be of
great importance, enter the stre s analysi. . TIl(' ('a. e of all airplane kidc1in<Y or abruptly
canting is treated at the end of thi ' article.
For a common airplane, figure 2fJ, if 7, a he, re pectively, the di tances aft the axle of the
tail- kid toe and the \\-eight II' of the whole craft Ie s wheels, theu the upward pres ure on
the skid toe is n-a/l, an~l thi taken from the \\-eight giyes t\\-iee the pressure H on each of the axles.
Re ohing R parallel to the sicle-yiew projection of tht} truts, figure 29, giyc , re. pectively, the force P u tained jointly by the front trut imd stay and Q home hy the rear ones.
The e force in turn re olyed as ho\",n giYe the tre ses in the individual uprights of the undercarriage. The first re olution obyiously gives

P = R sin a/sin 'Y
Q = R sin fl/sin 'Y,
where a, fl, 'Y arc, respectively, the ano-Ie opposite P, Q, R in the force triangle.
tions in turn give the components of P, Q in the uprights.

The stre ses in the undertru sing of a typical seaplane at re t are treated in figure 30.
The lift R resolved parallel to the front view projections of the stru ts and tay, as hown,
give it components P, Q in the planes, re pectiYely, of the stays a d of the strut . • TOW
resolving P in the true plane of the stay, Q in that of the strut, a sh wn, giYes the stresses in
the uprights.
As shown in figure 29, the strut pair bear down eac~ with the force R on the axle, bPre
It umed to be a straight and single tube.
This axle normally find upport at the centers of
the \\'heel and su tains on it segment out\mrd from the b'uts bending ana shearing tre. se
computable by the imple t cantilever formulas a u ed for wing ribs. Between the. trut
bearing the axle u tains a con tant bending moment equal to the maximum in the cantikver
portion. On thi latter portion the maximum \ ertical shearing stre 's equals the \\-hcel lift
R,' the maximum moment is RZ if l be the di tance from the lift R to the down pre uro of the
trut pair. From the shear and moment tbe factors of safety are foulld as u ual.
The live load on the bottom of the unclercarriage i treated in quite the same manner as
that on the tail kid hy the equations of figure 31.
When an airplane kids on the ground or re L' with one wheel low, the grolmd rea tion
on one wheel can be resolyed into two rectangular components, one parallel the other perpendicular to the axi . The parallel component F, ay, exerts on the axle a bending moment,
U = FR, where R is the radius of the wheel. II W he the weight, a the angle of cant, F= 1/2
\I' sin a. The en uing moment, Jl = 1/2 Wi? sin a, may he quite formidabl .
Example 6.- From the data of figure 29 compute the normal load at the wheel of the
undercarriage; also the tre ses in the undercarriao-e struts and stays and their factors of safety.

24. FUSELAGE LOADS AND STRESSES.

The fuselage may sustain gravitational, aerodynamic, and impact or acceleration loads.
The en uing stresses at each point of the tructure are eparatcly computed, then coml)ined to determine the re. ulta.nt tl'e there. .\. twofold analysi is usually made, (a) for flying conditions,
(b) for landing or tatic conditions. In both eases the analy is may he made either for the
fu elage as a unit or eparately for thc rear egment, the front segment, and the center segment.
(a) Fuselage loads and stresses fOI' flying conditions. If the loads exert no torque on the
fu clage, then for a typiC'it.l reCLI' . e,qment, figure 32 prcsents the a.nalytical treatment, figure
·~2 the graphical.
In practical compub,tion the weight, of the strut, stay, and longel'on panels
are regarded a all concentrated on the upper pins, rather than as part on ~he upper, part on the
lower pin. The ,til' force on the side of the segment is comparatively negligihle; that on the
stern, due to the tail unit, is given in paragraph 2 of this part.
The grayitational stl'e ses in the' front Sf,qment are found similarly to tho e treated in (a);
the po"-er stres es, due to pro} eller thru t ,,!lcl torque, ello-ine vibration, etc., may be estimated eparatcl.v, then combined \\'ith the former. The aerodynamic forces on the bow arc
usually negligihle.
The tres es in Lhe centa 8f,qment 01 the fuselage, due to the gnLYitational and aerodynamic
loadings, may be found separately, then comhined with those due to the action of the attached
memhers; i. e., wings, undercarriage, and front ane! rear fu elage egment.
When the applied loads e:l'ert ([ tOl'que on the fll. clage, endwise strcsses ensuing from the
latter are computed hy the formulas of figures 33 and 34 for twisted trusses. For example,
if Lhe rudder force P.l is eli tc,nt l from any axi of the fuselage, it may be replaced by a force
P A and a couple PAL, both applied at said i,xi , the force genel'H.ting one set of stress~s, the
couple another, and each set sepamtel.v computahle h.Y one or the other of the above formulas .
(b) Fu ela,qe loads (( nd stl'e8Se fol' landin,q 01' tatic conditions .- For static conditions the
loads inside the fuselage aj·c the same as those for night. The external apl)lied loads are the
wing weights, thc reactions of the tail s],id i,Ue! undercarriage. The tre ses are found as
sho\nl in Jig-Lll'e' :32 and 42.
For kinetic conditions the applil'clloads on each part are computed as explained in figme
31. The Lresse ' are then found as explt,ined in the preceding paragraph.
Example 9.-Find the stl'CS 'es in the struts, stay, andlongerons of the rear egment of
the fU:5elage clue to a unifo rm }1'cssure of 20 pounds per square foot upon the horizontal tailpieres; also tho e clue to gra\ itational loads alone.
Exam}de 10. Find the strcsses in the struts, stays, and longerons of the vertical tru sing
of the front 'egment of the fu 'clage shown in figure 35, due to grayitationalloads.
Xxample 11 .- From the daLa in the rl'ohlcm above find the stresses and factors of safety
for the principal mcmbcl" of the fusclage for a tea.dy, circular flight around a level curve of
300 feet radius at 80 miles per hour.
Example 12.- Find the tl'e es in the real' segment of the fuselage due to the tor ional

ZERO SHEAR METHOD.

The concentrated load may also be found by a metho d similar to that used for the drng
trussing in figure 21 and example ; i. e., hriefly, by multiplying the running loads hy the
distance beLween zero shears and subtracting the weights of truts and tays.
Example B.- Givcn the resi sta nce of the front struLs and sLays and the running load,
find the concentrateclloa(/s on the drag trussing of example 4 hy Lhe zero shear method.
(a) ConcenLrateclloads on upper fronL spar:
Given A = B = 0= D = 0.100 lb. per in.
xl=26.93; x2 =37.37; x3=4 .87
a=30; b=50; c= 4; d=79.
Then hy formulas of figure 21,
0=0.13+0.100(30)+0.100(26.93)=.5.2 1
JI = 0.36 + 0.100(50 - 26.93) + 0.100(37.37 ) 6.40
I =0.53+ 0.100 ( 4-37).+0.100(4 . 7)=10 .07.
(b) Concentrateclloacls on rear upper spar:

Given A=B= 0=0 .059 lb. per in.
a, b, c, xlJ x2 , X3 as above.
0' = 0.13 + 0.059 (30) + 0.059 (26 .93) = 3.4
JII = 0.36 + 0.059(50 - 26.93) + 0.059 (3 7.37 ) = 3.92
1' = 0.53+0.059( 4-37.37)+ 0.059(4 . 7)=6 .1 6.

Example 7.-Find the stresse in the undercarriage tru sing of the seaplane in figure 30,
due to a lift of 600 pound , applied at a point one-third the di iance from the front to the rear
trut attachments.
The resultant force is resolved along tlu'ee axes, pas ing through its point of application;
the X axis, which in the pre cnt ca e may be conveniently taken parallel to the line of the
fore-and-aft lower pin connections of the tru ing to the pontoon; the Yand Z axes normal
theroto. The siressos in the trus ings are then determined <:l parately for each component
and then algebraically added.
1. STRESSES DUE TO THE Z COMPONENT.

The Z component in the present problem acts in a vertical plane through the fore-ancI-aIt
pin connections of the trus ing.! Th.i vertical load i 'resolved, a hown in figure 30, into components in the planes of the [ore-and-aft ide struts and fore-and-aft s tays, hoth component
being in the YZ plane. From each of these components the stresses in the stay and Lruts
may be found as hown. The component in the plane of the tays causes a drag in the strut
plane, 'which must be determined before solving for the stl'ut plane ire ses. These drag forces
(see forces (169) and (:...4) in diagram for true plane of trut, figure 30) are cau cd by the
tension in the stays. FigUl'e 30 (A ) show the l'e olution of lift on vertical plane (rZ ); B ,

The stresse in the struts and stays due to X, Y components 'of the applied load on the
pontoon are in general olved by a method similar to l.

In the case of loads 0, 17, 1, J, K, L, Ai, etc., on a long truss it is convenient to find their
moments about different sections before substituting in the equation.
The use of the table below can be readily seen when substituting in the equations of
figure 32.

E'Cample 11.-From the data in the problems above find the stresses nd factors of safety
for the principal members of the fuselage for a steady circular flight around a level curve of 200
feet radius at 0 miles per hour.
The stresses in the front and rear sections of the fuselage may be found from the gravIty
stre ses for steady level flight in figure 36 by multiplying by a simple ratio. For a velocity of
omiles per hour and 200 feet radius, formula -, the resultant loading is 2.] 33 times the gra;,ity
loading.
The table below refers to figure 35, and gives the resultant stresses and factors of safety.
