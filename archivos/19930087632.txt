DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFLOW THEORY OF THE PROPELLER.·
By
A. Beh.

Resume t r anslated from the Garman by
Paris Oifice , N.A.C .A.

The foll owing resms of Mr. ·Be tz t paper on t he "Development of
the Inflow Theory of t he Pr opeller" was made by the t eohnical staff
of the Paris Office of the Nati onal Advis ory ~it tee for Aeronautics.
The problem i s discuss ed in a very interesting way, and it was felt
that considerable inter est would be evidenced i n the value of the conclusions ar r iv ed a t by M Betz.

We know that the theor y of inflow of the prope ller assum

veloc ity of the air, it· can easil y be shown that maximum

the prope ller.
But i t i s not so i f we introd uce the suctio nal t angen tial

The autho r, assum ing that the stream does not contr aot and
~eg­
lectin g the eff ect of rotat ion after the passa ge i n t he
plane of rotation of the pr opell er, shows that the axial veloc i ty in
the plane of
rotat ion of the prope ller, is equal to v l /2 and that t he
spee~ of rotatio~ in thi s same plane is
w'/2.
The loss of energ y, El' due to the f act tha t ~he axial veloc

The author seeks to determine the f-unction y = f(x) such that
for given values of 5, F, v, and n, the total loss of energy shall be
minimum. The calculation of the variations gives the following .-1\ela- .
tiona between y and x, satisfying these conditions :
(13)

where e is a constant corresponding in each parti cular case to a set
of values of 5, F, v, and n, and is determined b,y introducing into
equation (13) the value of y = f( B ,x) doduced from equation (13).
Fig. I, Pl. B.19, gives the curves y = f(x), that is, the distribution of the additional axial velocity along the radius for various
values of

and of A = v/Rw. Thus, assuming x .= 1/ A. , w may plot on Fig. 1 ~
e
a sheaf of i so- fO curves which will enable us t o e s timate the 16 0 - e
that is, the curve vt/v = f(r ~/v), correspondiog to given va l ues of
p and)... .
For t hi s purpose (see Fig.3,P+ . B.19) we seek on Fig. 1 the intarsection of t he ordinate x == 1/ A wi th the given iso- 1': the i 60- e
passing t hrough this point of intersection is the de sired curve gi ving
the dis tribution of additional axial velocity a l ong the radius.
