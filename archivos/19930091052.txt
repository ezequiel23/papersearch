INTRODUCTION.
In the problem
of airplane engine design, the question of the
number of poppet valves, loc_tion of valves, and the valve lift p.lay
an important
part in the power charteristics
and life of the engine.
The Clarke Thomson Research in conducting
experiments
on an air
scavaging
engine, under
the direction
of the National
Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics,
attempted to locate data on valve flow
characteristics.
Very little data was obtainable,
and in connection
with the scavaging
engine problem
the experimental
data in this
paper was obtained.
The number and character of the experiments
is not such as to render them final and conclusive, but the results
afford a direct comparison
of valves singly, in pairs, and of different
sizes.
Further ana more extensive data bea_m_ upon the subject
should be experimentally
obtained and publishea.

AIR FLOW

THROUGH

VALVES.

This discussion
deals particularly
with the merits
of inlet valves
l in pairs,
as compared
with the single inlet perhaps
more commonly
used.
The exl_erimental
data presented
affords a direct compa.nson
of valves
singly and in pairs_ o3 different
sizes, tested,
m. a cylinder
designed
in accordance
with current
practice
in aviation
engmes.
Unfortunately,
necessity
limited
the _vestigation
to measurements
taken under conditions
of continuous
flow.
This investigation
was Undertaken
after a wholly
unprofitable
search for accurate
information
upon
the comparative
flow characteristics
of single and double inlet valves,
based upon actuat measurement
rather
t_nan upon some hypothesis,
itself largely
a matter
of
opinion.
By way of preliminary
analysis,
the application
of the. law. of
geometrical
similarity
presents
a strong
case _or valves
m pairs.
For example,
at a given pressure drop and the same lift, one valve
would require a diameter
of 4 inches to provide
an area of opening
equal to that of a pair of valves
each of 2 inches diameter.
The
supel_cial
area of t_he one 4-inch valve is twice the combined
area
of the two 2-inch valves,
and if opened
against
a pressure
in the
cylinder,
this is a measure
of the comparative
forces involved.
The
4-inch valve would weigh four times the combined
weight of the 2-inch
pair, and the necessary
spring tension would differ in that proportion,
for the same lift and the same engine speed.
It may be noted here
that, while
the above is correct upon the assumption
of geometric
similarity,
the effective
valve
areas d'._er from the actual,
.as thef
coefficient
of effiux varies at different
lifts; also, ma_ me welgn_ o

would indicate.
Mr. H. L. Pomeroy

which he states
is wholly
analytical,
reaches a conclusion
decidedly
at variance

Briefly
stated,
he assumes
that two valves
of 2.83 inch diameter
should be substituted
for one of 4-inch diameter
(equal cross-sectional
port area which requires
that the smaller diameter
be 0.707 of the
Iarger
diameter)
ancl that the valves
in each case are lifted
31.65
er cent of their respective
diameters,
He then
computes
the
ydraulic
mean radii for the two cases, applies the laws of friction,
and reaches the conclusion
that the two varvcs would have a frictional
resistance
39 per cent greater
than the single valve.
The contrast
is sharp.
The tentative
conclusion
geometrically
derived
is that two valves
of one-ha/f
the cross-sectional
port area
and equal opening
area, as compared
to the single valve
would
afford the same flow.
Mr. Pomeroy's
tentative
conclusion
is that
two valves
having
the same cross-sectional
port
area as the single
valve,
and the same opening
area with a lift 0.707 that of the single
valve,
would have
a _rietional
resistance
39 per cent greater,
and
therefore
less capacity.
This discrepancy
seemed
to afford ample
ground
for experimentally
determining
the relative
flow in similar
combinations
of valves.

APPARATUS.

•The apparatus
consisted principally
of a.centrifugal
blower, a model
cylinder,
and U-tubes
for measurements
of pressure.•
The blower was one of special design with a balanced
rotor 11.25
inches in diameter,
composed
of 10 forward
curved blades.
An electric motor furnished
the power, rheostat
control permitting
speeds
from 3,000 to 6,500 revolutions
per minute,
corresponding
approximately
to pressures
of 9 to 32 inches
of water.
The numlJer
of
impulses
varied
from 30,000 to 65,000 per minute,
affording
p_raetically continuous
flow.
The blower was connected
to the cylinder
with rubber hose, care being taken to see that the alignment
of the
hose remained
perpendicular
to the face of the cylinder
at point
of entrance
throughout
the tests.
Frictional resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity.

The diameter
of the counterbore
was 5.75 inches
and of the
cylinder
proper,
5 inches.
The valves
were seated
with
a bevel

de ees in the two .planes
forming
the cylinder
head.
_The
diffuser _s_o_wn was constructed
of thin brass soldered
together
"and
inserted
so .as to divide thewhole
area of the cylinder
at that point
into
rectangular
passages

and 2
inches tong,

.....
The jet at the opposite
end of the cylinder
was likewise carved out
of white pine as shown,
and was connected
to the cylinder
head by
a length
of 5-inch wrought-iron
pipe, smoothly
galvanized
inside,
used to obtain
sufficient
length for rectification
of the air current.
Gaskets and shellac were useaat
the joints and the assembly
drawn
together
with four long bolts extending
from end to end, outside
the
cylinder.
In addition
to the single valve with a diameter
of 2.5 inches
and
the pair of, valves
with diameters
of 1.75 inches already
mentioned,
anot_her pair with diameters
of 1.25 inches
was tested.
False seats
were used with this smaller pair, consisting
of turned hardwood
rin_s,
carefully fitted to the 1.75-inch seats and beveled to receive the smaner
valves
as shown at Plate 4, Fig. 2.
These false seats obviously
left
a circular shelf or proiection
0.25 inch wide immediately
above the
.ports.
As a matter of interest,
two readings were taken with these
shelves
projecting
above the port, but before running
off the main
test on these 1.25-inch
valves, the lines Of the passages
were smoothed
off by filling in above these projections
with putty, giving the approximate stream lines shown.
The valves
were all designed
on similar
lines with the exception
that the smallest
pair had stems five-sixteenths
inch in diameter,
to fit the guides used for the larger pair, this dimension
being 40 per
cent larger than true proportion
dictated,
equivalent
to a reduction
of 0.022 square inch or 1.8 per cent of the port area of the smaller
pair.
The Pitot tube shown in the iet in Plate 1 was clamped
in position
at the axis of the iet throughout
the tests, velocity readings
berg
taken
as later
described.
The dimensions
were
three-sixteenths
inch outside
diameter
and about 2.5 inches
in length.
The impact
end was gradually
rounded
and the static holes were four in number,
about 0.02 inch diameter,
smoothlyperforating
the outer wall.
A static tube of one-eighth
inch diameter
penetrated
the central_
portion
of the cylinder,
reading
static
pressure
of the air column
Mter passing
the valves
and the diffuser.
This is for convenience
termed[ the "lower
static."
Static tubes of one-eighth
inch diameter
also tapped the flow where
the air column entered
the passage leading
to the valves.
These are
for convenience
termed "upper
static," only one being used at a time,
as indicated
by its position
with respect
to the valves.
All statics
were slightly
roundest on the inner periphery,
and the end kept flush
with the inner surface of the cylinder
or passage, and so located as to
be perpendicular
to the direction
of air flow.
The upper and lower statics were connected
to the two legs of a
O-tube t_ read directly the pressure drop through
the valve, and also
connected
to other U-tubes
to readthe
upper static and lower static
head separately.

All U tubes had an .inside diameter

vertical
with the exception
of one, which was inclined
at a slope of
10 to 1 to read with greater
accuracy
velocity
pressures
of 3 inches
or" less.
A centigrade
thermometer
was clamped _with its bare b_b in the
air jet at a point about 1.5 inches outside
the apparatus.
A similar
:thermometer
was hung on the wall for readings of room temI_erature.

as taken from a recording

as were those of the barometer.
All readings were completed within
a period of seven and one-half hours, on bIay 23, 1918.
MEASUREMENT

OF AIR FLOW.

The method
used for measuring
the velocity
and quantity
of air is
based upon the principles
of the impact
tube and the jet. 1
Briefly, the impact
tube, when helc[in and parallel to the air stream,
registers
a pressure
corresponding
to the total energy in the air at
f_hat point.
In Case of continuous
flow through
a pit)e of varying
cross section, if the impact
tube is moved up the _txis of the air stream,
the pressure
registered
is constant
at all points,
except
for friction
losses.
The velocity
pressure
and static pressure
vary with every
change
of cross section,
but the sum of the two, which the impact
tube reads, is constant
at all points,
as the law of conservation
of
energy indicates.
This is similar
to Bernouilli's
theorem
in hydraulics.
• Where'the
section of the pipe is smaller, the velocity
of the air must
be higher,
as the quantity
passing all sections of the channel in _t given
time is constant
under
conditl"ons
of continuous
flow. Hi"gher
velocity
means greater
kinetic energy in the moving
air particle,
and
this increment
can only arise out of a corresponding
diminution
of
the static
pressure. 2
The jet here used for flow measurement
carried this case further,
contracting
the air column to about one-sixth
of its area and discharging into atmosphere
at a static pressure equal to atmospheric
pressure,
or zero U-tube
reading,
all energy in the air being ]_netic,
read as
velocity
pressure by the impact
tube.
This requires
that the theo• 1 An excellent discussion of the use of the impact tube and jet may be found in a

pressure and vice versa) takes place with 100 per cent efficiency, as there is always a
conversion loss due to generation of heat by surface and internal friction.. In the_c.ase
of convergeace or reduction of area, the conversion loss is relatively much tess, and the
an_le of convergence and "stream lining" of the conductor much less important than
in _ase of divergence or increase in area. Convergence reduces static pressure and surface friction and produces a jet effect which rectifies the lines of flow and reduces, or
at least does not increase, eddy effects and internal friction. Divergence, on the other
hand, increases static pressure and surface friction, and unless the angle of divergence
be very small, results in conversion losses so large as to indicate great internal fr_ction
or eddying, probably in the nature of a rolling motion caused by large velocity differences at different radii. When the angle of divergence reaches 30 degrees on each side
of the axis, the theoretical static gain is entirely eliminated by the conversion loss.
An excellent discussion of conversion losses with experimental data and efficiency
curves may be found in Fan Engineering, pages 120-126, by Willis H. Carrier, member
A. S. M.E.
bluck of the foregoing is quite elementary in character, but it appears
that the characteristics of air flow are perhaps less generally understood than most
branches of engineering data, and their treatment often seems more complex than
illuminating, considered with respect to the average needs• ot me engineer..

pressure of the region into which the jet discharges to the absolute
pressure of the region from which the let discharges be greater than
the critical value, 0.5272, for air.
After verifying
the fact that throughout the range of velocities
used, the impact side of the Pitot tube at any given velocity showed
constant readings for various positions in the jet, the Pitot was
clamp_ed in position, and readings from the impact side only recorded
as v_locit_y pressures.
At frequent intervais
during the runs the
static side of the Pitot was tested, but invariably showed zero readin.g.
The velocity in the jet roughly equaled the velocity through the
average valve opening, being about six times the mean velocity in the
cylinder proper.
In actual magnitude,
the velocities ranged from
1,500 to 19,000 feet per minute, or 25 to 320 feet per second, covering
about the extreme range of mean inlet velocities
encountered
in
practice.

In the case of the larger pair, it should be noted
that the diameter of 1.75 inches, used for convenience,
gives an area
about 2 per cent less than that required by the geometrical
relation
for equal area, namely, D_r0-_ -- 0.7071 D = 1.768 inches diameter, for
the pair to equal the area of the single valve.
T_e lifts used with •each combination
of valves were as follows:
0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and 1.50 inches.
These
Valve lifts were carefully laid off and marked on the stems, and the
settings made against fixed indicator
points attached to the head
of the cylinder.
No screw thread or micrometer
arrangement was
used, and the probable
error was relatively
much greater at lower
lifts.
However, independent
settings at low liftschecked
within the
limit of error of about 2 per cent contemplated
_or the investigation
as a whole.
Adjustable
clamps were usedto hold the valves in position when set, and readings
taken

After increasing the lift up to 1.5 inches with each valve combination, the valves were reversed; that is, the stems were clamped in the
guides so as to project slightly through the ports, the valve heads
remaining entireIy outside the cylinder, and readings taken to determine the flow through the ports, eliminating the effect of the valve
heads as baffle plates in the cylinder.

design that lifting a valve about one-quarter

1917, makes the following
statement
concerning valve lift:
Coming now to the question of valves, everyone knowsthat _iis. of noconseque_e
to lift a poppet valve more than one-quarter oI l_s ammeter.
It is atso true ma_ t e
valve will work better, and the volumetric efficiency and mean effective pressure
be better, the larger the diameter of the valve and the smaller the let; that is, the
valve should not approach the quarter diameter lift. That condition conforms to
good principles of gaseous flow.
EXPERIMENTAL

DATA.

Tables
2, 3, and 4 contain
the data rQcorded in the tests of the
three
valve
combinations.
_They_ are similar
in form
and refer,
respectively,
to the 1.75-inch
valves,
the 2.5-inch

and the
1.25-inch
valves.
The pressure

are printed
as read,

The readings
Of velocity
pressure in the first column were partly
taken on a U-tube inclined
at a slope of 10 to 1, to facilitate
more
accurate
readings
of small
quantities,

point
is

so as to show pressures
in inches of water, vertical

Readings
taken on the inclined
tube are given to.thr, ee.places

After reaching
the limit of this reclined tube at
about 30 inches, or 3 inches actual head, the remaining
readings
were
taken on the usual vertical
tubes.
This column represents
velocity
pressure in the jet.
The second
column
shows the square root of the corresponding
reading of velocity
pressure
in the first column, computed
by sane

These
amounts
represent
the relative
velocities
in the jet.
The third column or lower static reading refers to the static pressure
in the cylinder.
_here
these readings are small the probable error
on account
of capillarity
or inequality
in the tubes is rather large,
but they were merely used for a rough chec]_ on the pressure
drop
through the valve tested,
shown in the fourth
column,
which was
read from _ tube connected
to both upper and lower statics.
The square root of pressure drop through
the valve, computed
by
slide rule, appears in the fifth column
and is proportional
to
the
theoretical
mean velocity
through the valve.
A separate

the upper static appears in the sixth column,

show in degrees Centrigr_de
the considerable
variations of temperature
with the velocity.
The ninth column gives the

on valve areas equal to II Dh and assuming
that the density
of the
air was atmospheric.

results
so obtained
may,
therefore,
be directly
compared,
owing to
the use of this jet as the common medium of measurement
in all tests.
As to these plates 2, 3, and 4, it is true that the scale issmall,
and
that plotting
to square roots tends to reduce the magnitude
of any
irregularities
in the points obtained,
but the close coincidence
of the
points with the straight
graphs passing through
the origin seems to
warrant
the conclusion
that the actual velocity
through
the valve at
any given
lift varies directl_
with the square root of the pressure
drop, at least within the limits of these tests, as does the theoretical
velocity.
It further
follows
as a general
rule within
these limits
that the coefficient
of efflux does not vary with the press_ure drop.
Certain
limitations
upon this 'conclusion
may be reqmred,
however,
and will be discusse(t
in connection
with the graphs
showing
the
variation
of the coefficient
of efltux with the lift.
Curves
of equal
velocities
have
been
superimposed
upon
the
gr_aphs of plates
2, 3, and 4 to show the approximate
velocities
through
the valves in feet per second.
At about the average
conditions
of the tests, namely,
80 ° F., 55 per cent humidity,
68 ° wet
bulb,
and
29.72 inches
barometer,
air weighs
0.0717
pounds
per
cubic foot.
Inserting
this value
in the' equation
V= 18.275_/p/w
gulives 17=68.2_fp.
In other
words,
assuming
air at this density,
tiplying
the vertical
scale by 68.2 gives actual
velocity
through
the jet in _eet per second,
and applying
the same correction
to_e
horizontal
scale gives theoretical
velocity
through
the valves.
T e
actual velocity
through
the valves may then be obtained
either by
applying
the ratio of areas to the vertical
scale of jet velocities
or
by applying
the proper cQefficient
of eCflux to the ]aorizontal
scale
of theoretical
valve velocities.
Curves
representing
actual velocities
of 100, 200, and 300 feet per
second through
the valves
have been laid off by the former method
and a_ree fairly with results obtained
by the latter method,
except
as to Irregularities
in some of the points used for plotting
the coefficient curves later presented.
These
curves
may be used to approximate
the actual
pressure
drop necessary
to l_roduce a given velocity.
For example,
in plate 2
it isseen
thatthe-pair
of 1.75-inch
valves with 0.20 lift indicates
a
Velocity of 200 feet per second at the ordinate
corresponding
to 3.55
in the horizontal
scale or 12.6 inches
of water or 0..455 pounds
per
square inch as the required
pressure
drop.
It should be noted that
these velocity
curves are merely approximate
and that
errors up to
5 per cent or so may be found.
In plate 4, figure 2, will be found an illustration
of the manner
in
which
a pair
of 1.25-inch
valves
were seated
in the cylinder
for
testing.
The closely shaded sections represent
the false seat of hard-

wood,
and the dotted
sections
indicate
the putty
used to join the
ports of the false seats smoothly
to the passages.
Before making
the putty joint as shown,
two tests of purely
collateral interest
were made at 0.3 inch lift, to show the effect of the
sharp ledge in the passage.
The results
are shown
by the dotted
line x-y,
the flow being 13 per cent less for any given pressure drop,
than with the passage
stream-lined
as described.
It is, therefore,
evident
that any projections
or sharp angles in the passage
tend do
greatly
reduce the flow, as might well be anticipated.
The very common custom
of finishing
the inlet passages
with two
bores meeting
at an angle of about
110 degrees
eermimy
purs, a
heavy
restriction
upon valve efficiency,
but doubtless
constructional
convenience
may be held to justify thepractice.
Interesting
experimental
work
could be done on the design
of
valve guides,
possibly
joining them to the wall of the passage
with
a Web of stream-line
section.
Valves
with
an extremely
heavy
fillet have been used in the R. A. F. 3a engine,
doubtless
with the
idea of guiding
the air current smoothly
to tim valve opening.
Yenturi effects in the passage .immediately
above
the va_lve might
be
productive
of excellent
results.
The use of the putty as_above
described
to reduce the size of the
passage
to the diameter
of the small valve, introduced
a converging
nozzle effect which doubtless
tended to direct the air stream inward
toward
the valve stem and thereby slightly
impair
the efficiency
of
this small pair of valves.
It is evident
that the intercepts
on any ordinate
onplate
2, 3, or 4
will represent
the variation
of the flow with the vaIve lift, at the
pressure
drop corresponding
to the ordinate
selected.
Plate 5, figure 1, presents such curves for the three valve combinations,
plotted
from. intercepts_
on the ordlnates,
corresponding_
to a
pressure drop of 16 inches of water,
the ordinates
numbered
4 in the
square root scale.
The relation
would have been the same had any
ot_her ordinate
been
chosen,
but the quantities
would
have been
different.
The curve of flow for the single 2.5-inch valve lies between
those of
the pairs of valves
at all lifts.
_It is found to be very nearly equal to
that of the smaller
pair for low lifts and approximates
that of the
lar_er pair at the higher lifts.
]?hese curves are plotted
against
valve lift in inches,
but for convenience
the points equal to one quarter
and one-half
diameter
have
been marked
on each curve.
By interpolation
between
these point,s
and others similarly
located,
the approximate
curve of flow for two
valves of 1.5 inch diameter
is presented.
This indicates
a flow cjuite
closely
equal to that of the single 2.5-inch
valve, up to a lift of about
• 0.6 inch.

AIR FLOW THROUGH

POPPET VALVES.

,

.

2i

Thepoints
connected
to the curves by broken lines indicate,
to
vertical
scale only, the flow with the valves
reversed.
This might
be considered
equivalent
to the flow with the valves
at an infinite
lift, whiQh agrees with the horizontal
trend of the curves, but more
practically,
these points represent
the maximum
limit of flow through
the respective
ports at this pressure
drop.
These curves, comparing
performance
upon a basis of equal lift in inches,
are particularly
applicable
where it is conceded
that •mechanical
features
generally
limit the possible lift regardless
of valve diameter..
On the other hand, it is often asserted
that the proper limit of
valve lift is a function
of t.he diameter,
and for purposes
of comparison
on this basis, figure 2 of plate 5 has been prepared from the curves last
discussed,
changing
the horizontal
scale to read in per cent of the
diameter
of each valve.
In the case of pairs of valves,
the flow of
both is plotted
against the lift, expressed
in per cent of the diameter
of one valve only.
The result of this transposition
is at once apparent.
The intercepts
on any ordinate
very
closely
agree with the proportionate
cross-sectional
port areas of the several
valve combinations,
and in
the case of the two curves
corresponding
to valve
combinations
with equal cross-sectional
port area, the curves coincide
within
the
probabIe
error of the work.
Up to a lift of 0.5 diameter
the coincidence is all the more exact if l_t be remembered
that the two 1.75inch valves
have an area about
2 per cent less than the single 2.5inch valve.
From this it would
appear reasonable
to infer that under fairly
similar
conditions
different
valves
or combinations
of valves
have
capacities
in proportion
to their respective
cross-sectional
port areas,
when the lift in each case is same per cent of their respective
diameters.
It also seems logical to infer that the theory of the hydraulic
mean
radius
has but little application
ito the losses in poppet
valves,
it
being more properly
applicable
to what may, for convenience,
be
termed surface _rietion,
or actual rubbing of the moving
fluid upon
the surrounding
wall, whence
its derivation--the
relation
of cross
sectional
area to perimeter
in contact with the moving fluid.
In the case of continuous
flow through
a pipe or conduit,
pressure
losses may be classified as friction losses and dynamic
losses, although
no sharp distinction
can be drawn.
Dynamic
losses are due to change
in direction,
either of the whole column or its lesser parts, as atelbows,
nozzles, or offsets;
and friction
of the fluid against the walls undoubtedly causes a rolling motion with change of both direction
and velocity
in the adjacent
particles.
The change in directionat
an elbow will
cause a .greater pressure with greater friction on the outer side.
An
easy-radius
elbow is ordinarily
estimated
to cause a pressure
loss
equal to the friction loss in 10 diameters
of straight
pipe, but a rightangle or mitered
joint in the pipe will cause a loss equal to the friction
loss in nearly 50 diameters.
1 It is thus evident
that where marked
changes in direction
take place in a length of but two or three diameters, the dynamic _losses may be many times as great as the losses
due to friction,
and the case of the inlet passage
terminating
in a
poppet valve fails in this class.

As a rough compa.rison of probable
friction
loss and dyna_nic loss.
it may be assumed
that the friction in the passage
and at the lip oI
the valve is equivalent
to that of 5 diameters
of straight
pipe at the
_n.e
velocity.
From
Mr,
Busey's
experiments
dynamic
losses
might be expected
equal to the friction loss in about 8 diameters
due
to the curvature
of the passage,
and further
dynamic
losses equal to
the friction in at least 30 diameters
due to the sharv chan_e of direction at the valve seat, - 60 degrees
at low lifts with a 30-degree
seat.
If this comparison
is within
the limits of fair approximation,
Mr.
Pomerov's
39 per cent _reater
friction loss is only applicable
.to about
15 per c'eut of the totaI loss, or about 6 per cent less capacity
would
be expected
from a pair of valves having 0.7 the diameter
and 0.7
the lift of a single valve.
From the data here obtained,
it appears
that the two valves have only about 2 per cent less capacity
at 0.7
the lift.
For ready comparison,
Table 6 has been prepared from the vertical
intercepts
on the curves of figure 2, plate 5, sho wh__g the relative
crosssectional
port areas and capacities
in per cent of the area and capacity
of thesingle
2.5-inch
valve,
each valve
being lifted
the same per

It is evident
from an inspection
of the curves on plate 5 that a lift
equal to one-quarter
diameter
develops
less than 67 per cent of the
full capacity
of theport,
and that a lift of one-half
diameter
develops
80 to 90 per cent of-the full capacity.
The coefficient
of effiux is taken as the ratio of the observed
mean
velocity
throug h the valve to the mean velocity
which would
theoreticall3r result
from an equat pressure
.drop.
Assuming
that the
temperature,
density,
and humicIity
of the air are the same at the
valve as at the jet, this coe_cient
may be obtained
directly
from the
relation
of the areas and the proportional
velocities
set forth in
Tables
2, 3, and 4.
The proportional
velocity
at the jet multiplied
by the ratio of the jet area to.valve
area gives the proportional
velocity through
the valve.
If the ratio of this velocity
to the square
root of the pressure
drop be taken,
the result is the coefficient
of
effiux.
To be more exact,
this should
be multiplied
by 0.99, the
coefficient
of the jet.
The above short method
may be. justified
by developing
the usual
equation
V= 2_/-_]_ in the units here most convenient:
Vffi velocity
in feet per second.
g ffi acceleration
constant
of gravity in feet per second.
ffi head of air in feet causing the flow.

In computing the coefficient the valve area has been taken as _rD h
for all lifts.
It is realized that for small lifts the aid of trigonometrical
formulae may be invoked to determine
accurately
the least area of
opening, but the same formulae are not applicable at higher lifts.
Moreover, they are only justifiable upon the theory that the lines of
flow are parallel to the slope of the valve seat, a condition which
certainly does not obtain for any except the smallest lifts:
In plate 6 the coefficients of effiux will be found, plotted against
valve lift in inches in figure 1, and against lift in per cent of diameter
in figure 2. These coefficients are considerably
higher at low lifts,
a feature somewhat difficult to explain satisfactorily.
Both friction
and dynamic losses should, be greater at low lifts, as the ratio of
perimeter
to area is then greater and the angular deflection sharper.
It seems probable that there is an approximation
to a jet action at
low lifts, the discharge taking place into a region of relatively
low
pressure, somewhat after the manner of the true jet used for measurement at the outlet end of the cylinder.
The comparatively
high
discharge
efficiency of any such jet seems to make this the most
probable explanation
of the high coefficients.
If such jet action takes place, the pressure in the valve area should
approximate that of the cylinder itself, and the theoretical
velocity
through the valve should be computed upon the lower pressure rather
than Be higher.
This would reduce the error involved in computing
the theoretical
flow and coefficient upon the assumption
of atmospheric density in the valve, as has .been done.
The maximum
statm pressure in the cyl_-der was 17.5 inches of
water.
As a pressure of 1 inch of water is equal to a pressure of

and equal humidity

Refermng again to plate 6, it will be noted that in figure 1, where the
coefficients
are compared
at the same absolute

betweez_ the three valve
combinations
are quite considerable,
and
that at the very low lifts the'points

The points for the two larger combimations

CONSIDERATIONS.

The only experimental
investigation
of the flow of air through
poppet
valves
of which record was found in the technical
publications was carried out as a thesis by Mr. R. M. Strong
and Mr. F.
W. Hollman,
and laterpublished
by Prof. C. E, Lu_ke under
the
title,
"Pressure
Drop Through
Poppet
Valves,"
Vol.
27, Transactions
of the American
Society
of Mechanical
Engineers
(1905).
Prof. Lucke seems
to have been the first to call attention
to two
noteworthy
characteristics,
which
are found to be supported
by the
data here presented;
first, that the coe_ _ient of efliux, computed

for air at atmospheric
density,
is nearly
constant
for all pressure
drops;
and, second, that
this coefficient
is much larger
for low lift's
Tests
were made both with continuous
flow, and intermittent
flow,
the latter
bein_
as nearly
as •possible
similar
to actual
operating
conditions
for the two gas engines
tested,
and it was found _hat the
coefficient
of effiux for continuous
flow was not the same as that
for intermittent
flow, even at the point
of zero acceleration.
It is patent
that extreme
care should
be exercised
in any attempt
to apply the results
of continuous-flow
experiments
to flow under
operating
or intermittent
cond__tions,
since
inertia
and resonance
effects
in the inlet manifold
will obviously
make
great
differences
in the. absolute
quantities,
and these effects will vary with the type
of manifold
used.
l_oreover,
the pressure
drop,
velocity,
and coefficient
will obviously
vary
with many
other
factors
as between
different
engines,
different
speeds
for the same
engine,
and as to
instantaneous
values
at different
points
of the stroke
for a given
engine at a given speed.
However,
m the question
of design as to whether
two inlet valves
or one should
be used, it is believed
the comparative
results
here
presented
may be made to serve a real purpose.
It is difficult
to
perceive
any reason
why the comparative
relations
obtaining
between
these
three
valve
combinations
for continuous
flow should
not find some parallel
in the comparative
relations
between
the same
three combinations
for intermittent
flow, if no other variables
are
permitted
to affect the comparative
results in the latter case.
Only
inherent
differences
between
the three
clmbinations,
effective
with
intermittent
flow and noneffective
with
continuous
flow,
or vice
versa,
would
appear capable
of affecting
this parallel,
and it is improbable
that such differences,
if any, are of great
magnitude.
It is hoped that these modest experiments
will arouse interest
in
the question
of multiple
valves,
and certainly
the discussion
of any
direct comparisons
obtained
in practice
would
be very interesting.
Aeronautic
engines of today have so nearly approached
the theoretical
limit of efficiency
that even small improvements
may be well worth
while, but it seems probable
that the mechanical
advantages
oi auai
or multiple
valves may be of even more importance.
The dimensions
of the cylinder
model used for these experiments
offer a ready basis for discussion,
and are commonly
encountered
in
aviation
engine practice,
the bore being 5 inches
and the diameter
of combustion
chamber
5.75 inches.
A combustion
chamber
of
this size permits
the use of two valves of 2.5 inche_ diameter,
or four
valves
ot'1.875
inches
diameter,
inclined
at 15 or 20 degrees
to the
cylinder
axis in both cases.
Four 1.75-inch
valves
can. be placed
in a 5.5-inch
cylinder
head inclined,
or a 5.75-inch
cy.,lin_der head
vertical;
and four
1.5-inch
valves
are even more readily
accommodated
in a 5-inch cylinder
head, or a cylinder
having
the combustion
chamber
the same diameter
as the cylinder
proper.
These
valves
may be placed
vertically,
and the cylinder
is much more
easily
machined.
The combustion
chamber
will have better
proportions,
and the slight increase
in cylinder
height will be more than
offset as to over-all height
by the saving in spring length.
Two 1.5-inch
valves
will have
a flow capacity
equal
to _e

but 72 per cent as much area to any pressure
in the cylinder
at the
time of opening,
and will weigh but 56 'per cent of the weight
of
the single valve,
assuming
that the weights
vary as D 2"6, wlfich!s
approxtmately
correct
for these
sizes.
Assuming
any reasoname
pressure
in the cylinder
at the time of valve
opening,,
andspring
tensions
in proportion
to valve
weights,
it is evident
that the Cwo
small valves will require less than half the power to open them, and
this will be a direct saving
of mechanical
loss, _ valve .action is not
the type of reciprocating
motion
which can re_urn aurmg
one portion of the stroke
energy stored during another
portion,
excepting
only the energy stored [u the spring.
Et has been said that valves in pairs are more difficult to cool than
single valves,
but this does not appear to stand analys:is.
The proportion
of the 5-inch cylinder
head occupied
by thesmall
valves is
only about 95 per cent of the proportion
of the 5.75-inch head occuplea
by the large valve.
The circu_erence
of the two valves
is 20 per
cent greater
than that of the single valve,
and although
the seats
wouk[ have somewhat
less width,
the distance
of heat flow in this
direction
would
be but 60 per cent as great.
As to the portion
of
the heat which flows to the guide, the conditions
are also somewhat
in favor of the small valves,
the distance
to the water-cooled
_or51on
of the guide being less and the proportion
of water-coole_
guide
greater.
.
In one example
of. foreign .engine design dual valves
of aboutthis
size are lifted
to one-half
diameter,,
ana give entirely
s_lsIac_or_"
oReration
at speeds up to 2,200 revolutions
per minute.
The possibilities
in this direction
are largely
untried,
but the negative
work
used in overcoming
valve resistance
to inlet flow might
be reduced
with small valves at hig h lifts and the volumetric
efficiency increased,
without
introducing
serious mechanical
difficulties.
T_s,
of course,
is contrary
to the principle
of using low lifts to secure a higher coefficient, but still the over-all reset
might be beneficial.
The comparison
of a single 2.5-inch
valve to a pair of 1.75-inch
valves
may be analyzed
in much the same manner,
and as _o heat
conditions
the result would
seem slightly
in favor
of the pair.
If
lifted 0.375 inch, the capacit_
will be 25 per cent _reater
than that
of one 2.5-inch valve, according
to the experimental
results shown in
Table 5, or the resistance
will be but 64 per cent as great, the resistance
varying
approximately
with
the square
of velocity
or capacity.
This sliou[dr result in higher
volumetric
efficiency,;
The su_erfic!al
area of the two combinations
would
be practicauy
equal, Du_ me
weight
of the pair would be but 82 per cent of that of the single valve,
with correspondingly
reduced
total
spring tension
and slightly
reduced mechanical
loss.

The valve factor for the 4-valve Mercedes is but slightly larger
than that of the 2-valve, and the mean effective pressure is increased
only 5 per cent, which is practically
accounted for by the increase
in compression
ratio from 4.50 to 4.94.
In the Benz 4-valve, the
factor is increased 35per
cent and the mean effective pressure increased 10 per cent, only about one-half of which can be due to the
increase in compression
ratio from 4.50 to 4.91.
In plate 7 a comparison is made of the power output of these four
engines plotted against gas velocity through the inlet valve.
These
velocities are computed for this comparative purpose, as the ratio of
piston displacement
per explosion to one-half the product of valveopening area by the time of t h e ope nm__. The broken curves repre"
sent the 4-valve Benz and Mercedes, respectively,
reduced approximately to compensate
for difference in compression
ratio.
In conclusion, a summary
of the results experimentally
derived is
•presented.
It should be borne in mind that the number and character of the experiments
is not such as to render them final and conclusive.
It is earnestly hoped that further and more extensive data
bearing upon this subject _
be exper'._entally
obtained and published, and it is believed that the results here presented will be found
substantially
correct in the light of later research.
Caution should
be exercised in the application of these results, for apparent similarity
with respect to air flow is often most deceptive.

CONCLUSIONS.

1. The coefficient
of effiux is practically
constant,
for all pressure
drops (at least below
1 pound
per square inch)
where _ the lower
pressure is approximately
atmospheric,
and the theoretical
flow is computed upon air at atmospheric
density.
2. U1ider conditions
of general
similarity,
the coefficient
of effiux
is very nearly
the same for valves
of different
sizes, at equal lifts
expressed
in per cent of their respective
diameters.
3. Lifting a valve one-quarter
of its diameter
may_develop
an area
of opening geometrically
equal to its port area, but affords a capacity
less than 67 per cent o_f that of the unobstructed
port, a_ the same
pressure
drop;
a lift equal to one-half
diameter
develops
80 to 90
per cent of this maximum
capacity:
4. At the same pressure
drop, one valve of diameter
D and lift h
is e_ual in capacity
to:
First. A pair of valves
of diameter
and lift 0.707 h.
Second.
A pair of valves
of diameter
of h not exceeding
about 0.25 D.
