‘

This investigation was conducted at the Bureau of Standards for the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics.
Brass has often been assumed superior to steel for spark plug shells because of its greater
heat conductivity. The measurements described, ip this report prove the contrary, showing
that the interior of a spark plug having, a brass shell is from 50° to 150° C. (90° to 270° F.)
hotter than that of a similar steel plug. Consistent results were obtained in both an aviation
and a ~ruck engine, and under conditions which eliminated all other sources of difference
between the plugs. It is to be concluded that steel is to be preferred to brass for spark plug
shells.
INTRODU@iON.

The measurements described below were undertaken to compare the temperatures attained
in various portions of spark plugs having brass and steel shells. The plugs used were of the
Rajah type. The porcelains were especially rnaclewith a hollow central (electrode) space of
approximately 2 mm. (0.08 inch) diameter and sealeclat the lower end. The temperature gradient along this central axis of the porcelain was raeasuredwith a movable copper constantan
thermocouple. A brass tube about 2 cm. (0.8 inch)’in diameter and 15 cm. (6 inches) in length
was ?ttached to the upper part of the shell of each plug to protect the thermocouple and to
support it in any desired position.
MEASUREMENTS

WITH PLU.GS IN HALL-SCOTT MOTOR.

Two plugs with brass and two with steel shells were placed in the re=gular
spark plug holes
on the exhaust side of a four-cylinder Hall-Scott rno}or, type A-5a, running at a speed of about
1,500 revolutions per minute, and delivering about 110 horsepower to an airplane propeller.
A separate run was made for each plug and the temperatures measured after sufficient time
had elapsed (about a half “hour) for the temperature to become constant. The temperature of
the discharge water from the cylinders was about 70° C. (158° F.) in each case. The following
table contains the results of the measuremerits. The first columg gives the position of the
thermocouple from the bottom of the porcelain. This was limited by the depth of the central
space.

‘MEASUREMENTS IN A TRUCK MOTOR.

Similar measuremgmtswere made in a Waukesha truck motor with special cylinder heads
which gave a maximum compression of about 115 pounds per square inch. This motor was
connected with a dynamometer and loaded down with the throttle wicle open to run tit m“speed
of 1,000 revolutions per minute. There was no fan or radiator conneckd but the discharge
water was thermostated at a temperature of 63° C. (145° l?.). Each plug was placccl separately in the second cyhder ad inthesame spark plug ~okj which was specially drilled nnd
tapped in a position origina~lyused for a priming cup. The bottom of the plugs lacked rhout
2.5 cm. (1 inch) of bem flush with the bide cylkder wall. The temperature grnclicnts along
the central axis of the porcelains were measured as before. An additional thermocouple was
placed about 2 V.
(0.08 inch) withrn the metal of the ~h~ of each plug and level with the
copper gasket below the shoulder of the porcelain.

CONCLUSIONS.

The measurements indicate that the temperatures of the brass shells are considerably
higher than the steel in each case. Mao, the temperatures in the center of the porcelain are
higher in the case of brass shells. This dift’erence can not be attributed to difference in gas
Iealmge, since pIugs of the same materiaI differing quite widely in leakage gave practicality
identicaJ resuks. Also, the thread dimensions were so neady the same that the difference in
temperature can not be due to difference in the contact between the plug and the jncket, and
is apparently due to the difference in the materia~ of the shell. Thk effect is apparently due
to the greater thermal conductivity of brass (0.22 c. g. s. units) as compared with steel K).11
c. g. s. units). The heat received from the hot gases in the cylinder by the inner end of the
brtiss plug is more readily conducted longitudinally to the upper part of the shell, which is
thus maintained at a relatively higher “temperature in spite of the Ioss of heat from the upper
portions of the shell and insulator by radiation and convection. Since the contact between
the porcelain and the plug is above the plane of the engine water jacket, the porcelain is less
efleotively cooled in the case of the brass plug where the upper part of the metal is hotter,
and consequently shows a higher temperature throughout its length.
