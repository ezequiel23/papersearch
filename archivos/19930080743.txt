At the Aero-Technical.
Conference of the WVissenschaf3tliche

held on April 23, 1919, one of the

most important of the objections brought forward by Herr SEPPELER*”%ith

.

regard to the dynamometer hub****was that “the engine

must continue to retain its flywhee;l.n
As th2s opinion delayed the development of the dynamometer
hub at that time, and it might everinow give rise.to erroneous
views concerning its merit, we shall make a brie~ investigation
of the extent to which the dynamometer affects the well-known
flywheel action of the propeller. This point will be discussed.
later on, azndwill be applied to coupling, toothed gear> etc.

This RESiSf’ANGXl l?
O THE AIR, which is not generally taken
into account, is yet of actual importante when a mowable organ,
such as the dynamornete is inserted between the engine and the
r,
propeller, ad+he propelier then oscillates freely between a capsule tappet-xod and a collar, with a clearance of about 5°.
In place of the usual rigid joint between the engine and the pTopeller, the CLOSED CIRCUIT is here brought about by the resistance of the air.

The following article will show that THIS

We must then find out to what extent the engine may be retarded
until the propeller is lifted in consequence of its inertia to
the resistance- tliehammer of the rotary moment capsule, so
of
that it oscillates freely or strikes against the stop. The retarding zotaxy moment must then be at least eqyivalenli the

In case of change of pressure, the negative rotary moments
may (in one instance) increase up to 1/20 of’the rotary moment
of the prapeller before the propeller becomes free.

In the case

cf ordina-ry
engines, this generallyallows for the cessationof

one cyltnderwithout any lifting On the part of the propeller,
and without deprivingthe engine of its flywheel.
