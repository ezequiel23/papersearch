DESCRIPTION OF AIRPLANE EMPLOYED.

In a series of tests which have been made by the advisory committee's staff at Langley
Field during the summer of 1919 with the objects of determining the characteristics of airplanes
in flight and the extent to which the actual characteristics differ from those predicted from
tests on models in the wind tunnel, and of studying the balance of the machines and the forces
which must be applied to the controls in order to maintain longitudinal equilibrium; two airplanes have been employed. Both are advanced training machines of the JN4H type and
both are equipped with Hispano-Suiza 150 horsepower engines, but they are somewhat different in structural details. The most important differences in connection with the aerodynamic
characteristics of the airplanes are the use of an oil radiator suspended below the body and a
reserve gasoline tank mounted in the center section of the upper wing on one of the machines,
these accessories being lacking on the other. The machine carrying the oil radiator and the
reserve tank will be referred to in thi report as o. 1, the other as o. 2. In addition to the
differences just noted, airplane No.1 had the aluminum doOI in the sides of the body, just
forward of the wings, removed in order to permit of a freer flow of air through the radiator
and past the engine, while No. 2 was flown with these doors in place. No cowling over the
upper part of the engine was used on either machine, this being freely exposed to the air in
order to dissipate as much heat as po sible directly to the slip stream as it passed over the cylinder heads. Despite all precautionary measures adopted to prevent overheating, great difficulty was experienced in keeping the engine cool during the summer, and it was seldom possible
Lo climb with the throttle fully open for more than a few minutes without raising the water
temperature dangerously near the boiling point.
The two machines used are shown in figure 1~ and general arrangement drawings of the
JN4H are given in figure 2. The more important areas and the weights are tabulated below:

The difference in weight is due to the larger amount of gasoline and oil carried by o. 1
and to the extra tank and oil radiator provided on that machine.
The propellers used on the two maohines were nominally exactly alike, both being made
from the Air Service's design .r o. 13,279, having a diameter of 8 feet 6 inches, and being designed for an effective pitch of 5.22 feet. Actually they were quite different, the propeller

considerably less than it was supposed to be. The other propeller checked extremely well with
the drawings, the mean blade ana-les for the two blades being oorrect within 0°.1 at all radii
except within three inches of the tip, where the angle of setting was too large by 0°.35. The
effect which this. difference between the two propellers had on the results of the tests will
be discussed elsewhere.
The most important factor from ' an aerodynamic standpoint is, of course, the type, form
and arrangement of the main supporting surfaces. The wing section was accordingly checked
u;p by direct measurement at several points on each machine, a frame being used which encircled
the wing and provided base lines for measuring the cambers on both the upper and the lower

curve by having a smaller camber on both surfaces. The maximum discrepancy between the
Eiffel 36 and the mean wing section for th e two machines was 0.006 of the chord, or approximately three-eighth inch, on the upper surface, and a very little less on the lower surface.
The actual curve on the upper surface was considerably moother than that of the Eiffel 36,
the latter section having a rather abrupt change of curvature one-third of the way back from
the leading edge. The mean section for the actual wings and the Eiffel 36 are plotted in figure

The difference between the mean sections for the two machines was negligible, being less
than 0.002 of the chord at every point, and less than 0.001 at most points. Airplane No.2

one. Although the differences happened to counterbalance each other 0 that the mean se('tions were nearly identical, the extreme divergencies between the cambers at corresponding
points on the di[erent wing were by no means negligible. For example, the ordinates for ono
lower wing on No.2 were uniformly greater than tho e for the other lower wing on the ::lame
machine, the difference ometimes amounting to as much a 0.004 of the chord. It is improbable that 'wings can be manufactul'ed by ordinary produetion methods ,yith a greater uniformity
of section than that found in these two machines, and, even if they could be made originally
with greater accuraoy, wooden rib. will not bold tbeir curvature exactly when submitted to
varying climatic condition. Wind tunnel experiment indicate that the effect of changing
the camber of an aerofoil by 0.004 of the chord is seldom 'erious, so long ,'IS the surface retains
a smooth curvature, except in very thick ection uch as are used in propeller blades and in
internally braced airplanes such a the Fokker biplano and triplane. It appears to be fair to
assume that the differences in section among the wing used on these machines will have no
effect on their characteristics and that the mean section, a shown in figure 3, can be assumed
to exist at all points.
The discrepancy between the actual form of the wing section and the curve on which it
was supposed to be based points a dual lesson. In the fil'st place, it dl'aws attention to thf'
need of making wind-tunnel models to represent the airplane as it is actually builL, or to be
built, not merely according to specifications which the shop may find itself quite unable to
follow. It is of little use to construct model aerofoils accurato to within 0.002 inch if the fullsized wing which they represent departs by as much as three-eighths of an inch from the section
which it is supposed to follow. Secondly, these measur ments should serve to remind experimenters engaged in the design of wing sections of the futility of drawing forms which it is impossible to construct by ordinary methods. For instance, no airplanf' wing is constructed with the
upper and lower surfaces running out until they intersect in a perfectly sharp trailing edgf'.
Indeed, it is practically impossible to construct a model aerofoil for the wind tunnel with such
a trailing edge, yet aerofoils are repeatrdly dnnm up in such forms. The result is that the
model maker exercises his own judgment as to the extent to which the trailing edge should
be rounded over, the airplane builder introduces a strip of wood or of steel tube for a trailing
edge, and the iliawing, the model, and the full-sized wing are likely ultimately to be of thref'
quite different forms.
In the JN4H, the thrust line is parallel to the top longerons and the stabilizer, which is
flat on its lower surface, lies directly on the longerons. A detailed discussion of the actual
form and setting of the tail surfaces is of interest primarily in connection with the longitudinal balance of the machine, and it will be I' served for treatment in connection with that
subject. The wings are nominally set at an angle of 2° to the top longerons, but the mean
angle of incidence in both of the machines used in this work was somewhat grea.ter than tha.t
being 2°.25 in o. 1 and 2°.4 in o. 2. The variation 01 incidence along the wing, due to
warping, to slightly imperfect rigging, and to the droop provided in the left wing to balance
the propeller torque, was about 0°.3. The ailerons were rigged as nearly as possible to form
a continuation of the upper wing, so that, when the stick was centered, the angles of incidenc.e
of the portions of the upper wing which carries the ailerons were very nearly the same as for
the inner par t of the wings. A small chang in the rigging of the ailerons when in the neutral
position has a marked effect on the lift and dTag eoeilici nts of the wings.
CALIDRATION OF INSTRUME 'TS.

The first step in the making of any test is necessarily a study of the accuracy and a determination of the calibration curves of the instruments employed . The standard instruments,
used in all tests, are the altimeter, the tachometer, anel the aiT-sp ed meter. The altimeter can
ince the altimeter was used, in most of
readily be calibrated in the laboratory under a bell jar.
t hese experiments, only for determining the density correction, and since most of the work was
carried out at less than 4,000 feet altitude, the permissible percentage error in altitude determina144189-20-2

ANNUAL B.EPORT NATIONAL ADVIS ORY CO MMTTTEE "FOB AERONAU TI S .

tion was quite large. An errol' of 130 feet in the altimeter reading, 01' more than 4 per cent at 3,000
feet , affects the density determination by only one-half pCI' cen t . The effect of such ;minor fflCtors
as the decrease of static pressure in the cockpit, due to the slip-stream velocity, can therefore .
be neglected. It is usually possible, at the t ime of calibrating the albmeter , to adjust the
instrument so that the errors are negligible in such work as this at altitudes of less than 4,000
feet, and the scale readings can therefore be used directly VI'ithout resort to a calibration curve.
The tachometers used were made by the Van Sidden Co. an d were of the chronometric
type. No caJ,ibration of these instruments was adjudged necessary, as the read ings of the
instruments in the front and rear checked, and as a cm'onometric t achomet r can generally
be counted on to give readings very nearly correct so long as it gives any l' adings at all. If
anything goes wrong the instrument usually stops recording entirely.
The calibration of the air-speed meters presents a much mol' serious problem than does that
of either of the instruments just discussed, for several reasons. Thore are several possible
sources of errol' in the air-speed determination. In the firs t place, the motel' itself may be
in error initially or may go wrong after some use. Errors of this type can be determined by
calibration of the meter in a wind tunnel. In the second place, the pitot or venturi tube
used for measuring the velocity head being located close to the machine and in air disturbed
by the passage of the wings the velocity of the air past this tube is, in general, different from
the velocity of the airplane relative to the undisturbed air. For example, the vortex theory of sustentation declares that there is, superposed on the rectilinear flow of air relative to the wing, a
cyclic flow around the wing, so that the relative air speed above the wing is higher, and that
below the wing lower, than the speed through undisturbed air. An air-speed meter having
its head placed close above the wing would therefore give too high a reading, no matter how
closely the instrument might have calibrated in the laboratory. Finally, the air-speed meter
will not give a perfectly corroct reading if the axis of the head is not parallel to the relative
wind direction at that point. Inclination of the head to the relative wind results from the
diversion of the air flow by interference, a diversion which ext ends to a considerable distance
forward of the wings, and also from the changing attitude of an air-speed meter head fixed
in the machine as the angle of attack is altered.
Since practically all free-flight testing requires the determination of the air speed from a
meter the accuracy of that instrument is of great importance. In the determination of lift
coefficients, for example, an error of one-half mile an hour in the measurement of the air
speed at its mean value (about 65 miles per hour for t he IN 4H) has as bad an effect on the final
result as would an error of 400 feet in the altitude determination. It is essential, therefore,
that the instrument be calibrated in place on the airplane and that the calibration be repeated
at intervals to guard against changes in the meter.
The air-speed meters used in these tests were Bristol instruments. They were graduated
with a division at each mile, but the scale was uniform enough and open enough so that it was
easy to estimate the reading to h alf a mile an hour. The heads were pitot-venturi tubes
of the standard Army type, and were mounted on the left inner forward interplane strut, about
18 inches above the lower wing. The inner strut is preferable to the outer one because of the
smaller leng th of tubing required to make connection to the meter and also because the flow
of air at the inner strut is more nearly parallel to the plane of symmetry of the airplane, the
relative air velocity at the outer strut having a considel'able component parallel to the Y axis,
which would cause the air to strike the tubes obliquely and so give false indications.
There ar e two classes of methods used for calibrating air-speed meters in position. The
first, much used by the British, involves the use of a camera obscura for the determination of
speed over the ground. The speed wi th which the image of the airplane crosses the field of
view can be measured with great accuracy, but the ground speed for a given rate of travel of
the image is directly proportional to the altitude, and the altitude must therefore be determined
within one-half per cent or better, an accuracy beyond the reach of any altimeter. The altitude
can best be determined by the use of a second camera obscura or of a theodolite in conjunction

with one camera obscura, the vertical angles of the plane as seen from two different points at
the instant when it crosses a line connecting those two points giving the necessary data for
computing the altitude. The effect of the wind can be determined and corrected for either
by measuring the velocity of a puff of smoke fired from the airplane or- by flying across the
field of view in three different directions, one after the other, and measuring the ground speed
in each direction . 'fhere is only one camera obscura at Langley Field, and it was not deemed
advisable to secure another. The camera obscura therefore has not been used for calibrating
the air-speed meters in these tests.
The second method, and the one so far used in the work of the Jational Advisory Committee, is simpler and more direct, requiring only the timing of the airplane over a measured course.
The course laid off at Langley Field is 5,600 feet long, and two horizontal wires, one directly
above the other and about 3 feet apart, are carried on poles at each end. One of these observing stations is shown in figure 5. The air-plane was flown over the course at an altitude of from
200 to 1,000 feet, the higher altitudes generally being used at the lower speeds, where there
was some danger of stalling or side slipping or starting a spin. The pilot kept the speed a
nearly constant as possible and the observer recorded the air-speed meter reading every 5
seconds. Two or three runs were made in each direction at each speed, the speeds at which
the meter was calibrated being spaced about 5 miles per hoUT from the maximum down to the
mllllmum. The ground speed of each run is determined by observers at the ends of the course,
the two stations being in telephouic communication. The effect of the wind is eliminated,
assuming that its direction and velocity do not change between runs, by computing the mean air
speed for successive runs made approximately at the same speed and plotting it against the
mean ground speed for the same runs. This method is much more satisfactory, when the
pilot is skillful enough to make his runs at
air speeds very nearly uniform and close
to the desired speeds, than any attempt
to measure the component of wind velocity

along the course and correct each run
for the effect of that component, as both
direction and velocity of the wind are so

little information as to the conditions existing at three or four hundred feet. If the
wind is blowing across the speed course, or
at an angle to it, the machine should be kept

speed is greater than the component of
ground speed parallel to the course, in whichever direction flown, and the timing over the ground
of a machine flown in this manner would thet'efore give too low a mean true speed. In
figure 6a, on the other hand, the two quantities just mentioned are exactly equal.
The calibration cm'ves found in this way for the meters in the rear cockpits of the two
machines are plotted in figure 7. It will be observed that they follow the same general form,
the relative displacement between the two curves probably being due to an error in one of the
instruments. It might be expected that the meter would read low at very low speeds and
large angles of attack, due to the inclination of the head to the relative wind, but it actually
appears to read high. This result has been obtained in tests on both airplanes, and there is

little doubt of its accUTacy, although the error in calibration at low speeds is greater than that
at high, both because the effect of wind variations is more marked at low speeds and because

DETERMINATION OF LIFT AND DRAG COEFFICIENTS: METHODS EMPLOYED.

It is very de irable that data be obtained on the lift and drag in free flight of full-sized airplanes and parts thereof, in order that the de igner m ay gain ome knowledge as to the corrections to b e applied to wind-tunnel results and as t o the extent to which those results can be
trust ed. The problem is an extremely difficult one for m any reasons, some of which will be discu sed in detail later on in this report, and the work which has so far been done leaves much that
is uncertain and many questions the solution of which can not even be attempted until new
types of instruments and more accurat e experimental methods have been devised.
There are three methods which have been suggested and employed to ome extent for finding the lift in flight. The first two permit of the determination of the lift of separate parts (in
particular , the wings) , while th e thll'd, the simplest, and th e only one which has been used in the
work done at Langley Field, gives only the lift coefficients for the airplane as a whole. The first
and most obvious of these methods proposes the measurem ent of the lift of any part by the
interposition of weighing devices between that part and the remainder of the airplane. For
example, the wing hinge might be att ached t o the body through the medium of springs.
There h as been a great deal of discu ion of the possibilities of this method, but the mechanical
difficulties are considerable, and not much actual work h as been done. The second method
depends on the measurement of the pressure at a large number of points on the surface of the
wings (and, if desired, on the t ail of the body) and the determination of the tutal lift by the
integration of the e pressUTes over the whole surface. This has been used to some extent
in England, and similar work is planned for Langley Field dUTing the coming year. The pressures can be measured, once the apparatus is satisfactorily constructed, with great ease and accu-

racy, and the only errors to which the method i. subject are tho e inherent in all free-flight
measurements.
The third method is, as was ju t noted, the simplest, in that it requires the least special
apparatus.

In the equat.ion L = L c x ~ X V2 it is kno\>\'ll that L is equal to the weight of the mag

chine when the flight path is horizontal, and that it departs only very slightly frt>m that figure
ince p can be computed from
for any ordinary inclination of the path ( hOl'L of 11 steep dive).
measurements of the pressure and temperature, the determination of Lc requires only the mea urement of V. As a matter of fact, since the air- peed meter records not the true speed but the
product of V X -J plpo, the term pig can be eliminated by the substitution of indicated for true air
speed, and the equation above can be written:
L=L oCV21
Where C is a correction constant taking into account the gravity constant g and the conversion
factor changing VI from miles per hours to feet pel' second. Although a small part of the lift is
due to the body and the tail surfaces have a ub tantial effect at some angle, it is convenient to
divide the lift by the wing area and write the above equation in the form
L = L cCAV 21
With a good meter and careful calibration the air speed can certainly be determined with an
error of less than 1 mile per hour and probably Ie s than 1- mile per hour, and the lift coefficient
at any given in tant during a flight can therefore be computed very accurately. In substituting for L in the characteristic equation, nJlowance h as to be made for the progl'es ive diminution of weight by the comsumption of fu el and for the direct balancing of part of the weIght
of the machine by the vertical componen t of the propeller thrust.
Since the lift coefficient is a function of angle of attack, it is of very little u ' e to compute the
value of the coefficient at any instant during a flight unless this angle at the ame in tant is
known, and it is in th e determination of thi angle that the greatest difficulties arise. The conventional type of "incidence indicator," embodying a pivoted vane and two P itot tubes at a con iderable angle to each other or a sphere pierced with two holes, is usele unle~ ome other mean i
employed to calibrate it in po ition, as the instrument ha to be placed in air disturbed by the
passage of the airplane, and the motion of the in ·trumcnt relative to this di turbed air, as already
noted in connection with the calihration of the air- peed meter', may be of quite a different
nature from its motion relative to the air at a great distance. The di tUl'bance of the au'by the
wings extends to 0 great a di tance (three or four chord lengths) in front of the leading edge
that it is impracticable to carry the incidence indicator far enough forward entu'ely to e cape
this disturb ance.
Since the angle of attack is the incrn1ation of the wings to the rclativ-e wind, it is equal to
the difference between the inclination of the wings to any fixed reference plane and the inclination
of the relative wind to the same plane. In particular, the angle of attack can be determined if
instruments are available which will give the angle between any line fixed in the airplane
and the horizontal and between the relative wind and.the horizontal. The first of the these angles
is given, provided that the machine is in steady rectilinear flight, by a liquid longitudinal inclinometer. The second can not readily be determined directly, but the inclination of the flight
path to the horizontal is given by a rate-of-climb meter in conjunction with an air-speed meter,
and this is equivalent to the inclination of the relative wind if the movement of the air is
exactly horizontal. In the par ticular ca e where the flight path i level the rate-of-climb meter
can be replaced by a statoscope . The large t error in the determination of angle of attack by
this method ari es from the as umption that the air moves only horizontally. An a cending
current having a velocity of only 1 foot per econd change the angle of attack, for a given
attitude of the machine relative to the earth, by nearly 0°.7 at an air speed of 60 miles per
hour. This is a very gentle a cencling cUlTent, and it will be hown later that vertical currents
which have actually been encountered dming the e experiment have affected the apparent angle
of attack by more than 1°.
THe statoscope used is sho wn in figure 9. The tube was kept separate from the vacuum
flask, instead of mounting both in one case a is customary, in order that the flask might be

placed behind the instrument board and the space occupied ou the board be kept down to a
mmuuum. The u e of th e stato cope makes it practicable to keep the mean rate of climb or
descent down to 20 feet per minute except at Yery large angles of attack, and a rate of climb
of 20 feet per minu te affects th e angle of attack at 60 mile per hour by less than 0°.25.
The ordinary commercial type of longitudinal inclinometer proved unsatisfactory, fu'st,
because the !'cale was not op en enough to permit the angles to be read as closely as was desired,
and, second, because the face of the in trument was perpendicular to the in trument board. The
observer's eye being well above the board, the observer looked down on top of the meni cus and
across it at the scale behind, and the parallax error was large. An in trument was designed to
obviate these difficulties, and is shown a sembled in figure 10. Fio-ure 11 illustrates the tube
removed from the case. The front tube and sca.le ma.ke an ano-le of 20° with the surface which
rests against the instrument board. The mean distance between the two urfaees of the column
of 'l iquid is 8 inches. The scale i divided in degrees, the divisions being roughly one-eighth
inch apart, and it is easy to estimate to 0°.1. The liquid is a mixture of glycerin and alcohol,
colored with red ink. The damping of 0 cillations depends on the visco ity of the liquid, and
this can be controlled by varying the proportions of alcohol and glycerin. The tu be is constricted at one point to increase the clamping. Parallax was avoided by mounting a mirror
be ide the instrument, the ob erver bringino- the reflection of his eye in line with the meniscus.
It unfortunately has not been pos ible to base the mea urements of the drag entir ely on
data obtained in flight, as no . atisfactory means of measuring the propeller thrust is available
as yet. It is therefore necessary to rely on a wind tunnel test for the propeller characteristics.
A par tial check can be obtained on th e wind tunnel re ult by measuring the slip-stream velocity, as described in another section of the report. Knowing the revolutions per minute and

the velocity of the vertical current and to the LID ratio, inversely proportional to the speed of
flight. If the rising current had a vertical velocity of 11 feet per second, the air speed and LID
being the same as before, no thrust would be required and the machine would soar without
engine power. Such currents as this eldom if ever exi t, but rising and falling currents of
smaller velocities are almost omnipresent. They account for many seemingly wild results in
this and other similar work, and the only way to eliminate their effects i to run a great number
of tests of the same sort, under all light and weather conditions and over as many different types
of terrain as possible, and then avemge the result.
Figure 13 shows the instrument board in thc observer's cockpit of o. 1, with inclinometer,
air-speed meter, Itltimeter, and tachometer installed. The altimeter does not appear in this
photograph, being hidden behind the cowling at the right. The arrangement in No.2 is practically the same.
The tests were carried out at altitudes varying from 1,500 to 4,000 feet. It was not considered safe, in view of the danger of falling into a spin when flying at large angles and of the
possibility of a forced landing, to work below the former altitude. The altitude chosen on any
particular day depends chiefly on air conditions, the climb being continued far enough to escape
the ({ bumps" frequently found near the grou nd. -Each ({ run" continued for from 1 to 2 minutes, the pilot being in tructed to fly level (using the statoscope to detect changes in altitude)
and at a constant air speed during that period. The ob erver read and recorded the readings of
the air-speed meter, the inclinometer and the tachometer every 10 seconds, and noted the altimeter reading and the ail' tempemture at the beginning of each run. The pilot' task was a
very difficult ono, for he had con tnutly to watch the statoscopo and ail'- peed meter, in addition to holding the machine steady laterally and watching out for other airplanes. Besides
all this, when flying over the speed course to calibrate the meter the pilot had to steer a traight
course over tho ground between the two ob ervinO' tations. T est flying i a very highiy specialized branch of work, the difficultie. of which are noL O'enerally appreciated, and there is no type
of flying in which a difference between the abilitie of pilots thoroughly competent in ordinary
flying becomes mOl'e quicldy apparent. Most of the piloting for the committee has been done
by Mr. E. T. Allen and Lieut. H. M. Cronk, but seven other pilots have been used on one or more
occaSIOns.
In order to determine the minimum peed in teady flight and to secure data for comparison
with wind tunnel te t over the whole range of angl cu tomarily covered by the latter, it was
necessary to fly horizontally at an angle at loa t equal to the angle of maximum lift and a much
larger as possible. The procedure in attaining the e high angles wa to throttle the engine to
the lowest speed at which level flight could be maintained, and then open the throttle gradually.
drawing the tick back at the arne time. The airplane can thus be flown level in a very badly
stalled condition, the action of the longitudinal controls being rever ed (i. e., if the machine i
losing altitude it is nece sary to decrea e the angle of attack, pushing the stick forward, in order
to ascend) . Furthermore, the airplane is very un table laterally at angles in excess of 12° or
13 °, and it i prone to fall off into side slip. Most pilots in trying to fly at extremely high
angles for the first time, arc unable to keep the machine in equilibrium for more than a few
seconds. One of the pilots flying for the committee, after considerable practice, became very
skillful in this work and found it possible, given favorable weather conditions, to maintain
steady level flight for an indefinite period with the throttle wide open and the Irh'1.chine stalled
to an angle of attack of 1 ° or a little more. The ailerons alone are very ineffective in maintaining lateral stability at large angle, as any raising of one aileron greatly dirnini hes the drag
on that portion of the wing, while drawing down the other aileron correspondingly increases the
drag there. The result is that a large yawing moment, nearly if not quite sufficient to overcome
the effect of the rolling moment due to the aileron , i produced and tends to force the machine
into a spin. It is necessary constantly to use the rudder in conjunction with the ailerons to a
considerably larger extent than is nec~ ary at normal angles.

RESULTS OF THE TESTS FOR LIFT COEFFICENTS.

A number of tests (about 10) were Il1.£1,de on each airplane. Some of these have not been
'
plotted up or included in the averages, either because they were not extended over a large
enough range of angles or because they contained results which were self-contradictory or because it was found, wh en an attempt was made to work them up, that essential data were lacking. I n selecting test to be incorporated in the final tabulation no attempt was made to pick
those which would check well with each other, and the results were not even compared until the
final choice h ad been made and the computations complet ed. In order to indicate the degree
of consistency obtained among the various factors on successive observations in one typical
flight, the angle of attack, as determined by the inclinometer, is plotted against the indicated
air speed in figure 14. As already noted, observations on the two instruments were taken

th l'oughou t . The very large discrepancy between these three and the fourth a t large angles may be
explained by the failure of th e pilot in the July 30 test to hold the path level. In seeking to fly
at the lowest possible speed, he proba,hly allowed the machine to settle 01' "pancake," so that
th e true lift was less than the weight of the airplane.
The mean lift curves for No . 1 and No.2 are brought together in figure 16. The difference
between the two is unfor tuna tely not so small as that between the eurves for the various tests on
a single machine, and the reason for the discrepancy is not apparent. Th e difference between
the two machines certainly is not great enough to account for it, although the reserve tank in
the upper wing of No.1 might affec t the lift by a small amount. However, even if the difference between the two lift curves be regarded as wholly due to error in the experiments, the two
are nearly enough alike to indicat e th e general form of the curve and to permi t of in teresting
deductions.

PRELIMIN ARY REP ORT ON FREE FLIGHT TESTS.

The mos t importan t result that can be drawn from such work as this rela tes to the comparison between free-flight an d wind-tunnel results. It has not been p ossible as yet to have' an
accurato model of the JN4H made up for wind-tunnel test , bu t a great deal of work has been done
on the JN2', and this can be used as a basis of comparison. The JN2 h as an Eiffel 36 wing-section, like the IN 4H, but it differs from the lat t~r in that its wings are of equal span and in a number of other details. The JN2 has a larger down load on the tail than has the 4H, as will be
shown in connection with the discussion of balance, and th e actual lift of the wings must therefore be gr eater. It would then be expected, other things being equal, that the lift coefficients
here compu ted, which ignore th e tail load entirely, would be ' a little smaller for the 2 than for
the 4H, but the difference would hardly exceed 3 per cent .

The lift coefficient for the J N2 model and the mean coefficient for the two full-siz ed machin es
are given in figure 17. The coefficients for the model, like those for the full-sized machine, are
based on the lift of the whole airplane and not on that of the wings alone. The two curves run
fairly close together up to 6°, although th e lift of the model is distinctly the larger, even when allowance is made fo], the effect of th e difference in tail load just m~ntioned . The model lift coefficient at angles below 6° is larger th an that given by the free-flight tests for either o. lor J o.2.
At angles in excess of 6° the model lift coefficient begins to drop off rapidly by comparison with the
free-fligh t valu es. The burble point for the former come at an angle nearly 4 ° smaller thftn that
for the latter, and its m aximum lift is about 15 per cent Ie s, so that th e minimum speed, or, as itis

than that found by experiment. Actually, however, the model ·test gives the practicable lancl1

ing speed more closely than d oes the fI'ee-flight test, for the customary angle of attack in a good
landing is about 12°, an angle at which the lift coefficienti almost exactly equal to the maximum
lift coefficien t of the model. In order to land the machines which were til subject of the e tests
at the lowe t speed at which they can be flown, the tail skid would have to touch the ground
while the wheels were still 16 inches above its surface (assuming the downward lope of the
flight path at the inst ant of m aking contact to be 2°). As every pilot will recognize, a landing in
such an attitude would be distinctly unu ual,to say the least. A has a.lrearly been pointed out,
it requires exceptional skill to fly at nngl s of 15° Or more, and it wou ld not be safe for any pilot
to attemp t it near th e ground.. I t is, therefore, evident that the burble point is of very little
prn,ctical interest in airplane design, as i t is improbahle that any pilot vel' flies his machine at
that angle voluntarily except for a very brief interval in the course of a stunt 01' when testing for
minimum speed. Whethe r or not the rule hinted
at above, that the lift coefficient at the largest

the runs during this flight were made over the
water (H ampton Roads) at a maximum distance of about a mile from the land and others, at
nearly the sarile spe'eds, over the land . Whi'm the results were worked up it was found that the
J'W 1S over th e water and those over the land gave two di tinct sets of curves, and that the angle
of attack for a speed of 78 miles per h our was greateT by 1° on the 11l'St set than on the second.
This leads to the conclusion that the ai r was descending over the water or ascending over the
land or both , and that the vertical velocity of the air in one place relative to that in the other
was 120 feet per minu te. This is undoub tedly an exceptional condition, as ubsequent tests,
although they frequen tly sh owed a difference in angle with the kind of country over which the
machine was passing, indicated no other vertical velocities as large as that just mentioned. It
sh ould be noted that the flight just descri bed took place in the morning, on a unny day, and that
all the observations Were taken at a height of 2,700 feet. Since the results obtained on the runs
over the land ch ecked well with the other tests on the same machine it i probable that the
\Terticnl velocity there was not very large, and that most of the relative movement deduced was
due to a downward motion of air over the bay, or at least over that portion of it covered by
the flight.

A much disputed qne tion rela e to the effect of the slip-stream on the lift of an airplane.
Although no a tempt at <fuantitative m a urements in inclined flight ha. a yet been made, the
minimum peed attainable has been observed under vaTiou condition of engine operation, and
no indication of a marked slip-stream effect on lift ha been apparent.
ome such effect probably
exists, but it is certainly mall. The minimum speed with throttle wide open is, to be sure, omcwhat les than the minimum peed in aliding, but the difference is not too large to be accounted
for by the lesser total lift in the first case, due to the vertical component of the thrust-balancing
part of the weight of the machine directly.
RESULTS OF TH,E TESTS FOR DRAG COEFFICIENTS.

In working up the results of the tests for drag the procedure followed was in general analogous to that just described for lift. The primary curve, corresponding to the plot of inclinometer
readings against speed, was one of Nri against angle or speed (usually the latter).

Such a CUTve

for a single flight is given in figUTe 18, each point repre enting a single pair of readings (of airspeed meter and tachometer). It will be noted that the points do not lie on the curve with any
such exactness as do those in figure 14, and that they separate into little groups. Each group
of points includes the readings taken dUTing a run in a straight line and at an approximately
constant speed, and each group defines a little curve of its OWll, the slopes of these short subsidiary
curves being considerably greater than that of the mean curve connecting them. This apparent
discrepancy is due to the inertia of the airplane, which causes it to delay appreciably in responding to changes of condition. For

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERO.r AUTICS.

The difference between successive tests was, as would be expected, greater than in the case
of the lift coefficient, both because of the very large effect of vertical Clf!l'l'ents and because of the
failure of the pilots in orne cases to keep the path level. The extreme results for a given angle,
however, seldom varied by more than 10 per cent. The elTors in the determination are much
greater at very large and at very small angles than at those in the neighborhood of tho maximum
L ID, partly because there were few tests which extended to very large angles. Even those test
which covered the full ranO'e of angles spread ou t widely at the ends of the curves, although very
closely hunched in the intermediate portion. There wa ,a will be seen n. littl e later, a marked
difference between the results for the two machines, exceeding 10 per cent for a considerable
range of angles. This difference can be attributed largely to the difference in the propellers, a
difference already noted in the first part of the report, and it is probable that, since the propeller
used on No.2 wa the morc warped, the result given for the drag and LID on No.1 are more
accurate than are those for No.2. A test was made with the propellers interchanged, and the
results obtained from o. 2 on that occasion checked very well with the mean curve for J o . 1.
The mean curves of thrust for the two machines are given in figure 19. These curves call
for no special comment, their O'enel'al form being evident. The thrust for a given angle varies

represent the average condition in the IN in level flight satisfactorily. The thru t given in these
CUTves is that corresponding to tandard atmospheric den ity.
.
The curves of horsepower required for level flight at standard density are given in figure 20.
The curve for horsepower available is plotted on the same sheet, its form being based on the
efficiency curve for the propeller, as determined at Leland tanford Junior, and on the computed
variation of engine speed with airspeed, the throttle remaining wide open at all times and the
engine torque being assumed constant. In order to make the inter ection of the curves check
with the maximum speed as determined by test it was necessary to take the engine horsepower
as 130 (a value which appears reasonable, a the engine had seen a considerable amount of
service and would not turn up beyond 1,530 revolutions per minute in level flight with the propeller
normally usen on No. I , or 1,570 revolutions per minute with that used on o. 2). It will be
noted that the curves of horsepower available and required have their second intersection at an
angle a little smaller than the bUTble point. This checks very well with the observed fact that,

with the throttle wide open and the miLchine flying level, it was not quite po ibJ e to reach the
bUTble point. This is shown by the mean lift curves, which stop just short of the critical angle.
This coincidence of computed and obserTed result at the lower end of the horsepower curve
affords additional reason for confidence in the validity of the method employed for using windtunnel data on the propeller in conjunction with measurements on the complete airplane in free
flight.

The air speed for best climb is deduced from the ho1'sepow r cun-es to be 36 miles per hoUl".

"ide-open tln-ottle would presumably he to rai e the speerl for minimum hor cpowcr required,
and the speed for besL climb predicted from the e CUl"ves would thereforc be expected to be a
little low. In any Cilse, however, the discrepancy i mall, and the climbing peod is so nearly
the same for all speeds from 50 to 60 miles per hour that the differenre 'nn harcUy be detected.
The climbing peed for o. 1 is computed from the horsepower eUl"ve to be 5 5 feet a minu c.

Although, as already noted, no accurate determinations of the ra,te of climb have been made, such
observ ations as have been taken indicate a maximwu r ate somewhat less than 585 feet a minut e.
T his is what would be expec ted, the difference being due to the increased slip-stream effect with
open throttle. The curve of horsepower r equired computed fr om the JN2 model test, with due
allowance for the difference in weight between the JN2 and the J 4H, is a]so plotted in figure 20.
I t checks well wi th the free fligh t curves except at extr eme h.igh an llow speeds. From the curves
of thrust those for L ID can be derived, and the mean cur es for the two machines, together with
that for the J N2 model referred to in conn ection with the lift coefficients, are givon in figure 2l.
Tho curve for No. 1 and No. :2 are nearly parallel excep t at small angles, where there appears
a marked difference of slope similar to t hat which characterized the lift curves. Bearing in
mind the Jact t,hat the curyO for No. 1 is un doub tedly mor e accw'ate than that for IO. 2, it is
appar en t th at the correspondence between the L ID fo r the J :2 model and that determined
in free fligh t for the JN4H is reasonably good. It is r ather dangerous to ·dra,,- fine conclusions
from this correspondence, in view of the difference between the JN2 and the JN4H, but the separation b tween the curves is h ar dly greater at any point than the combined possible experimental
orrors, and the m axima diffor by only :2 per cen t (if the curve for No . 1 be takon as correct) .
Tho indication i that the slip- tream effect and the variou crudities of construction on the modol
(such a. t he use of round wire interplane tr uts) ar o almost exactly eounterbalanced by the

slip stream were both connected to the same meter through tho medium of two valves, which
made it possible to change readily from one to the other, and to read the air speed or lip-stream
velocity, as might be desired. The readings secured in this way are, of course, not highly accurate, a the lip- tream velocity includes a considerable tangential component, the magnitude of
this swirl varying \\-ith the air speed and engine speed. The air therefore meets the tubes obliquely, and the reading of the meter i probably lower than the true velocity. The error in
velocity should not, however, be more than 5 per cent, and the results obtained will at least
erve to give an idea of the relation between slip-stream velocity and the factors which control it.
The procedure in these tests was to set the throttle at a fIXed position, and to fly the machine at a number of different air speeds without moving the throttle (these flights, of co tu'Sc ,
were not level). The air speeds used for each throttle setting ranged from 90 to 42 miles per
hour, with an occasional dive to 100 miles per hour or a little more. The ratio of slip-stream
velocity-to air speed for a given propeller depends only on JD and these quantities can therefore
be plotted against each other. This has been done in figme 22, and it "ill be noted that nearly all
of the points lie closc to a smooth curve and that there is no distinct break between the sets of
points taken at different throttle openings. The only points which do not Elt the curve are those
which were taken with the engine throttled down to a ,ery low speed, so low that the propeller
was giving no thrust. The slip-stream velocities tulder this condition were lower than they
apparently should have been.
The dotted curve in figure 22 repre ents the velocity ratio computed from the thrust coefficients by the method described in Report o. 71. This curve checks very welj with the other
one, and this check indicates that the thrust coefficient as determined in the wind tunnel
held for the full- ized machine, and that they are not very materially affected by the pre ence
of the body. Of com e, thi check i only a rough one. To ecure an accurate comparison
between the theoretical and actual values it would be nece ary to ound the slip-stream thoroughly, mea w·jng the velocitie at many point, but previous experiment (by Eiffel and others)
indicate that the velocit.y is nearly con tant over a large portion of the propeller di k area, and
readings at a single point therefore give some indication of the average condition. It appears
that interference between the propeller and the other part of the airplane can not have a very
large effect, as any very notable increase in thrust due to the pre 'ence of the body would lead
to an increased slip-stream velocity. Experiment at the Royal Aircraft Factory I on a pusher
biplane, have hown a similarly excellent check between the calculated and mea ured sliptream velocities.
The maximum lip-stream velocity 'w ith the machine ' tationary on the ground and the
engine tmning 1,400 revolution per minute \Va about 0 miles per hour. The velocity was
very unsteady under the condition, the meter r eading varying by about 6 miles per hoUl"
almost instantaneou ly. Thi irregularity of flow was no doubt due in part to interference
of the ground, but the flow in the lip-stream wa in general more irregular, and the velocity
fluctuated more rapidly and through a larger range at low peeds than at high,
LONGITUDINAL BALANCE.

The factor on which the longitudinal balance of an airplane primarily depends, and to any
variation in which it i always highly ensitive, is the position of the center of gravity of the machine. The first step, then, in any study of balance and of the action of the controls is to determine as accmately a possible the position of the C. G. with regard both to its vertical and it
horizontal co-ordinate.
The method used in finding the location of the center of gravity was the usual one of
weighing the machine on three pairs of cale, one under each wheel and one under the tail
skid, first with the tail skid and wheel on the same level and then with the tail raised . The

tail can be raised enough, without overbalancing the machine, to rotate it through an angle
of about 15° when the pilot and ob erver are on board and through 10° when the seats are
empty. From the weights thus obtained the center of gravity can be computed with a probable error of les than 0.01 foot in the horizontal co-ordinate and less than 0.03 footin the vertical.
With a pilot weighing 125 pounds in the front seat and a 1G5-pound observer in the rear
(this being the crew with which most of the tests were conducted), the center of gravity of No.1
was 1.04 feet behind the leading edge of the lower wing, 2.50 feet behind the leading edge of
the upper wing, and 0.28 foot above the thrust line, the axes of reference being taken parallel
and perpendicular to the top longeron. The center of gravity of o. 2 was 0.99 foot behind
the leading edge of the lower wing, 2.44 feet behind the leading edge of the upper wing, and 0.2
foo t above the thrust line. The ob erver in .r o. 2 weighed only 125 pounds. If the mean chord
be taken a 60 per cent of the way from the lower to the upper chord to allow for the larger
area and larger unit lift of the upper wing, the line through the C. G. and perpendicular to the
wing chords cuts this mean chord at 39 per cent of its length from its leading edge on No.1 and
35 per cent on o. 2. This is materially far ther back on the wings than the usual location
for the C. G.
Since the balance depend on moments about the C. G., a small change of force on the tail
planes, acting as it doe at a large moment arm, has an important effect, and the angle of the
stabilizer is therefore of primary importance. As already noted in the general descriptions of
the machines, the stabilizer is supposed to lie flat on the upper longerons . Although the stabilizers were warped the mean chord of the surface was parallel to the top longerons with.iD
0°.2 on both machine .
In order to determine the angle at which the elevator was set at any instant, a sector carrying a scale wa fL'(ed to the elevator rocker-arm shaft in the rear cockpit of No.1, and this sector moved under a pointer fixed to the eat rail. No means of mea uring the control position
were provided on No.2, as the arrangement of the cleva tor-control linkage was different on the
two machines, and an entirely new and somewhat more complicated device would have had to
be designed. The elevator control wires were adj usted somewhat more tightly than is usual
in order to prevent any backlash. The elevator po ition indicator is hown in position in
figure 2'3.
The force applied to the stick was measured by the instrument illustrated in figure 24 .
The knob which normally caps the stick was removed, and the lide held between two springs
wa slipped over the head of the tube. The pilot read the forces directly from the cale. The
force indicator was originally fitted with two springs of equal strength, but, a it was found
that the force was practically always in one direction, the springs hown in the cut were
substituted.
The elevator po ition for a variety of air speeds and engine speeds are given by the curves
of figure 25 . The e curves were obtained in the same way as were the points on the slip-stream
curve (fig. 22), each one relating to a fixed throttle setting. A fixed throttle setting, rather
than a fL'(ed engine power or number of revolut ions pel' minute, is the criterion to which longitudinal balance and stability should be r elated.
Indicated air-speed (with the speed course correction made) is used directly as the basis
for plotting the curves, and variations of air density during the test are entirely neglected:
The elevator angles and for ces depend primarily on indicated air-speed, since the angle of attack
and the flow of air about the machine are functions only of the indicated air-speed and the
slope of the flight path. The air density affects the controls in two ways, but both are of minor
importance. In the first place, the slope of the flight path for a given throttle setting and
indicated air-speed varies with the air density. This factor i insignificant. Secondly, the
velocity of the slip-stream and its effect on the controls depend on the true speed and so on the
density. This effect, although it is of greater magnitude than the one first mentioned, can
safely be neglected except for the large changes of destiny experienced in mounting to great
altitudes. All the test described here were carried out at between 1,500 and 4,000 feet .

Curve No.1 relates to flight with wide-open throttle, o. 5 to gliding descent with the
engine throttled down to idling speed. The eJevator angle is referred to the top longerons as a
datum line, and is taken as positive when the trailing edge of the elevator is pulled down. It
will be observed that the curves all have the same general form, and that the positive angle of
elevator setting for equilibrium at any given speed decreases progressively as the engine speed
decreases . Thi is due to the slip-s tream effect on the stabilizer and to the location of the
center of gravity above the t,hru t line, both of these things tending to cause the an'plane to
nose down to a smaller angle of incidence as the throttle is closed and therefore requn'ing that
the elevator be pulled up in order to maintain the same angle of attack and the same an'-speed.

nose of the an'plane would drop, and would continue to go down at lea t until the speed of t.he
dive reached 90 miles per hour, and probably until the airplane pa sed the vertical and attained
an up-side-down position. It is, of course, desirable that the nose should drop when the engine
is throttled or cut off completely rather than that the machine should stall, but it i also desn'able that the nosing down process should stop at a de terminate point ins tead of continuing
indefinitely. An airplane ideally balanced and ideally stable would continue at some speed
within its normal range and at a normal inclination of path, with the longitudinal control locked
whatever might be done to the throttle. The condition of locked control, of course, is only one
of several which may occur. Others, even more important, will be discussed later in this
section.

It is characteristic of the curve of figure 25 that they have n, maximum point, and that
their slopes at high and low air-speeds are accordingly of opposite sign. The effect of this
change of lope can best be illu ·trated by two concrete examples. If an airplane is flying with
the throttle setting C01'1'e ponding to curve No.3, and at a speed of 65 miles per bour, and if
the stick i then suddenly pushed forward by an amount sufficient to increase the elevator
angle by oo.~ and locked in this new position, the primary effect will be to nose the airplane
down, decfea ing the angle of incidence and increasing the speed, since the pulling down of the
elevator sets up an unbalanced upward force on the tail, and this gives rise Lo a diving moment
about the center of gravity. By the time the speed has increased to 0 miles per hour tbe
proper elevator setting for equilibrium is 0° .7, but the surface is locked at 1 o .~. There is,
therefore, still an unbalanced diving moment, larger now than before, and the speed continues
to incl'ea e with a constantly steepening path. Manifestly this is an unstable condition, and
it may be dangerou if the pilot is not vigilant. Suppose, on the otber hand, tha,t the initial
speed was 50 miles per hour, tbis being less than that corresponding to the maximum elevator
angle, and that the elevator was pulled down O. 2° and locked as before. The fu'st effect, just
as in the other case, is to decrease the angle of incidence and increase the speed. By the time
the speed has increased about 1 mile pel' hour, however, a point is reached where the machine
is in equilibrium with tbe new elevator setting, and it will then continue in steady flight at this
slightly higher speed. Gusts which change the u.ngle of attack of the airplane have just the
same effect as a sudden change in the angle of the elevator. 1£ an airplane wbich is flying
with the control locked at 11 speed corresponding to the negatively sloping portion of the elevator
position curve is struck by a gust which decreases its angle of attack the angle will continue
to decrea e without limit. If the speed is low enough to lie on the positively sloping portion
of the curve the airplane willl'eturn to its original speed and angle of trim as soon as tbe effect
of the gust has passed. A positive lope tberefore makes for longitudinal stability. It will
be noted tbat the range of speed for table fligbt with fixed controls and iL'{ed throttle setting
becomes wider in general as the engine speed is decreased, and that, for tbe lowest curve (engine
idling), tbere is no sbarp negative slope at any point. Witb tbe throttle wide open, on the other
hand, the machine is unstable for practically the whole speed range.
An ideal set of elevator position curves would have a small positive slope at all points,
and the curves for different throttle settings would be parallel and close together.
uch a
set is shown in figure 26 for comparison with the actual curves of figure 25. It is not desirable to have the positive slope very large at any point, as a machine characterized by such
curves is difficult to control quickly, requiring the application of a larger force, and the moving
of the stick through a longer arc, than is desirable to change the angle of attack. The stability with fixed controls can always be controlled by movement of the center of gravity, the
stability being greatest when the C. G. is farthest forward with respect to the wings.
The sudden reversal of the slopes of the urve in figure 25, and the rapidity with which
the elevator setting changes at low speeds, are due to the change of the center of pressure travel
on the wings. This travel becomes Ie s unstable as the angle increases and the effect, when
combined with tbe movements due to the tail, is to give to the whole machine a high degree of
statical longitudinal stability at low speeds.
At all speeds ordinarily used the elevator angle decrease a the angle of attack decreases,
so that it is necessary to hold the stick farther back to fly at high than at moderate speed.
Of course, it is not possible to go directly from one condition to the other, as, for instance, to
decrease the angle of attack by pulling the stick back while flying in equilibrium at a moderate
speed. Tbe effect in that case would be the oppo ite of the one de ired, and it is nece sary,
when the angle is to be decreased, first to push the stick forward , nosing the machine down
until the desired angle is reached, and then to pull it a little farther back than its original position in order to keep the machine in the attitude thu assumed.

PRELIMINARY REPORT ON FREE FLIGHT TESTS.

For the sake of comparison the curve of elevator angles for 0. JN2 has been computed
from tests made at the wind tunnel of the Massachusetts I nstitute of Technology 1 and is given
in figure 27 together with a reproduction of the curve for the JN4H with the engine idling.
In computing the curve for the model the center of gravity was a sumed to be in the same
po ition with regard to the mean chord of the wings as in JN4I-I No. 1. The differences between
the JN2 and the JN4H are not of a nature which would be expected materially to affect the
bala.nce and stability, except that the stabilizer on the former i et at - 3° to the wing chord,
while that on the latter is at - 2°.3. This u.ccounts for a part, but only a part, of the relative
displacement of the two curve. It will be noted that the model test would have led to a prediction of tail-heaviness, the opposite of the condition exi ting. This difference can be attributed

to the fact that the tail of the model was made up as a fiat plate cut from sheet metal and the
difference between inclinations of the zero lift lines of the stabilizers in the model and the fullsized machine was therefore much greater than was the difference in the settings of their chords.
The large error in balance resulting from this error in tail construction points again to the
necessity of minute accuracy in constructing the sustaining and control surfaces of wind tunnel
models.
The two curves of figure 27 are of almost exactly the same form and it appears probable
that, were it not for the error noted above, they would be close enough together so that the
balance of the u.ir plane and the control position in gliding flight, when there is no slip-stream
effect, could be closely predicted from the model test. The present experiments and otherii
of a similar nature on many different types of machines will provide the necessary data for

correcting the wind tunnel re ults for slip- tl'eam effect and so for predi ting the balance of an
, airplane at full power before it is built.
The discus ion so far has been confmed to the case of stability with locked controls. Thi
of course, i rather an uncommon case at present as very few machines, especially of nonmilitary
type, are fitted with means for locking the stick in position. The pro\'1. ion of a device for this
purpose is highly desirable from ome standpoints, and may become the usual thing at ome
future date, but there are other cases which, as already noted, are of more importance at present.
If the elevator is left free and uncontrolled it will take up a position in which there i a
small moment about the elevator hinge, due to the air forces acting on the urface, tending to
decrease the angle. This corresponds to an upward force on the elevator and is required to
balance the weight of the member, which produces a moment tending to increase the angle
of setting. In the machine used in the e te ts a force of 8, pounds at the top of the stick,
corresponding to a moment about the elevator hinge of 206 pound-inches, was required to hold
the" flippers " up in the neutral po ition. A force of 1 pound at the upper end of the stick
balances a moment of 24.2 pound-inche about the elevator hinge. In plotting the results of
the tests the force on the stick and the momen t about the elevator hinge have both been plotted
as ordinates against air peed. Since the ratio between the forces and the moments is fixed
a single urve suffice for both by a proper adjustment of scales.
Before discussing in detail the curves of con trol force , a digression on the definition of nose
heaviness and tail heaviness is appropriate, a.s these terms constantly enter into any question of
longitudinal balance. An airplane may be, and has been, defined as in perfect balance (neither
nose heavy nor tail heavy) either (a) when the pilot does not need to apply any force to the stick
to keep the machine in equilibrium under the particular co nditions in question, (b) when there is
no moment about the elevator hinge, or (c) when the airplane flies in equilibrium with the
elevator forming a prolongation of the stabilizer. The first of th ese definitions is generally the
most satisfactory, and will be used here, as it relates to what the pilot is primarily interested in,
the muscular force required to fly the machine steadily . Its only important disadvantage is
that it makes too much depend on the weight of the elevators, a very minor and easily changed
factor of design, to be really desirable from a scientific point of view. The second of the three
definitions suggested would be better from this standpoint.
The curves of force and moment on the elevators of o. 1 for various throttle settings are
given in figure 28 , those for No.2 in figure 29. The positive sign corre ponds to a pull on the
stick, holding the elevator up against a downward force. The curve marked " level flight"
gives the forces for that condition with both air speed and throttle setting varing. In all cases
the force is a pull on the stick, or, in other words, the airplane is nose heavy. This nose heaviness
could be remedied, at least for any particular speed, or reduced to any desired extent by changing the stabilizer setting, or, what amounts to the same thing, by rigging the wings at a larger
angle of incidence. If the stick on either one of the machines used in these tests is released,
it will move forward from the equilibrium position and the machine will go into a dive with
the throttle wide open. Releasing the stick during gliding de cent also throws the airplane
into a dive, the speed and steepnes of which rapidly increase, apparently without limit.
With free controls, just as with the controls locked, stability is indicated by the slope of
a curve, but it is the curve of control forces in this case instead of that of control positions .
When the slope of the curve of forces is negative, as it is at low speeds in figures 28 and 29,
the machine is stable with free controls, provided that the line of zero force on the stick
intersects the curve of force, as any change of speed would set up moments which would cause
the elevators to move in the proper direction to restore the machine to its original attitude.
When, on the other hand, the slope is positive the equilibrium is unstable and can only be
restored, once it is upset, by the intervention of the pilot. It is evident from the curves that
with free controls, just as with the controls locked, the statical longitUdinal stability is greatest
at low speeds of flight, that the machine becomes unstable at speeds in the neighborhood of the
maximum attainable, and that the stability is greater in gliding than with the throttle open.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERO AU TICS.

The chief difference between statical tability with locked and free controls is that equilibrium
can be e tabli hed at any speed in the former case by locking the controls in the proper position
while there is only one po sible speed of flight and angle of attack with free controls (for a
given weight of elevator). The stability with free controls is therefore uffi ient if the curve
of forces cuts the line of zero force at one and only one point, the force being negative at all
peed higher than that corresponding to the point of equilibrium defined by the intersection
of this curve and axi , positive at all speeds lower. It therefore does not matter if there are
one or more" kinks," involving changes in the sign of the slope, in the force curve, provided
only that they do not rcach or cross the axis. For completely satisfactory stability with
locked controls, however, tho slope of the curvo must be positive at every point throughout
the range of peeds likely to be reached.
As ha been pointed out, the machine used in these tests were nose heavy under practically all conditions, but this can ea ily be corrected, if desired, by setting the stabilizer at a
larger negative angle relative to the wings. If greater tability or stability over a wider range
of peeds i required it can be secur d by moving the center of gravity forward, just as in the
ca e of fixed controls. The natural tendency, when a machine i no e heavy, is to seek to
cure it by moving the center of gravity farther back. Where, however, as in this case, the
nose heavine is a companied by in tability, moving the C. G. aft will only serve to aggravate
the latter difficulty. If the C. G. is moved at all it should be moved forward. Changing the
stabilizer setting so a to give an increased downward force on the tail, on the other hand,
improves the balance and, a will be shown later, also has some beneficial effect on the stability
with free controls. The exact effect of changing the stabilizer setting is difficult to predict
unless an exhaustive series of tests on pressure distribution over the elevator is available (such
tests have never been made except for one machine), as the moment about the elevator hinge
depends laro-ely on the position of the center of pre ure on the elevator, and this is a very
uncertain quantity. If the center of pres ure position is assumed to be unaffected by the
changes in elevator angle to ecure equilibrium at a given speed with a changed stabilizer
etting, the alteration in moment about the hinge, due to the different stabilizer angle, is almost
exactly proportional to the quare of the peed, as the change in elevator angle for equilibrium
is very nearly the same for all peeds. The slop,e of the curve of forces on the stick, under
the e condition, would decrea e in algebraic value if the stabilizer angle were decreased, and
the tendency would be toward stability. From this the deduction can be drawn that stability
with free controls can not be obtained at any given speed merely by changing the stabilizer
setting unle s the machine was originally nose heavy at the designated speed and all lower
speeds of fligh. Furthermore, an airplane the curve for which is unstable (i. e., has a positive
slope) throughout the range of normal speeds of flight can not be made stable with free controls
at any speed whatever by changing the stabilizer setting unle s it is initially nose heavy at all
point of its speed range. Although the e deductions are ba ed on an a sumption not strictly
true they check well with experiment and furnish a fair basis for reasoning. It follows from
the foregoing conclusions that the maximum positive angle to which an adjustable stabilizer
can be moved should depend on the behavior of the machine in a steep descent with the throttle
open. For stability, the force on the tick under those conditions should always be a push.
When it becomes a pull it is a sign that the stabilizer angle is too large.
If the conditions laid down in the la t paragraph are not observed it will, as already
noted, be impossible to secure stability ,"lith the stabilizer alone, and the center of gravity
will have to be moved forward.
It will be noticed that the curves of control force for the two airplanes in gliding are
nearly identical, while the negative momen ts about the hinge with throttle open are considerably larger for No.1 than for No.2 . This difference i at least partially due to the difference in the vertical coordinates of the center of gravity, the C. G. of No.1 being higher than
that of o. 2 becau e of the reserve tank in the upper wing. The center of gravity being
farther above the thru t line in No.1, the thrust on that machine produces a stalling moment

about the C. G. , and this has the efJ"ect of making the machine le ' nose hea\"y than it would
otherwise be.
It is de irable that the pilot of an airplane hould be able to relea e the controls at any
time without causing the IDfl.chine to go into a steep dive or to stall badly. In order to fulfill this
requirement the center of gravity hould be matorially farther forward with respect to the
wing than it wa in the particular airplane~ which were the subjects of the e te ts, and the
stabilizer should be set, at such an angle to the wings that the machine will be ill equilibrium with
the controls free and the engine tlu'ottled at a speed well within it. normal range (60 miles per
hour would be a good figuro for an airplane of the type and performance of tbo JN4II). Exact
recommendations as to tho position of the . G. can not be made without further te ts, but it is
probable that 28 pel' cent of the way back from tbe leading edge on the mean chord of the wings
will be found a satisfactory location. The negative angle of the stabilizer with respect 1.0 the
wings should be larger in these .lnachine' tban intho e in which the stabilizer ection is symmetrical about a horizontal plane. A stabilizer with a flat lowor aud a camberod upper surface,
su ch as that ont he J 4H, has it zero lift line at an angle of from 2° to 4° to its chord, and it is
the zero lift line which should be considered in choosing the etting.
In order to pu t to the te t these thoories as to the cause and cme of instability and pOOl' balance, airplane No . 1 wa rerigged with the stagger reduced by :3 inches, and with the rear of the
tabilizer blocked up so that it chord was at a negative angle of 1°. 6 to the top longerons, 01'
4° to the wing~. The reduction of the stagger by moving the upper wing backward has pract ically the ame effect a has moving the center of gravity forward.
Altbough the tests wij,h this new alTangementhave not as yet been cunied far enough to make
it pos ible to plot a set of curve, it wa very apparent that the nose heaviness of j,h e machine was
much diminished and that the tability, bo th with free and fixed controls, was improved. The
machine wa still unstable at high speed, but much 1 s 0 than before. It wa dived to a speed
of 115 miles per hour with the throttlo half closed, and Lhe pull on t,he stick at, thi 'peed was
only 10 pounds. There was no difficulty in taking orr 01' landing, and tho performance of the
machine wa not modified in any othor respect. It is believed, as are uIt of the e te ts, that it
will be found po sible by further change of the arne nature to secure complete statical stability
of the J 4H at all peeds without incurring any counterbalancing di advantage. .
Longitudinal balance of the De Haviland.

In order to have data on another airplane for purpose of comparison, and al 0 to 'ecure definite information on the eil'ect of an adju table stabilizer, the experiment which have been decribed abovt' were repeated on the Do Haviland 4 with Liberty engine. The method pur ued in
the fu'st series of tests on this machine wa identical with that alroady de cribed, and the curv
of control position, force , and moment for vil.rious throttle setting are given in figure 30 and 31.
The force required at the top of the tick to balance the weight of the elevator wa 34 pound ,
and a force of 1 pound on the stick corre ponded to a moment of 24.6 pound-incha about the
elevat.or binge. The "gearing " of the control wa therefore practically identical with that in
the J J. The scale of ab ci sm may no t be strictly accurate, a the air-speed motel' on this macnine wa never calibrated on the speed co lU'Se , bu t it prohably would not be in error by more
than three or four mile an bour at any point.
It appear from these curves tbat the DH4 posse e statical longitudinal stability both with
fixed controls and with freo controls, and that the trimming peod for any given condition increases a the engine speed decrease . If, for example, the elevator i locked at +3° with the
thro ttle open the machine will fly at 2 mile per hour, and will automatically retum to that speed
if any disturbance causes a momentarv deviation from it. If the engine i then throttled down
to the idling condition, leaving the control till locked at + 3°, the no e will drop and the teepne s
of the flight path will increase until the peed of 11 4 mile~ per hour is attained. The airplane
will then continue to de cend steadily at this speed on a flight path of constant lope. Tbere
will be no tendency, as in the otber airplanes which have been discu ed, to dive more and
more steeply without limit.

Much the same statements can be applied to flight with free controls, except that in this
case there is only one trimming speed for a given stabilizer anglc and throttle setting. Here,
again, the trimming speed increases as the thro ttle is closed.

from model tests and from theoretical considerations, some of which were developed in the
preceding section of this report.
The trimming speed increases as the stabilizer angle increases, slowly at first and then
very rapidly. A change of angle from -1 ° 30' to 0° only raises the trimming speed with free
controls from 71 to 86 miles per hour, but only about 0° 40' further change in angle is required
to increase the trimming speed from 86 to 120 miles per hour. Since so small a change of
angle has so large an effect it is necessary, in order to gain the full benefit of an adjustable stabilizer, that the adjus tment be through a screw or other slow-motion device with a minimum
of backlash, so that the angle can be regulated with great exactness. The backlash on the
DH4 t ested was about 0° 15'.

FIGURE 32.

The provision of an adjustable stabilizer on the DH4, and the range of angles chosen for
the adjustment, were largely due to the distance between the center of gravity and the observer's cockpit and the gasoline tank, a small change of weight in the rear cockpit having a
large effect on the balance of the machine. For the conditions existing when these tests were
carried out C170-pound observer, no heavy instruments, guns, photographic apparatus, or other
equipment in the rear cockpit, and gas tank two-thirds full ) the maximum positive adjustment of the stabilizer would never be required.
