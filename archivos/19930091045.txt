THE GYROSCOPIC PARTI.CLE.
By A. F .

INTRODUCTION.

The usual gyroscopic formul~ apply only to a body having kinetic
symmetry about its axis of rotation, and hence offering a steady
resista.nce to steady precession or nutation. To treat the case of
unsteady gyroscopIC resistance, we may :find in turn the periodic
stress in any precessing particle, or regular plane group of particles;
then in any three-dimensional rigid body, whether or not possessing
kinetic symmetry.
Particle in a rigid precessing body.-To find the rhythmic stresses
in n. particle of a rigid gyroscope, first assume this steadily rotating
and precessing without transln.tion, and let w, fl, be the angular
speeds of rotation and precession. Also assume the centroid at the
origin of x, y, Z , as in fig. 1; and let the reference axes X, Y, Z, be
respectively the rotation axis, the nutation axis, theprecession axis;
n.nd cn.U by like names the reference planes normal to these axes.
Then any pn.rticle distant y from the nutation plane has, parn.llel
to the rotation axis, the linear speed - yQ= -rDcosa, and the linear
n.ccelera.tion rwDsina = z:uD, r being the distance of the pn.rticle from
the rotation axis, and zits linen.r, a its angular distance from the
precession pln.ne.l
About the axes of precession and nutn.tion, therefore, the moments
of 2n. particle of mass m n.re - myzwD, mz2wD, and h ave the r esultant
mr wrlsina n.bout an n.xis perpendicular to r n.nd the n.xis of rotation.
For a group of three or four particles symmetrically spn.ced about
the axis of rotation, the resultn.nt gyroscopio moment is easily seen,
from this expression, to be constant. In general, the gyroscopic
torque is constn.nt for any particle group having kineti-o symmetry
about the rotation axis, or whose fundamental 2 ellipsoid is a surface
of revolution about that axis. For such symmetry J:-myz = zero, and
- the constant value of the torque is 2:m~;2wD= fwD, where f = 2:mz2 •
If, now, motion of translation be added to the above specified
conditions it will not alter the values found for the gyroscopic moments, as may be inferred from the principle of the independence of
Those nrc (amiliar equations in elomentary mechanics.

the motions of transbtion and rotation. Also, as is well known,
neither linear nor angular acceleration produces any gyroscopic
effect.
If nutation, as well as precession, be assumed, the ensning gyro!!copic effects can be inferred from analogy to the case already treated.
nlustrations.-Figure 1 shows graphically for one revolution the
above values of the linear velocity and acceleration of a particle in
a gyroscope. The graphs, drawn upon a cylinder are both sine
curves but with a phase difference of one quadrant; that is, the accelern.tion of the particle is lVeatcst when its speed alon~ the cylinder
is least, and Vice versa. .dence, referring to the X direction only,
it appears that every particle of a precessing gyroscore performs
simple harmonic motion across its instantaneous plane 0 rotation .

Figure 2 shows graphically for one revolution the foregoing value
of the total gyroscopic moment of a particle, as also its rectangular
components.
Figure 3 shows graphically, for several groups of particles S'ymmetncally placed about the axis of rotation, both the component
moments of each particle about the axes of precession and nutation,
and the added particle moments for each group. The curves illustrate, what was seen analytically, that the component gyroscopic
moments of each individual particle of the group are represented by
sine square curves for the nutation axis, sine-cosine CJIves for the
precession axis; whereas the summation of the moments ahout these
axes, of all the particles, is zero or constant for each group of particles except the binary one, for which the summation is variable
about both axes. The two-particle group, or a uniform material
line joining the particles shown, has the resultant moment "1;mrwQsina,
whose extreme values are zero and IwQ, I being the moment of inertia
of the material aggregate about its center, i. e., 1= "'Zmr.

Application to propelZers.- From the foregoing analysis it appears,
using the same notation, that rigid and steadily precessing onedimensional 1 propellers, and approximately also propellers with
straigbt narrow blades, are subject to tho following laws :
1. ~very blade is uro-ed to simple harmonic motion, of the same
period as that of the shaft, across the instantaneous plane of rotation, and hence sustains a reversal of gyroscopic stress twice each
revolution .
2. Every blade sustains a fluctu ating gyroscopic moment whose
ma~nitude at the hub is '1:.m1.2 w Qsina, which at quadrant intervals in
eacn revolution has the successive vttlues IwQ, zero, I wQ, zero.
3. The aggreg te gyr oscopic moment transmitted to the shaft by
a two-blade propeller is variable and at all instants equal to twice
that of one blade.
4. The aggregate gyroscopic moment transmitted to the shaft by
a steady running multiblade propeller is constant and at every instant
equals the geometric sum of the varying moments of the individual
blades. For example, calling the maXImum gyroscopic torque of
one blade of a propeller unity, the constant torque of a three-blade
screw is 1.5 ; of It four-blade screw 2.0; of an n-blacle screw n/2.
Particle in an elastic precessing body.-All ordinary gyroscopes are
practically rigid and in their ultimate parts are subJcct to the gyroscopic effects heretofore delineated. But propellers, more especially
nonmetal ones, POSSP..8S considerable flexibility. Their blades consequently yield t o the gyroscopic force so as t o shift the cardinal
pomts of acceleration and velocity shown in figure 1. Also the
vibr ations of flexible blades are cumulative under the pulsating
stresses, until the damping factors-air pressure and internal viscosity-of the blade limit its rhythmic excursions . The damping
due to internal viscosity is sometimes great enough to raise the
temperature of the propeller considerably, especially at or near tho
hub. No method of analysis is available to give an accurate estimate
of the straining effects in elastic blades. But it is well enough known
how fatigue induced by rapidly fluctuating and especially rapidly
alternatincr 2 stresses shortens the life of the material.
It can be shown by elementary mechanics that the period of
vibration of each par ticle of a rotating propeller blade, due to centrifu&al force alone, is equal to the period of rotation, whatever the
radial distance. S This property favors cumulative vibrations when
the disturbing forces have the same period as the propeller. The
o-yroscopic force in a blade has been shown to have such a period.
~he varying air pressure on the blade has also that period in many
instances; for example, when the air flow toward the screw is oblique
to the axis, or when the air speed of approach is greater at one pa.rt
of a blade r evolution than another. For this reason propener blades
are sometimes designed to have under fiber stress alone a free
vibrational frequency about 50 per cent greater than the frequency
of rotation.
1 A onc-dimensional propeller may be dofined as n propeller composed of infinitely narrow blades symmetrically mdiating from a point on tho axis of rotation. The blades will hero be assumed straight.
, Sinco tho gyroscopic stresses alternate, tho blade stresses also may alternato when tho air forco slackens
as at low throttle .
• Sinco tho radiJll 6CCCleration of any particle is rw', the consequen t frequency of vibration is-

TIlE GYROSCOPIC THREE-DIMENSIONAL BODY.

Theory of the equivalent mass.-From the gyroscopic theory of a
particle follows that of a body. In analyzing the motIOn of any given
rigid body it is always possible, and sometimes more convement, to
cm ploy in place of the actual body a kinetic equivalent; that is, a
m ss distribution which would, under the given system of forces,
have the same translation and rotation as the actual body. For
cxample, suppose the given body to be specified by mass .ill and
princlpal moments of inertia A, B, 0, at the centroid and choose for
equivalent body the point-mass distribution shown in figure 4, and
defined by the followmg equations in whicn a, b, c, are distances from
the origin of the equal point-masses M/6 .

Then, since the right members are given, the massless arms a, b, c,

To show that a, b, c, are always real, note from equation (1) that

In the most general case of rotation about three axes, each particle
of the six-point equiValent mass exerts a gyroscopic torque whose
magnitude and direction may be found by the method employed
for n. single gyrosoopic particle. The component torques so found
cnn be compounded in the usual way to obtain the resultant torque.

A six-point equivalent mass has been Hsed here as a convenience;
other distributions comprising fewer or more particles may obviously
be employed.
Examplcs .-As illustrll.tion, suppose the model to represent a
gyroscope rotatinO' steadily about two axes only, say X and Z, its
centroid being eit'her stationary or in motion . Then the mnsscs :1t
a, a, taken together obviously exert no resultant moment, for they
have no gyroscopic acceleration, and any acceleration they may have
from their translatory motion is, in magnitude and direction, the same
for both. From this it follows that such a rigid body has the same
gyroscopic torque whethe its mass be all in the plu.ne of robtion
Y Z or not-that is, whether a be zero or of any finite magnitude.
Hence the gyroscopic torques nbout Y and Z, of any rigid solid rotating about X and Z may he derived from the treatment of a point mass
distribution in the Y Z plane, say, four equal particles spaced as
shown in figure 1, at h, h, c, c.
It has been proved above that a single particlo of a gyroscope in
steady rotation and precession has about the nutation axis a torque
~roportional to the sme squnre of its angubr distance from that axis.
Four equal particles symmetrica.lly placed about the rotation axis
have, therefore, about the nut tion axis a resultant torque which is
constant and equal to twice the maximum torque of one particle.
Hence any mass having kineLic symmetry about the rotation axis,
since it is the gyroscopic equivalent of a four-particle mass, has a
constant torque equal to twice the maximum of one such particle.
This generalization can, of course, be derived algebraically from the
above-mentioned sine square hw.
Summa1y-The foregoing treatment of the mass equivalent of a
rigid body may be summ:-mzod as follows:
Every rigid body has a mass equivalent whose motion under given
forces is the same as that of the body itself. In particular, any rigid
body has as mass equivalent six equal particles suitably placed on its
principal centroidal axes and invariably connected by massless bonds.
A sIX-particle mass equivalent reduces to foUT particles for a plane
distribution; two for a rectilinear. The arms of the six-particle mass
equivalent of any rigid body equal, respectively, its radii of inertia
referred to the reference planes, multiplied by v'3.
The gyroscopic torque about its centroid of any rio'id body is
unaffected by its linear or angular acceleration or by the fuear speed
of its centroid.
At any instant the gyroscopic torque of a rigid body is the resultant
of the torql.).es of its equivalent mass particles .1
Application to an air screw.-Figure 4 shows the equivalent mass,
derived from e)...-perimental data, for a standard Curtiss two-blade
propeller, whose blades are notably deep and broad. From this
:figure we can judge the comparative gyroscopic value of the distribution of the propeller mass in each of the three axial directions, since
this value varies as the square of the arm lengths, a, h, c, and as the
products in pairs of the an~ul:1r velocities, wz , W lI , w., about those
arms. In fact the ratios of the three maximum gyroscopic torques of
the pairs of point masses are as c2wz w z : h2W:z;W,, : a 2w lIUJ z ' In practice
the angular velocities m:1y have the values 150, 0.5, 0.5 radians per
I As is well known, tho glroscopiC torquo of any particlo equals its angular momentum times its d&vlstion, or tho rate of angular ch:mge of Its pl:mo of rotation.
