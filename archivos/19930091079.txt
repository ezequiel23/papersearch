INTI?ODUCI!ION.

It is well known that the recent remarkable advanom in the design of highpeed intarnalcombustion augines have been made almost entirely by cut and try methods. Iimr-ed
vaIve areas, inoreased compression ratios, better intake manifold design, better oarburetion,
eto., have enabkd us to attain mean efleotive pressures that a few years ago ware not dreamed
of. Yet there is at prment no accepted way of de&mining theoretically the rehtion between
valve are=, stroke volume, speed, and volumetric etEoiency. The question of the proper
reIative areas of inlet and exhaust valves is still moot. There is no way of fixing the proper
valve timing for any given case, except the way of ~mimeut,
and thare is little information
available regarding the effeot of improper valve settings on the vdumetrio eflioienoies and
pumping 10SSM. h short, the designer dispene= almost entirely with theory.
This condition of affairs is obvioudy due to the multiplicity of the factcm whioh affeot the
performance of internal-combustion engine9. The large number of such factors not only makes
theorizing extremely difiicult, but it makes it exoewhgly hard to interpret test rmults with
any degree of certainty, so that we have little that is reIiable in the way of data for oheoking
up a theory once formulated. The increasing number of well-equipped experimental laboratmk, however, is sure to yield plenty of new and reliable axperimeutal data, and just on &is
aooount it beoomes important to develop a theory which shall guide the experimenter and at
the same time aid in the interpretation of his remdta.
It is hoped that the method of camputing low prwo.re indioatar oards outlined in this report
will prove to be the first step in the development of suoh a theory. The writer particuhmly
desires to emphasize the fact that this work is only a beginning, whioh can not at present be
expeoted h yield remdte which are quantitatively rebabh
The method of calculation here outlined is bwed on the following assumptions:
(A) The mixture of air, burnt gas, and fuel in the cylinder maybe treatd as a perfeot gas.
(B) The kinetic energy developed by the inooming ohsrge se it passes through the throat of
the inlet valve is converted into heat by eddies as fast as it emerges from the valve, so that we
may treat the gas in the cylinder es if it had a dehite temperature and pressure.
(C) The heat transmission between the gas and cylinder rolls tigether with the heat
absorption due ta the vaporization of the fuel have a negligible ellect on the pressure variations;
that is, the processes under consideration may all be treated as adiabatic.
(D) The rate of air flow through the intake and exhaust vdv= may be calculated from the
manifold pressures, the cylinder pressure, and the valve clear openings by the ordinary formulas
for steady flow through au ofice with the aid of determinable cdicients
of efhx.
These hypotheses are aU to be regarded es rough approximations to the truth. The writer
is of the opinion that the phenomena ignored through the introduction of these assumptions are
of secondary importmce in determining the preamre variations in the cylinder during the suction
and exhaust strokes. In the last analysis, however, the just.i6cation of this opinion must come
through a comparison of the results obtained from this theory with the results of experiment.
Assumptions B and D me apparently indispensable to the present method of attack on the
probl~.
A and C, on the other hand, constitute convenient simplifications suitable to the
prwent preliminary analysis, but not necwmrily =entiel to the method. h emneotion with

hypothesis C it should be observed that even though the charge in the cyLinder absorb a good
deal more heat from the walls during the suction stroke than is required to complete the
vaporization of the fuel, the increase in the heat content of the charge wilI not be accompanied
by a correspondingly larger fired pressure. This is because a slight increase in pressure due to a
rise in temperature immediately reduces the rate of flow through the inlet valves.
In order to apply the method it is necessary that pressuree in the intake and exhaust
manifolds at points adjacent ta the valve and the effective clew valve openings shall be lmown
functions of the time. By the effective clear opening of a velve is meant the product of the
minimum sectiomd area of the passsge through the valve and the coefhient of efhx.
The use of the method is obviously reetrictid by the above reqniremente, since the manifold
pressures me usually not lmown. In the case of a motor exhausting directly to atmosphere,
however, the manifold pressure becomes the barometric prassure. Furthermore, certain types
of multicytinder inlet manifolds have a nearly constant prcwwe, while a motor which draws
air duectly from the atmosphere and has its fuel injected directly into the cylinder will have
atmospheric intake pressure, so that in these special cases the method is obviously applicable.
In general the fluctuations in the manifold pressure maybe expected ta be small compmed with
those in the cylinder, and it is believed that the rwult of applying the method by replacing the
actual varying pressure by its average vedue mill be imtructive, though quantitatively in error.
The coetlicient of etllnx may be qected
to depend On the shape of the valve and port,
the direction of flow, the ratio of the valve velocity to the wJocity of the air through the valve,
and the product of valocity of approach and the rata of valve closure. The codicients for
steady flow may be obtained from such experiments as those desmibed in Report No. 24, Air
Flow Through Poppet Valves, by Lewis and ITutting. The coefficients applicable in cssw of
intermittent flow might be obtained from a study of experi.mentd light spring diagrams with
the aid of the theory developed below. The writer is inclined from a priori considarationa to
the opinion that the coeflicienta for steady flow ahonld not dif% wmy greatiy from those applicable to the intermittent flow obtied
in practice provided that the pressures used in making
the calculations are those actually *ting
at points close to tie wJvee. (The pressures m

by C. E. Lucke, Trans. A. S. hf. E., VOL27, 1905), and it is desirable that fnrtlmr experiments
be made to determine the actual values of the coefhcienta of EJHUX cases of rapidly varying
in
flow. It should be pointed out in this cm.nection that the errors involved in using the steady
flow ccdkients maybe expected to inmease with the ratio of the valve velocity tn the veloci~
of the air through the vakre and with product of the velocity of approach and the rate of valve
closure.

In modern high speed interred combustion engines the pressure inside the oylinder wiU
generally be greater than the prawure in the inlet passage when the inIet valve begins to open.
Consequently we have to deal with outflow as well as inflow through the inlet passages. On
the othar hand the flow through the exhaust passages is always in the one direction. If the
periods of valve opening overlap, the outward flow may ooeur simultaneously through both
valves. This case can be deelt with by the addition to the righ~hand member of (18) of a
term h take care of the outward flow thro~h the inlet vahe.

GRAPHICAL

INTEGRATION.

The above equations (17), (18), md (23) are of suoh a form that it is useless to athnpt au
analytical integration. They are of the general first order type.
(25)
An aeourate method for the graphical integration of this type of equation is given in Runge’s
“Graphical Methods.” For our purpose, howevar, it will do to use a simpler means of getting
an approximate solution.
The cquatiom (25) deibs not one curve, but a whole family of ourves, one of whioh passes
through every point in the region of definition off (z, g). ~ (z, y) is the slope at the point z, y
of the particular curve whioh passes through x, y. We deiine the combination of the point
z, y with a short straight line through that point having the slope~ (z, y) as a lineal element of
di&rentiaI equation (26). ~ (z, y) being continuous, the directions of these lineaI elements
vary continuously from point to pornt. Hence by plotting a hrge number of lineaI elements
we can cdimati the direotion of the integral curve passing through any ohosen point (see plot
4). It happens that we are interested only in the particndarintegral ourve passing through the
point loge P., to. Consequently labor is saved if we prooeed as foIIows: First plot the lineal
ekummt through log. PO, % Choose a slightiy larger value of t, say ~, and by a prolongation
of the above lineal elament to the line z =~, get an approximate value of the ordinate corresponding to this absoissa. P1ot the lineal elemgnt through this new point and through two other

from ita initial point on the line z = & to its intersection with thelinez=~, and to get au approximate vahm of the ordinate of its intersection with another suitably chosen vertical line, say
z=~.
By s simple repetition of this process we mm extend the integral curve to any desired
value oft with a minimum of labor.
When the relation betweau the pressure m the cylinder and the time haa been determined
the mass of fresh charge drawn into the cylinder during the suction stroke can easily be ctilcu.
lated by means of a second simple mechanical integration. We denote this charge by the
symbol ~. It ia equal to the gross oharge flowing into the oylinder through the idet valv~
equ&minus the mass which fiows out through tbe valves during the initkd period of p~e
zation. Let t’ denote the time at which the inlet valve begins to open. Let t“ denote the tie

These integrals can be evaluated by mems of a planimeter.
One of the equations (17) or (18) is applicable at all times when the flow through the
valves is outward, e-ran though part of the flow is through the inlet valve, although, if gas is
escaping from the cylinder into the inlet manifoLd, we must replace in (18) by (E+ FJ. It is
not to be eqected that there will ever be any inward flow through the exhaust valvm, or an
inward flow through the inlet valves when the exhaust valves are open. Thus Equations
(17), (18), and (23) cover all cases which wilI arise in practice.
INTRODUCTION OF NUMERICAL VAMJES.

Before making a definite application of the above equations, we introduce some rough
assumptions regmding the properties of the gas in the cylinder. Normal exhaust gas from ~
engine using gmline as fuel may be assumed to contain about 13.6 percent by volume of water
vapor, 12.4 per cent of COz,and 74 per cent of ~,. The percentages by weight are then 8.5 per
cent (HaO), 19.1 per cent (COJ, and 72.4 per cent (iV_Z). The specific heata at 200° l?. and at
constant pressure may be taken to be 0.448 B. T. U. per pound, 0.202 B. T. U. per pound,
and 0.244 B. T. U. per pound, respectively. The specitic heat of the mixture in mechanical
units computed from the dove rough assumptions is 198 foot-pounds per pound. The ges
constant of the mixture is 53,7 and the spefic heat at constant volume work out to be
Cr=CP–R=198–64=144
The ratio of the specific heats is
7=~4=1.376.
We take the above values of R and ~ as the basis for our tit rough calculation. At the
high temperatures prevailhg during the exhaust stroke a amalk value of T would probably
be more accurate, while it is probable that a slightIy larger mdue would be better for the suction
stroke.
Introducing these values, we find that the critical prtwure ratio is 0.5334. Further;

Equations (28), (29), and (30) enable us to detarmine the relation between preesure and

use an equation of the form (18).

EFFLUX COEFFICIENTS.

It will be assumed that efflu coefficients derived from steady flow experinmnt.a,such as
those of Lewis and Nutting (Report No. 24), are applicable to intermittent flow. As a first
approximation, the eflecta of valve dwign and seat angle, as well as the eilect of reveming
the direction of flow, wiU be neglected. In other words, it will be assumed that the tiux
coefficient of any inlet or exhamt valve is a function only of the ratio of the clear opening of

Plot 1 shows the relation between the above-mentioned ratio and the coefficient of efllux
as computed from the experiments of Lewis and Nutting on 1~inch valves. Whereas the
coefficients of efflux repo~ted by Lewis and Nutting are based on the rough assumption that
the clear opening of the valve is equal to the product of the valve lift and the portvcircumference, the values used in the curve on Plot 1 have been corrected by the substitution of clear
valve areas computed in a more accurate manner by means of trigonometrical formula

CONCLUSION.

In conclusion it should be pointed out that we have here developed a method of computing theoretical low+pring diagrams which is capable of further development and refinement

from the theory can not be relied on. His to be hoped, however, that the reaulta will prove
to be of qualitative value and that future experiments will show us how h so modify the
theory that it will give quantitatively correct values.
