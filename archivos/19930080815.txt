The diameter Do is 2.94 zI.,and the sfficie~y

at 20 = 3,000meters. The efficiency ~ will thsref re practically
o
be 1.06 X 0.75= (3.79 21 = 10,000 meters and thepropelbr should
at
have adismeter D1=l.22

x2.94

=3.58m.

With a propellerof this dimension insteadof 2.94m., the engim
when near the ground level will turn at on3y a low speed on aoooun%
of the dreg of the propeller. The power of the engine beingproportional to its sped, the take-offE@ climbwould certainlybe difficult. On the contrary,
above the normal~titmde of fl~ght the engine would race as alt~ttieinoreases.
We thus see that the ntilizabi.onof propeller,
a
determirnd
for
horizonta3

flight

at a certatial%itvde

, ma~ provoke

the fallowing

phenomena:

a) If the altitude chomn is too high, the airplane may not be
abZe to get off the grounds cm will do so with difficulty.
*O
b) If this altitude is 3owenough to enab2e the airph
get off the ground easily, the engiza will raoe at high altitudes.

With a propeller
of variable

If absolutely
