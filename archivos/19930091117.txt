INVESTIGATION OF THE MUFFLING PROBLEM FOR AIRPLANE ENGINES.
By

G.

B. UPTON and V. R.

GAGE.

The initial perception of the presence of an airplane comes commonly through hearing
rather than sight . When near a plane the noise of the unmuffled engine is fairly deafening.
If muffling can be contrived without too large a loss of power it will become much easier for
the pilot t o operate his plane, a cut-out being provided for engine-testing purposes. In civil
use of planes, if passengers are to be carried or if planes become numerous, mufHing ·will almost
surely be required, as it now is for automobiles, motor boats, and stationary engines . In
military use of the planes the advantages to be derived from silent operation, if that is possible,
are immensely greater ; for example, with night-bombing airplanes.
A preliminary report upon this subject was printed as Report No . 10 of the Second Annual
Repor t of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, 1916, pages 41 to 49; hereinafter
referred to as Report No . 10. This report outlined the problem, gave the status of muming for
automobile engines, and gave the beginnings of our experimental work. For the main part of
the experimental work, Prof. V. R. Gage has been associated with the initial staff of Profs.
H. Diederichs and G. B . Upton.
In t he early summer of 1917 the Curtiss engine was taken over by the U. S. A. S. M. A.
at Ithaca. A considerable amount of experimental data had already been accumulated.
Designs of mufflers had been worked out to be tried upon planes in field work. At this time,
however , muffling was much less important than the production of engines and planes, so that
field experiments with mufflers were not carried out.
The work has fallen into two divisions : First, the determination of the relation between
back pressure in the exhaust line and consequent pow-er loss, for various combinations of speed
and throttle positions of the engine. Second, the construction and trial of muffler designs,
covering both type and size. The main body of the work has been done on a Curtiss OX eightcylinder airplane engine, 4 by 5 inches, rated 70 horsepower at 1,200 revolutions per minute.
For estimation of the muffiing ability and suppression of "bark" of individual exhausts, we
have also used an "Ingeco" stationary, single cylinder, 5~ by 10 inch, throttling governed
gasoline engine, and occasionally other engines.
On the Curtiss engine the carburetor was a Schebler model L. The throttle control rod
was graduated and adapted for duplication of settings by means of a screw setting into holes.
Adjustment of needle valve and cams controlling the mixture was once made and was not
subsequently changed. The ignition · was by Boscb magneto with fixed spark, set in the
advanced position by the manufacturer's instructions. This adjustment was never changed.
The spark plugs gave trouble and had to be renewed. The engine was started by power from
an electric (street car) motor, belted to a pulley which was keyed on the end of the fan dynamometer shaft, on the end away from the engine. The engine was brought to a moderate speed
with the magneto short circuited and then ignition was tumed on and the belt thrown off the
fan dynamometer pulley simultaneously. Cooling water was supplied to the engine from the
water mains through the regular circulating pump . The water supply valve was always opened
to the same point, which had been found by trial to give slightly more than adequate cooling.
It was found that air locks might occur and t o detect them separate discharges lines were used,
one from each block of cylinders.

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

In the determination of power losses due to the muffiers it was desirable that the engine
should drive a dynamometer with the same torque-speed characteristics as a propeller. We
therefore built a fan dynamometer, copying in detail the dimensions of one at the
Automobile Club of America's laboratory at ew York City. This design of fan has previously
twice been calibrated using cradle dynamometers. The fan has two blades set diametrically
opposite. These blades are rectangular plates 14 by 10 inches, with the 10-inch dimension
radial. As used, the outside diameter across the blades was 42 inches, requiring 35.4 horsepower at 1,000 revolutions per minute, and for other p ow rs varying with the cube of the speed.
This adjustment holds the engine to rated load at rated speed (61.2 horsepower at 1,200 revolutions per minute, 69.1 horsepower at 1,250, 77.8 horsepower at 1,300). Dimensions and
calibration of the fan are given more completely in Appendix A.
The determination of the power consumed by the fan depends solely upon the measurement of speed. For the reading of speed we used a Hopkins electrical tachometer, with its
dynamo driven directly by the engine crankshaft through a flexible coupling. The tachometer
was calibrated several times during the progress of the work, both in place on the engine and
on a small high-speed lathe.
To determine the power loss due to back pressure, we put exhaust manifolds on the engine
along each block of four cylinders and combined the exhausts in a cross pipe at the rear of the
engine, as illustrated in figure I, a photograph of the set-up. The cross pipe ended in a tee
with two valves, one a gate valve for adjustment and the other a quick-opening valve, similar
to a "molasses" valve. The second valve was used either entirely open or entirely shut; the
change from closed to open and reverse could be made instantly. In running to determine
power loss the engine would be set at a given throttle position with the quick-opening valve
wide open; then closing that valve the gate valve was set to give a desired back pressure. Runs
were then made, alternately, in quick succession, with the quick-opening valve open and shut.
In each condition readings were taken of speed and back pressure. The alternation of conditions was repeated several times, until the drop of speed (and power losses) associated with a
certain back pressure seemed well determined.
There was one manifold for each block of four cylinders composing one leg of the vee.
The back pressures of the two groups of cylinders were read separately and independently:
The manometer connections were made in each manifold at a point about 6 inches beyond the
last cylinder and the two fittings were identical in construction. The pressure taps were made
of small brass rods riveted over inside nearly flush with the manifold, with a lock nut outside
the manifold. The openings through the rods were the same and were about -h inch in diameter. This construction was used in order to minimize as far as possible any errors of pressure
due to the effect of velocity and to damp the pulsations of pressure. If any such velocity
effects did enter into the observations of pressure they would disappear in the taking of the
pressure difference of runs with and without applied back pressure. Taking the pressure
readings so close to the engine was intentional; all manifold and piping resistance beyond these
taps will be shown in the readings, and it was a matter of interest to discover how serious these
losses might be, due to the use of long or improper exhaust piping.
From the pressure taps connection was made through rubber tubing of about U -inch inside
diameter and 6 feet long to mercury manometers. A considerable mass of mercury was used
in each manometer to obtain the damping effect of its inertia. Further damping was found
necessary and was secured by stuffing the upper ends of the manometer tubes with cotton
waste. With the engine running, the back-pressure readings were satisfactorily steady and
practically without time lag in shifting from running with and without applied back pressures.
The first series of runs was made to determine the power losses caused by different applied
back pressures with the engme under a :fixed throttle position, set for normal power and speed.
The observations taken are shown in the first four columns of Table 1. The other values shown
in Table I are the results of computations from the averages of the data.
The true speed, revolutions per minute, is obtained from the tachometer readings by the
use of calibrations made before and after groups of t ests. The correction factor for the tacho-

meter was always a constant mUltiplied into the indicated speed.

This constant was about

1.09.

The per cent power 10 s was computed from the relative speeds with and without applied,
back pressure. If the speed with applied back pressure wa 97 per cent of the original speed, the
power loss was (1.00)3 - (0.97)3 = 1.00 - 0.9127 = 8.7 per cent. This relation is true because of
the loading of the engine by the fan dynamometer. The power absorbed by the fan is proportional to the cube of the speed. (Appendix A.)
The brake M. E. P. (brake mean effective pressure) is the product of the mechanical efficiency of the engine and the mean effective pressure as shown by an indicator diagram, and is
expressed in pounds per square inch. For this engine:
Let P- brake M. E. P.

Various results from this group of tests, as shown in Table I , are shown as curves in plots
2 to 5, inclusive. In all of these curves the absci a i the applied back pre sure measured in
inches of mercury. This" applied back pre ure " is trictly the increase of manometer reading,
over that given with open discharge from exhau t manifolds and piping, with the application
of a definite constriction of discharge.
Plot 2 shows the power losses, in per cent, as a function of the applied back pressure.
With no applied back pre sure the throttle was set and locked to give about 1,23 0 r. p. m.
corresponding to about 65 horsepower output to the dynamometer. The engine did not always
come back to this speed and power when the back pressure was relieyed, because of many
minor variations of ignition, carburetion, lubrica tion, cooling, etc. These changes were cared
for by the method of testing employed, a previously described. The results as to power loss
in plot 2 will be found only for one setting of the throttle on this engine. It could not be assumed
that the same percentage power loss would be found , for a given applied back pressure, on
another engine, or even with other throttle positions on this engine. These power 10 ses are
conditioned, also, by the dynamometer characteri tic of power varying with cube of speed.
They would not hold for automobile engine operation in general, because the load characteristics would be different. This curve is, however, approximately typical, in form and in numerical value, of average :flying conditions with airplane motors, when the exhau t is choked by
any means to increase the back pressure. This curve gives the information de ired concerning the relative magnitude of the power losses incident to increasing the back pressure of an

airplane engine by attempts at muffling. If satisfactory noise suppression can be secured with
small increases of back pressure, the power loss may be tolerable.
For moderate back pressures the power loss is substantially proportional to the back
pressure. For higher back pressures the power loss mounts rapidly, apparently at such a rate
that a back pressure of even less than 10 pounds fer square inch (20 inches mercury) would
stop tho engine. These relations are perhaps better brought out in plot 3, which is the same
as plot 2 except that the coordinates are logarithmically scaled. Tho full line curve in plot
3 is the curve of plot 2 transferred. The dash line in plot 3 shows what would happen if the
power loss continued to be proportional to the back pressure.
A po sible explanation of this changing effect of back pressure as the back I ressure increases
may be found by considering the indicator card. This is schematically shown in figure 4.
For small back pressures we may expect the main effect to be a lifting of the exhaust line of
the card by an amount substantially equal to the increase of back pressure. The result would
be a loss of indicated M. E. P. equal to the back pre. 'ure, becau. e the elevation of the exhaust
line would extend through the whole stroke. The loss of braJre M. E. P. will be smaller than
the loss of indicated M. E. P. in the ratio of the mechanical efficiency of the engine to unity.
At higher back pressures the exhaust gases are held back in greater amounts in the cylinder,
leaving the clearance space, at the end of the exhaust period, filled with an adnormal weight
of hot, dead gases. These, reexpanding, interfere with the incoming charge in arious ways,
lessening the amount of the fuel mixture drawn in. The decrease of charge quantity will
result in a decrease of M. E. P. which i added to the decrease of M. E. P . due to lifting of the
pressure of the exhaust line.
Probably it is the decrease of charge which is the principal reason for the possibility of
stalling the engine by fairly completely choking the exhaust pipe and before complete closure
is reached.
To make the findings of power loss caused by a plied back pressure more general, not so
much a matter of the particular case studied, the re'ults are given as 10 s of brake M. E. P. ,
by the curve on plot 5. The previous discussion of the effect of back pressure upon the indicator
card explains the form of this curve and the relations between the test curve and the line of
equality of brake M. E. P. loss and back-pressure increase. For the smaller and reasonable
values of back pressure it is quite safe to assume that the loss of brake },f. E. P . (pounds per square
inch) does not exceed, and is nearly equal to, the applied back pressure (in pounds per square inch).
This conclusion is of considerable importance to the de igner of engines, exhaust manifolds,
and mufflers, and is probably valid for all types and services of internal-combustion engines.
Of interest to the airplane de igner is the loss of propeller speed consequent upon back
pressure in the engine exhaust. Since propeller sp<,ed is tied, in a definite relation, to propeller power, the curve of plot 6 is really another yer"ion of plot 2. This curve of plot 6 should
correspond approximately to average running conditions of airplane motors. It is about a
three-quarter throttle position curve for this engine, and full throttle would probably change
the form of the curve only at the higher back pressures.
In the second series of tests the engine was brought up to about normal speed and power.
The regulating valve at the end of the exhaust pipe was closed, allowing all the exhaust to
leak through the joints of the piping and through the walls of the flexible metallic exhaust
hose when the end outlet valve was closed. The, alue of hac!- pressure was purposely made
large, in order to give more accurate readings of bad- pressure, and to see what would happen.
Readings of speed and back pressure were then tal en with the end outlet valve alternately
open and shut, until the values seemed to check among themselyes . Then the throttle opening
was reduced, and again readings were taken. Immediately after the smallest advisable throttle
run, the normal throttle as used at first was rerroduced, and a check run was made.
Table II gives the data and the computations of the runs made on August 24 and 29 . rfhe
exhaust piping was changed between August 24 and 29 by making the pipe Joints tighter.
Plot 7 shows the relation between the brake horsepower and the actual back pressure, as
given in Table II. The back pressure increas s as some exponential function of the horsepower,

when the conditions of the exhaust passages remain unchanged. The same curves are shown
on plot 8, u ing logarithmic instead of arithmetic coordinates. The slope of these curves is
slightly less than 1.5, indicating about the 1.5 power of the engine output. An analysis of the
mufHer tests made at the University of Michigan (printed in Horseless Age, May, 1915) also
indicates that the back pressure varies with about the 1.5 power of the engine output. (An
analysis of some of the features of the University of Michigan report is given as Appendix B.)
Neglecting changes of mechanical and thermal efficiency, the weight of exhaust gases, per
unit of time, must be nearly proportional to the brake horsepower. So, for a rough approximation, the quantity of exhaust gas can be substituted for the brake horsepower, as abscissre
of the curves, plots 7 and 8. The quantity of fluid discharged thr'ough orifices is nearly proportional to the square root of the pressure difference across the orifices. By analogy it would
be expected that the slope of the curves on plot 8 should be nearly 2. A contributing feature
in the fact that they are not may possibly be explained by the common method of averaging
and reading a fluctuating pressure. Averaging in case of pulsations is quite often done by
damping. The damping of the oscillations mayor it may not give a nearly true average of
the pressure. But the instantaneous rate of flow thr'ough the orifice is proportional to the
square root of the pressure at that instant. So for a pulsating flow there should be found
the integration of the product of the average of the square roots of the pressures and the time
interval during which the pressures existed, not the product of the square root of the average
of the pressures and the total time. The latter method was used, agreeably to the common
practice under such circum tances. The flow and the pressure difference in the exhaust manifolds are widely and rapidly pulsating. The average pressure as indicated on the manometer.
may be far from the average pressure value which should be used in determining the flow
However, when measuring the exhaust back pressures in this conventional manner, the empirical
relation here shown may be quite useful-that the back pressure varies approximately as the
horsepower of the engine, raised to the 1.5 power.
Plots 9 and 10 give information very applicable to muffling of airplane engines. They
show how rapidly the back pressure rises to high values as the engine is opened out to full
power and speed. The numerical values are obtained from Table II. Plot 9 shows the result
of excessive choking of the exhaust which was purposely done in this case to bring out the
action. The two curves of plot 9 result from slightly different initial conditions. Plot 10
shows the back pressure due to exhaust piping, only, including sharp turns, some extra pipe
resistance, and fittings on our experimental set-up. This curve is of the same type and of the
same magnitude of back pressure values which would come from a good mufHer. It should
be carried in mind that with these figures the engine was driving a fan whose characteristics
correspond to an airplane propeller. The form of the curves is conditioned by this type of
loading.
In attempting to analyze the data of Table II, reducing the loss of engine torque to terms
of brake M. E. P ., the result is the "shotgun" diagram of plot 11. Interpretation of this is
highly speculative considering the small amount of data which was collected. The analysis
here attempted is much broader than the special problem which was being studied, and so no
special runs were made to get the information needed to complete this figure. Curve OB is
transposed bodily from plot 5, representing runs at fixed throttle and varying exhaust conditions.
The straight line OF on plot 11 represents, as near as possible, the average relation from the
r uns with varying throttle against fixed exhaust conditions. Since the engine was coupled to
a fan dynamometer, speed and throttle position are tied together except for the slight modifications due to back pressures, etc. The small numbers adjacent to the points in plot 11 give
the approximate r . p. m. of the engine and fan; and equal speeds nearly coincide with equal
throttle positions. The apparent scattering of the points may indicate that the points do not
belong upon one curve, but upon a family of constant throttle curves such as OC, OD and OE,
all similar to OB. The curve OB was at about thr'ee-fourths throttle of the engine.
Table III and plot 12 are put in as a demonstratioI). that the choking of the exhaust by
sharp turns, pipe fittings, etc., give the same results as choking by a muffler. On August 29,

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

after taking the data given in Table II, the exhaust piping connections were changed somewhat in order to tryout a mufHer. The wire-gauze-filled muffler, described on page 48 and
figure 4 of Report o. 10, was put on the open end of the exhaust manifold piping. Runs were
made with and without the muffler as resistance, giving the data shown in Table III, and in
plot 12. This is comparable with plot 7, the lower curve of plot 7 being reproduced as the
upper curve of plot 12. All three curves are evidently of the same type. Hence the information
obtained from Tables I and II and their analysis will be applicable to the analysis ofmujJler actions
so far as back pressures and power losses are concerned.
. In the course of the experimental work so far described some peculiar phenomena were
noted. One such was an abnormal power drop, considering the back pressure, at certain
"critical speeds. " It was found that this abnormal power loss was avoided by a very small
change of speed either way from the critical. The critical speed changed or disappeared with
change of exhaust manifold. Apparently some manifold would not show this phenomena;
probably the curved manifolds would be free from it. The supposed cause of this abnormal
power loss at a critical speed is a reflected wave of exhau t gas filling the clearance of some
cylinder just before its exhaust valve closes.
Study of this effect led to a suggested design of an exhaust manifold, and ultimately to
the design of a mufHer. If the pulses of exhaust gas, following the opening of successive exhaust
valves, could be so trapped that they would never return to their own or other cylinders by
direct motion, or by reflection, interference and abnormal power losses would be avoided, and
the muffling problem itself might be simplified. The scheme selected was rather similar to the
muffler design shown in figure 3, page 47, of Report No. 10. The exhaust of each cylinder
was to enter, tangentially, the annular space between two concentric cylinders. In this space
the exhaust gas, entering with high velocity and pressure, could spin around, dissipating its
energy both by friction and by progressive leakage through numerous small holes in the inner
cylinders. The inner cylinder, continued outward from the manifold, was to become the
exhaust pipe. A design for a manifold-muffler of this type is shown in figure 13 . The tangential
entrance effects the trapping of the exhaust pulse, preventing its direct or indirect return to
any cylinder. This is shown more in detajl in figure 14.
While a device of this character (figure 13) might be successful in normal operation of an
automobile engine, it was discarded as unsuited for airplane engine service. First, the internal
construction would burn out owing to the great heat of the exhaust gases in airplane service,
and secondly, the radiant heat from the large surface of the manifold would prohibit the
installation. The first objection may be met, and the second minimized, by the more compact
construction suggested in figure 15, which could well be built with a smaller external diameter
than the other design.
The remainder of the experimental work consisted of trials of various commercial mufflers
and of experimental muffiers de igned and built by the authors of this report. The experimental apparatus remained, in general , unchanged. The dynamometer, the tachometer, and
the arrangements for reading back pressures remained the same and were used as before. Power
losses due to the application of mufflers were found as described previously in the determination
of power losses due to applied back pressures. When the emphasis was upon the determination
of mufliing ability, and the comparison of various muffler with each other as silencers, the
determination of power loss was inferred from the back pressure reading and general engine
speed. Thi method is more accurate than the direct de termination of power loss from speed
drops, because the power losses from the mufflers finally selected were small . The drop of speed
was too small to read satisfactorily while the back pressure was still a readily measurable
quanti ty.
Usually, when working with mufflers, the Curtiss engine was set to run at its recommended
speed of 1,200 to 1,250 r. p. m., developing about 70 horsepower. A scale of throttle settings
had been made so that this, and other settings, could be duplicated. Generally one muffler was
used for the entire engine, taking the exhaust from all eight cylinders. The setup shown in
figure 1 was then modified by putting the quick-opening valve on the side outlet of the tee on

the end of the cross manifold, allowing the installation of the muffler under test, without a valve,
in the direct line of the exhaust flow. The back pressure due to the mufller could then be
determined, by taking alternate readings as before, with the quick-opening valve open and shut.
The data of Tables III, VI, and part of VII came from tbis arrangement.
In a few tests, concerning particularly the capacity of mufflers, the cross manifold was
removed. A muffler could then be placed directly on the end of the stock exhaust manifold
for one block of four cylinders. Generally a muffler was placed on each of the two manifolds.
The mufflers then had to be applied and removed by hand in order to determine the back pressure due to the muffler. Tbis procedure was used for getting the data of Table IV, using the
G. P. F. 12-inch and 28-inch mufflers, and part of Table VII.
Estimates were always made of the silencing qualities of the muffler being tested. In the
end the devices selected as most promising were put through comparative tests, where rapid
substitutions were made by hand. For tbis work it seemed desirable to make an open-air
estimation of the noise of the exhaust and the degree of silencing with the various mufflers.
To get the exhaust outdoors and pointed in the right direction the tee and valves on the end
of the cross manifold were removed. At the end of the cross manifold direct connection was
made to a 2-inch piping system consisting of a 6-foot length of pipe, a 45° ell, and a second
6-foot length of pipe. Tbis piping did not muffie the exhaust to any noticeable degree. The
back pressure due to the piping, at normal engine speed, was about 1 inch of mercury. Tbis
measurement, in itself, may be of considerable interest in the problem of the disposal of engine
exhaust on airplanes. The data of Tables VIII and IX were taken with the mufl]ers placed
outdoors in tbis manner.
Many devices and ideas for silencing were considered, and quite a few were tried out. All
devices with wbich tests were made, and wbich were found worthy, as well as a few wbich were
rejected, are included in the descriptive matter wbich follows. Of the rejected schemes, only
those are described wbich are based upon some peculiarly attractive idea, or wbich are akin
to common practice. The experimenters (the authors of tbis report) applied quite peculiar
descriptive nomenclature to some of these devices. For the sake of brevity, some system of
naming is necessary, so those designations will be perpetuated, and the derivation of the appellation briefly indicated.
G. P. F.-These mufflers are shown in figure 2 and described on page 43 of Report o.
10. Four of these were used, two each of the two sizes. All were 5 inches diameter, two were
12 inches long, the other two were 2 inches long. They were made by Geuder, Paeschke &
Frey Co. These are regular stock muffiers.
Maxim.-A Maxim silencer for Fords was purchased of a local garage. The entrance to
tbis muffler was only 1.5 inches internal diameter. The tail pipe was 12 inches long, tapering
from 1.5 inches diameter at the muffler to 1 inch diameter at the outlet. It was hardly fair to
use tbis on a 70 horsepower engine; bu t the data is of great in teres t.
Manij'old mujjle1's.-The name comes from the original idea of putting several of these
devices in line, end to end, one for each cylinder, the combination to replace the exhaust manifold. However, tbis manifolding scheme was never thoroughly tried out; the one unit of the
device was used as a muffler, with conventional installation at the end of the manifold. As
originally constructed the inner cylinder did not touch the end pl ate, so that the exhaust could
escape around the end as well as through the holes of the inner cylinder. The end path could be
blocked by a piece of asbestos board fastened to the end plate. Tbis first manifold muffler was of
the same general design as shown in figure 16 and figure 17, bu t wi th the ou tel' cylinder 6 inches
long instead of 9 inches, and containing only the 3} inch perforated inner tube.
The "Long Manifold Muffler" was made up of two outer sections of the first manifold
muffier, making an outer cylinder 12 inches long. The inner tube was not perforated and extended the full length of the muffier, its serrated end touching the far end plate. The exhaust
entered the outer cylinder near one end through the regular tangential entrance of tbis type of
muffier. The entrance of the second unit was blocked. The annular space was both spin and

expansion chamber for the exhaust gases, which escaped. into the inner tube only through its
serrated end., at the opposite en d. of the mu ller from the gas entrn.nce and exit .
Later a "New Manifold Muffler ' was buil t similar to the sections which were first made,
but 3 inches longer, and with provision or slipping an ex tra perforated inner tube of 2~ inches
diameter inside of the regular 3~ -inch inner cylinder. This last design of the manifold mumer
is shown in figure] 6, with the extra inner tub e in place, and in figure 17 a sembled and disassemblod . The manifold mufflers re dovelopments of the muffler shown in figure 3, page
47, of Report o. 10.
Wire m esh type.-Several of thiB type were built and tried out. The gener al scheme is
shown in figure 4, page 48, of the Re.port No. 10. The idea is to gradually increase the r esistance, and to break up the energy, of the exhaust by means of sections filled with fine wire
mesh. The finest mesh was used at the ou tlet, and the mesh increasing in size toward the engine.
Spiral guide vane.- This schem consisted of an expansion chamber, with spirals in the
annular outlet passage, instead of tho wire mesh . The spirals fonued, in effect, a long nozzle.
Various forms of spiral were tried : of constant pitch , or area of passage; with area of passage
growing smaller toward the ou tlet, f:>rming a sor t of converging nozzle, and with the area of
pas age increasing toward the di charge end . The general design of these is based on that of the
Maxim silencer, but there is not the I' pl'ated reversal of flow in the spirals.
lVhirl cham ber m~tJlers .- So called from their general cons truction. Figures 17, 18, 19, and 20
show the form of these mufflers. Th ' exhaust pipe is flat tened from a circular cross section at
the engine to a rectangle at the mu fHer, giving a contracted nozzle effect. This rectangular
section is fastened tangentially to the circumference of a ring of considerably larger diameter.
One cover plate for one side of the' ring is a plate dished to give stiffness. The other cover is the
outlet for the gas, and con ists of a truncat ed cone . Tho exhaust gases enter the ring tangentially,
swirling around and around inside the ring. As th ey lose velocity they gradu ally escape through
the opening between the dished cover plate and the end of the truncated cone. F our of these
mufflers were made, one each with rings 4 inches and 12 inches in diameter, two with 7-inch
diameter rings. The 4-inch and 12-in ~h diameter were made with the idea of having one of them
too small and th e other too l argo. The exh aust pipe entering the muffler was contracted from
a 2-inch diameter to a rectangle I-inch wide, except that one 7-inch ring had a nozzle ~ inch
wide. The sides of the rectangle had the same to tal perimet~r as the circumference of a 2-inch
circle. This is a constructional requ.:rement. The width, or depth, of the cylindrical ring was
limited to the length of the rectangular discharge nozzle, plus clearance necessary in manufacture. This makes the rings 4 inches deep with the I-inch nozzles, and 4} inches with the
1-inch nozzle used on one of the 7-inch whirl chambers. The cover plates were dished abou t
t inch, this being the maximum ol tainable with the local tinsmith. The design called for
1 inch. The. e plates could be applied with the convex surface in or out as indicated in figure
19. The area of the open end of .he truncated cone was the same a that of the exhaust
pipe, that is, 2 inches diameter. Tho pace between the end of the truncated cone and the cover
plate was varied from time to tinle )y the various arrangements, ome of which are indicated
in figure 19 . Shallow cones were aJ ailable as well as the deep ones. With deep cone, and
cover plate dished inward, the clear ance tru:ough which the exhaust had to escape was about
t inch. With cover plate dish ed ou tward the clearance became 1 inch. Wi th sh allow cone the
clear ance was 11 inches.
The 7-inch whirl chamber muffl l' was also tried out with a double cone assembly, one cone
pointed inward and one outward . (Diagr am of arrangement in Table VII. ) This assembly
was also tried with a "diffuser " plate b etween the two cones. One diffuser was a plate with
ab ou t 100 soattered kinch h oles pm .ched through it. Another diifuser tried with bo th 7-inch
and 12-inch whirl chambers had n o boles, or very small ones, in the 120 0 sect or first passed by
the entering gas, the next 120 0 with larger holes, and still larger holes in last 120 0 •
The Duplex whirt chamber mujjl.nr consisted of the two 7-inch rings bolted end to end, using
one of the t angential nozzles as entrance, and the other as discharge passage. The al'l'angement
required the reversal of internal whirling b efore the gas could get out. Generally one or the

other of the diffuser plates was placed between the two rings. The I-inch nozzle was used as
entrance in most cases.
Venturi .-A 2-inch pipe Venturi with %' inch throat was tried, upon the idea of an expanding nozzle to secure an adiabatic drop of pressure and temperature of the gas, also, to increase
the velocity of the gas above the velocity of sound, so as to prevent any sound waves issuing
from inside the manifold. The Venturi was used alone, and in combination with the 7-inch
whirl chamber mumer, the Venturi then aoting as a discharge pipe .

The problem of silencing the exhaust noise from an internal combustion engine is fairly
comparable with the problem of silencing a high velocity rifle, or better, a machine gun. At
the instant that an exhaust valve begins to open, the gases seeking to escape from the cylinder
have a pressure in the neighborhood of 40 pounds per square inch gauge and temperatures of the
order of 1,000° F. Where the endeavor is to get maximum power from the engine, these values
are understated. If adiabatic expansion is assumed at the time of release, the initial velocity
of the di charging gas is independent of the pressure into which the gas is escaping, because
the" critical pres ure " is greater than the pressure in the manifold or atmosphere. The initial
velocity will be the velocity of sound at the" critical" pressure and existing temperature of the
gas at this pressure. This velocity of the exhaust gas is of the order of 1,500 to 2,000 feet per
second--<lonsiderably higher than the velocity of sound through the air. The first portion of
the escaping exhaust is practically a slug of gas coming out like a projectile from a gun, with a
velocity greater than that of sound in air.
It is well recognized that the report of a high-velocity rifle consists of two sounds. One
sound wave, the "report," comes from the muzzle of the gun arising from the slap of bullet and

exhaust gas upon the air adjacent to the muzzle. The other sound, of craclring, ripping quality,
comes from the tearing of the air by a projectile moving with a velocity in excess of tho velocity
of sound. If the bullet is traveling toward the observer, this second sound is heard first. The
lugs of exhaust gas from the open exhau t s of an airplane motor are soon dissipated, and do
not travel far as projectiles. While they last, however, there is little doubt that they contribute
to the quality and amount of exhaust noise from the engine.
If the velocity of the slugs of exhaust gas at the time when they enter the air can be reduced
below the velocity of sound in air, the quality of tho exhaust sound will be much duller and the
quantity of noise much less. The most effective way of lowering the velocity of sound in a gas
is to lower its temperatme.
There are two mean of accompli hing the cooling o! the exhaust gases before they reach
the atmosphere. One is by direct cooling, as by water jacketing. The other is by designing
the exhaust passages on the idea of the nozzles of a single velocity stage steam turbine, so as
to reduce the velocity of the exhaust ga os to approach the velocity of sound in air, by efficient
expansion in the nozzles. This latter method Was suggested by Mr. F. C. Mock. (S. A. E.
Bulletin, p. 270, Vol. V, No. 3, Dec., 1913.) It was found that such design of exhaust ports
apparently increased engine power. However, tho reduction of temperature by expanding in
nozzles is limited, if no work is done by the gas. Only the edge of the crack of the noise from
the slug of gas can be removed by means of xpansion alono. If tho exhaust is made to drive
a turbine, then more heat energy will be abstracted, useful work will be done, and at the same
time the exhaust velocities will be made uniform and small.
The frequency of the exhaust from a multicylinder, high-speed engine generally is a source
of a humming sound, if in any way the air is made to vibrate with the engine frequency. The
lowest audible note to the human ear is of about 40 beats per second. The exhaust frequency
of a 12-cylinder 4-cycle engine running 1,500 r. p. m. is 150 per second. This will be a lowtoned hum. To this hum an airplane propeller also contributes harmonics which will blend
with the engine hum.
Complete muffiing, so that the engine will give neither crack, whistle, nor hum of exhaust
noises would involve the smoothing out of the flow of exhaust gases into the atmosphere to a
uniform velocity below that of sound. This is manifestly impraoticable. With a pulsating
flow it might be practicable to keep the maximum velocity of exhau t gas entering the air below
the velocity of sound in the air. The humming noise will then be heard, without tho crack or
whistle.
The greater portion of the exhaust from a oylinder must pass out in this fu'st slug of high
velocity discharge, as the average velocity of the piston on the exhau t stroke is only about 25
feet per second. This shows that the actual time required for disoharging the major portion
of the exhaust of anyone cylinder is quite short compared to the period during which tho
exhaust valve of this oylinder is open. A whole group of cylinder may be discharging into one
exhaust manifold without interferences, provided the marufold is so designed that each slug of
exhaust can freely escape down the marufold without check or refloction. If too many cylindor
exhaust into one manifold, there will be overlap of the scavenging periods, during which two or
more of the various exhaust valves may be open at the samo time. Thi overlap of the scavenging periods is a minor matter oompared to what happens when a slug of exhaust enters some
cylinder through an open exhaust valve directly or by reflection.
An exhaust manifold may r educe the crack of the oxhaust by slowing dO'wn tho initial
velocity of the slugs of gas, and by a limitod amount of cooling. The direction in which the
exhaust is pointed is a con iderable factor in the noise heard by observer, the intensity of
sound being much greater in the direction of projection. Long exhaust pipes may somewhat
inorease the muffiing effect of a marufold, by added friction and added cooling. However, the
notation on Table VII, based upon the e timates of several observors, would indicate that
muffiing effect of mallifold and long smooth exhaust pipe was very slight. Bends, and al 0
rough interior surfaces, will increase the muffiing eiIect and also the power 10 .
Any long pipe may aot as does an organ pipe, having a natural period of vibration in sound
waves. This period may happen to coincide with the frequency of the exhaust in such a way

that exhaust gas will be forced back into some cylinder just before the closing of its exhaust
valve, entailing an abnormal power loss at a critical speed. Such an effect was noted in the
experimental work, and was referred to in the di cussion of Table II.
As previou ly stated, the silencing problem would be solved if it were feasible to reduce
the velocity of exhaust gases escaping into the air to a uniform velocity, less than the velocity
of sound. Practioally, it is possible only to spread out the peak of the discharge, or the "slug"
of exhaust pulse, so that its velocity is reduced toward that of sound. Every slug of exhaust,
not only while in the exhaust system but in the period of issuing from the system, is a potential
source and exciter of sound waves. The internal vibrations of the system as excited by each
slug, combine their sound with that of the impact of the slug upon the air, and change the
quality of the sound as a whole. Great inegularities of internal form of the exhaust system
may break up the internal sound waves. The sound-producing qualities of the exhaust slug
are relatively much greater than the sound waves internal in the exhaust system.
A very obvious device for dissipating the exces ive velocity of initial flow of each exhaust
is an expansion chamber. The gas velooity entering the chamber is highly irregular; it is
assumed that the discharge velocity is much more nearly uniform; and the slapping of the
external air by successive exhaust slugs is stopped. This is nearly true if the chamber is
capacious enough. The slapping action takes place as theexhaust enters the expansion chamber,
and sound waves from this point radiate outward, some of them e caping through the tail pipe.
To complete this device as a muffier, the exit of sound waves would have to be prevented, it
being assumed that the capacity of the chamber is sufficient to prevent the slug pa sing through
as such.
If through the exhaust line ther e is placed a long eries of baffies, each baffle will drag back
a portion of a passing exhau t slug, delaying this portion with r eference to the remainder, and
thus changing the flow from intermittent to nearly uniform. Muffling might then be secured
by a sufficient amount of ba£lling alone. The co t in back pre ure and power loss would be
prohibitive, to say nothing of the weight of material necessary for the baffies and general
structure. When baming structures are used, the highly hated exhaust gases burn out the
internal structure, and carbon deposits and oxide scale choke the baffies. This burning away
of internal parts is a very serious objection to the u e of baffies in mufflers for. airplane motors.
A combination of expansion chamber and baffies Can be made into a very satisfactory
muffier. The smoothing of the pulsation of the exhau t flow is done mainly by the expansion
chamber, and with much less power loss than if it were done by baffies. The baffies permit the
expansion chamber to be made of moderate dimension, by helping the smoothing out of the
flow. Also, if properly designed, they will nearly prevent the escape of sound waves from the
expansion chamber by reflection (backward) and dispersion (scattering and interference) of
the sound waves coming from the initial slap of the slug.
In order to get the effect of a large expansion chamber without great weight and size, the
manifold muffier type (" whirl chamber") con truction wa proposed. The exhaust is brought
tangentially into an annular space between two concen tric cylinders. The slugs of exhaust gas
may continue to travel around in this space, but they can not escape from this cylinder until
their velocity is sufficiently reduced to reverse or change direction in some way. If, for example,
the gas slug whirls around the chamber 20 times (it was observed to travel around more times
than this upon a single cylinder slow-speed engine) it has had, in effect, the use of an expansion
chamber of a volume 20 times the volume of the annulus. As the gas spins, I09ing velocity,
a. continued series of small portions escape, at right angles, into the inner cylinder or discharge
passage. The gas can more readily turn at right angles than r everse itself, so that there is
little chance for a retum pulse to the cylinder. In spinning around and escaping inwards, a
subdivision of the exhaust pul e is made such that the successive small portions enter the atmosphere over a comparatively long period of time, making the velocity of the exhaust gas entering the air fairly uniform instead of highly intermittent. It is also probable that the initial
slap of exhaust entering the whirl chamber of the mufflers is less than if they abruptly entered
a large expansion chamber, because there is relatively a much smaller change of size of passage.
As contrasted with the use of baffies to smooth out the exhaust pulsations, the desired end is

accomplished in these "whirl chamber" designs (and "manifold mufflers") with relatively less
power loss through back pressure.
In the typical "whirl chamber muffiers" all metal parts had one side exposed to the air
in order to have considerable cooling effect upon the exhaust, and also to avoid the danger of
the burning away of the metal. (The succe s of this cooling is illustrated upon one of the
muffiers tested, which still has upon it a paper label only slightly charred.) In so far as any
cooling of exhaust is secured, the muffling is thereby aided.
A sufficient cooling of the gas will, in itself, silence the exhaust. Such cooling is only
possible in marine practice, where water is sprayed into the exhaust line, and is found effective.
It may be desirable to place :fins for au: cooling upon the exhaust manifolds, pipes, and mufflers
of airplanes. A radiator used to cool the exhaust gases for the purposes of silencing may sound
like a humorous suggestion, and yet it may be practical on heavy duty planes.
Before a muffler can be applied to an engine there must be a manifold of some kind to take
the exhaust gases from the engine to the muffier. This manifold is itself a source of power
loss, both through friction of flow, and through the possible intederences already mentioned,
particularly the back flow of exhausts. In the early days of internal combustion engines,
manifolds were fU'st made by bringing the pipes from the individual cylinders squarely into a
collecting pipe. The right ana-led turns of this design caused high back pressure and promoted
interferences. To decrease the back pressures (and interferences) the manifolds are now made
with sweeping curves on the discharge. pipes of each cylinder, making each individual pipe
have an easy entrance, in the direction of flow, into the common pipe. It is suggested that a
more compact design could be made by analogy with the "whirl chamber mufflers." The
individual exhaust pipes might be brought straight out from the cylinders, but with their
center lines so far above or below the center line of the common pipe that the exhausts would
make tangential entrance to the common pipe. This idea is shown in the designs of figures
13, 14, and 15. The change of direction of flow from the individual pipes to the common
pipe can probably be made with back pressures no larger than from the sweeping bends of the
conventional construction, and with the advantage of compactness. The smallness of back
pressures may be inferred from the data at the bottom of Table VI on the resistances of rings
with nozzles only.
Throughout all the design of manifolds and mufflers there is one item that must be kept
continually in mind. The sharp pulse of each exhaust is practically a mechanical slap or blow
upon all of the inside surfaces of the metal parts. If these metal parts are made of thin material,
as they m ust be to save weight, it is necessary to so form them that they are inherently stiff,
incapable of buckling or drumming. Otherwise they will become transmitters for the exhaust
sound to the adjacent air, with additional noises from the reverberation of the metal itself.
Flat surfaces are to be avoided, and doubly or singly curved surfaces chosen.
The preceding paragraphs have outlined the theory of muffiing and associated problems
as it developed to the authors during and after their experiJnental work.
Early in the work there arose the question of how the capacity rating of a muffler should
be made. The data of Table IV precipitated this question. The two different sized mufflers
compared were presumably alike in internal design save that the longer ones contained a greater
number of the baffling elements in series. The G. P . F. design is given in figure 2 of Report
No. 10. According to the makers the horse10wer capacity to be handled by the 28-inch
muffiers is four times that of the 12 inch . They recommended the 12-inch mufflers for
engines up to 553 cubic inches displacement, and the 28-inch muffiers for engines up to
138 cubic inches. Yet it was found that on the Curtiss engine, with one muffler handling
4 cylinders, of 251 cubic inches displacement, the 12-inch mumers gave 2 inches of mercury
back pressure, against 4 inches !rom the 28-inch mufflers, and if there was any choice as to
silencing ability, the smaller mufflers were the better. It was also found that the 12-inch
G. P. F. muffier failed to silence a 3H by 4 inch Chevrolet automobile motor of about 170
cubic inches displacement. This same 12-inch G. P. F. mumer gave the same back pressure
and better silencing effect when handling all 8 cylinders of the Curtiss engine (Table VIII)
502 cubic inches displacement, that it did when handling only 4 cylinders of the same engine.

INVESTIGATION OF MUFFLING PROBLEMS.

21

In Table VII the data shows that one of the" manifold mufflers " had this same peculiarity of
improving its silencing, and of not increasing its back pressUTe when the n umber of cylinders
handled was changed from 4 to 8. At the same time some "whirl chamber mufflers" increased
their back pressUTe in the ratio of 1 to It or 1 to 2 when changed from handling 4 to handling
8 cylinders. If the back preSSUTe of a muffler followed the usual laws controlling the increase
of preSSUTe with quantity passing, the doubling of number of cylinders exhausting into a muffler
should have multiplied the back preSSUTes by 4. The explanation is in part in the design of
the mufflers themselves, and in part due to the peculiarly intermittent flow of the exhaust
gases.
The silencing by the muffler comes in its operation upon the" slugs" of the exhaust gas,
the size and character of which is fixed by the individual cylinders. In so far as the frequency
of impulse (due either to multiplication of the number of cylinders or to the increase of speed)
is concerned, it appears that the more frequent the impulse, the easier it is to silence the exhaust
noi e. The power loss, or back preSSUTe, seems to depend upon the form and size of the individual impulses. Perhaps if the number of cylinders should exceed the present limit (12)
there might be sufficient overlap of instantaneous impulses to require a larger mufller. The
bulk of the exhaust comes at the first opening of the valve, so these pulses are not liable to be
superposed to any appreciable extent. The characteristics of the individual exhaust pulses
are controlled by volume of cylinder, valve timing, throttle position, ignition timing, and
mixtUTe ratio, all of these affecting the amount of gas and its preSSUTe at the time of opening
the exhaust valve. The speed of an airplane engine is tied with the throttle position because
of propeller characteristics, while an automobile engine throttle and speed are independent.
As a matter of fact, it appears that the smaller the mufflers, up to some limit, the better
the silencing. Also the laro-er the muffler, the less the back preSSUTe, geometric similarity
being assumed. (The 28-inch G. P. F. muffler is not similar to the 12 inch.) The effect of
change in back preSSUTe is slight. So that the tentative conclusion is reached that, with the
muffler design geometrically fixed, and if the size only is changed, then the smaller the muffler
the better the silencing and all around action, until the power loss exceeds the tolerated value.
It may be remarked that mufflers taking all 8 cylinders of the Curtiss engine receive about
the same frequency and magnitude of impulse as if used on one side, 4 cylinders, of back geared
motors such as the Thomas or Sturtevant.
The effect of size of muffler was noted when u ing the same mufflers on different engine .
The greater the bark of the exhaust, the better was the relative suppression by the same muffler.
The mufflers were more effective in suppressing the bark of the single cylinder farm engine
(5 ~ by 10 inch Ingeco) than on the Curti s (4 by 5 inches) .
The suggestion from the facts mentioned above is that the capacity rating of a muffler
probably should not be based upon the total displacement of the engille, so much as on the
displacement per cylinder.
In reading the discussion which follows concerning the various scheme for silencing the
exhaust which were considered in this work, it should be kept in mind that the experimenters
had formulated certain requirement and limitation for muffler in airplane service. The
manifolding and mufflers should not be a SOUTce of fire risk from radiant heat. Muffler explosions
should be made harmless, either through sufficient strength, or provision of a breaking piece.
Weight of manifolds and mufflers must not be exce sive. Any parts 0 disposed as to cause
head resistance must be made as small as possible and of "stream line" form. The power
lost due to back pressUTe must also be very small. It is desirable, but not e ",ential, that the
muffler be dUTable, especially with regard to bUTning out the interior parts. The amount of
silencing required is not great, compared to the usu al ideas of muffling devices as exemplified
on automobiles. The reason for not requiring so effective silencing is that there are many
other noises coming from a plane moving through the air.
uch noises are the hi s or whistle
of the wires, the beat or drum of the propeller, and the valve and gear noises from the engine.
It has been assumed in this report that what the experimenters and a sistants called a 50 per
cent total silencing of the exhaust noise would be sufficient and satisfactory for airplanes. If
there is more silencing than this, a muffler cut-out may be needed by the pilot to judge the

engine performance. However, it wa found that 75 per cent ilencing was easily obtained,
so this was soon adopted as a standard.
A common device on planes is a long exhau t pointed upward. 'I'his i not a muffier, but
it is somewhat effective in directing the sound away from the ground. Long pipes running
back along the fuselage take the exhaust gas and orne of the noi e away from the occupants of
the plane. If pipes of smooth interior are used, the power 10 s due to back pressme is relatively
mall. In Table VIII it is noted that 12 feet of 2-inch pipe with one 45° elbow cau ed a back
pre sure of 1 inch of m ercmy on a Curti s (8-cylinder OX) engine, resulting in a power loss of
about seven-tenth of 1 per cent. It is regretted that data on the back pressure due to flexible
metallic exhaust ho e was lost, but the notation made was that 4 feet of the 2-inch flexible hose
gave more back pre sme than the 12 feet of standard 2-inch wrought-iron pipe including one
45° elbow.
The first muffler tried out in this series of te t was a wire me h muffler shown in figme 4 of
Report No. 10. The muffler type i that of expansion chamber plu baffles, relying largely upon
the baffle for noise uppre sion. The power 10 s wa slight and the muffling estimated about
50 per cent. The weight is 15 pounds, which i comparatively great. The fiat metal ides
probably drummed, reducing the muflling ability . It was anticipated that the wire gauze would
bmn out and choke the passages with scale under continuous operation. Even in short operation the 'wire gauze began to pack although it did not burn. These prospective trouble, together
with the weight, caused the discarding of this type.
The variable pitch piral muffler mentioned in Table V, wa ,a constructed, cumbersome.
Its silencing was estimated at 50 per cent plus. The construction embodied a cylindrical
expansion chamber plu a baffle placed in a concentric annular space. The baffie was made of a
single strip , helically wound around the chamber, making, in effect, a long unobstructed path.
This device is of the same type as a number of commercial mufflers which have aheady been
more highly developed. It is ubject to the disadvantage of weight, size, and bmning out.
A Ventmi with till'oat 0.75 inch diameter and of 2-inch entrance and exit was tried on the
end of the 2-inch exhaust pipe. The till'oat ize was selected to give a ga velocity greater than
the velocity of sound, in order to prevent the transmi sion of sound from the engine through the
exhaust pipe. The success was undoubted, as there was no crack. But the velocity of the gas
in the throat set up an unearthly noise all its own. The expanding portion of the Ventmi,
instead of erving a a diverging nozzle, acted as a megaphone. Then the Ventmi was tried
with the exhaust first passing through the 7-inch "whirl chamber" mumer, with somewhat
similar resul ts. The Ventmi was also rejected.
The Ford Maxim muffler was found to be a very effective silencer when used upon the
Curtiss engine, as well as when u ed on a Ford automobile. On the mtiss engine, handling all
8 cylinders, the power loss was rather high ompared with ome other device . Considering the
fact that the muffler wa built for a smail engine (the tail pipe 'Wa 1 inch diameter), this is
hardly to be wondered at. The weight of 12 pounds was prohibitive.
Throughout the experimental work the G. P. F. 12-inch muffler was used as an arbitrary
standard of muffling qualities. It appear rep eatedly in the tables on account of this. While
e timates of noise suppre~ ion were atte pted in absolute values, the final deci ion always rested
upon relative performance. The" R emarks" of Tables III and IX will illustrate this. The
G. P. F. 12-inch muffler construction, as hown in figme 2 of Report No. 10, is novel. The
baffles, in the form of nozzles, occupy the expansion chamber. The parts are few and simple.
Smfaces are doubly cmved, making for inherent stiffne s. The peculiar fact was noted that
this muffler worked equally well with either end as entrance, both a to back pressme and
silencing. There is a possibility that the internal parts may act as di persers of the sound waves
by reflection, as well a other ways.
Om attempts to design mufflers, especially adapted to airplane u e, have followed two
main lines. The " manifold " series of designs use tangential entrance to an annular whirl
chamber, the gases gradually escaping to the central part as they pin. The spin chamber
gives the effect of the conventional expansion chamber with a much smaller volume. The
perforated inner tube replaces the baffles, with less weight and back pressme. The objection

INVESTIGATION OF MUFFLING PROBLEMS.

23

to the construction is that the inner cylinder may burn out. To avoid this objection the" whirl
chamber" series was designed. The action is essentially the same as the "manifold" type, but
all metal parts are air cooled on one side, and the weight is less. A particular study of the
"whirl chamber" type is given in Tables VI and VII. While making the observations on bark
suppression, using the Ingeco engine (Table VI), the tests were made with load, at about 100
explosions a minute, and with retarded spark to give a vicious bark. The exhaust was flaming
as it issued from the engine, and gave visual demonstration of the spinning action in the whirl
chamber, and of the gradual emission of gas from the muffler.
Both "manifold" and "whirl chamber" types have a peculiarity that may be advantageous. The exhau t is turned at right angles between the entrance and discharge of the muffler, and with very little back pressure. Roughly, the back pressure is less than when using
an ordinary pipe-fitting elbow. Short tail pipes of diameter equal to the manifolds were tried
upon these types of muffiers, and were found not to affect either silencing or back pressure.
So these muffiers might be placed at the end of a horizontal manifold, and the muffier tail pipe
be carried vertically upward.
The data from the different tables in this report should not be indiscriminately compared.
The manifolding conditions Were frequently changed. I n Tables VIII and IX the manifolding
arrangements were the same, apparently, but actually were not constant. The increasing
vibration of the engine continually shook loose the packing of the joints of the complicated
exhaust line. Leaking of the exhaust from the manifolds became noticeable and evidently
serious. Part of the piping was made of flexible metallic hose, from which the asbestos packing
departed. These troubles make it improper to compare the data of Tables VIII and IX
directly with the other tables, especially in regard to back pres ure. However, the small group
of tests, marked off by themselves in the e table, are correct for relative internal comparisons.
To show how these increasing leaks affected back pressure results, the diagrammatic Table X is
given. With the aid of this diagram, applied to the data given in the previous tables, the summing of results as given in Table XI is derived . Power losses are here inferred from the curve
established in plot 2.
It is evident from this table that the" manifold" type of muffier will give good silencing
with power losses less than 1 per cent and with weights comparing very favorably with any
commercial muffler. If minimum weights are desired, the "whirl chamber" type looks most
promising although its silencing action i not as good as the manifold type.
In the" manifold" mumer type the size, hape, location, and total area of the holes in the
inner tube may be varied over a considerable extent. We used a total area of all holes equal
about one-half the area of the exhaust pipe with very good results, and deviations did not alter
the action of the muffier to any great extent, although many small holes probably gave better
muffling without corresponding increase of back pressure. The best construction happened to
have no holes opposite the entering gas, 33 hole 7il-inch diameter which the gas first passed,
33 holes -h--inch diameter next, and 33 holes >i-inch diameter last, just under the nozzle. We
do not lay particular stress upon the ize or location, except they shall not be too big.
Taking all the results as shown in plot 10 into con ideration, we have recommended, as a
tentative de ign for the Liberty 12-cylinder engine, the design shown in figure 21. A variant of
this is given in figure 22. Both designs may possibly be improved by the addition of cooling
fins. They are supposed to be placed at the end of an exhaust manifold handling the exhaust
from either six or twelve cylinders. The length of the mumer is to be parallel to the fuselage.
There is no real attempt to stream line the back end of these mufflers for the stream of escaping
exhaust gas is supposed to perform this function. Also any suction at the back end of the
mufflers due to lack of stream lining may be worth its co t. In figure 21 is shown a design in
which air is supposed to pa s through the inner tube to some extent, aiding in cooling.
It is po sible that very effective silencing could be obtained if the exhaust manifold were
patterned after the design shown in figure 15, in combination ,'lith a muffler.
The completion of the solution of the muffling problem can only be accomplished by trials
at fitting manifolds, mufflers, and tail pipes to engines installed in airplanes and in use in actual
flight.

n .-Runs at varying throttle, back pressure conditions jized.

B:lck pressure con:litions fi '<e1, in the seuse th:\t the obstructions to the e cape of exhaust gas were unchanged through lhe series of runs
However, the back pressure chan~ed with en~ine power output due to chan~e of amount of el<heust gas.
End outlet val ve alteru9.tely open and closed, relieving or app l yin~ the back pressure.
Power outp~t varied by chan~in~ the throttle pOSition. These runs correspond to throttling an elljti.ne loaded by propeller with the exhanst
escapin~ through a gi veu m~nifold and mumer.

VIII.-Tests o/muffling qualities.

Exhaust CSl"ried outdoors by connecting to the end of cross manifold two &-foot lengths of 2-inch standard wrought-iron pipe, joined by 8
45-inch cast-iron ell. This pipe caused 1 inch of mercury back pressure, additional, on the engine, but did not silence the exhaust nOISes. Curtiss
engine. Throttle position No. S.
'1'he values of noise suppression were obtained from the collaborated estimates of a number of observers. One stationed in a direct llne with
the end 01 the exhaust pipe. Another at right angles to the line of the pipe, in the plane 01 the muller. Another at the end of the pipe changing
mumers, and perhaps others scattered around. The first two were generallY about 50 feet away from muller, but other distances were also used
when mullling qualities of two devices were nearly the same.

APPENDIX A.
FAN DYNAMOMETER DESIGN AND CALIBRATION.

Because of its .flexibility and inherent regulation, due to torque varying as square of speed,
and similarity to a propeller, the dynamometer chosen was the fan type. The general scheme
of uesign is shown in figure 23. The resistance plates PP are of Tobin bronze plate -h inch
thick . The length, a, of each plate parallel to the shaft is 14 inches. The radial width, b, of
each plate is 10 inche . The plates are fastened to the steel arm, A, which revolves edgewise,
by t wo angle irons riveted on the back of each plate, and bolted to the arm A. A series of
evenly spaced holes in each end of arm A makes it possible to clamp the plates PP at any desired
distances from the cen ter, making tho outside diameters of the plates, DOl adjustable.
Th e fan shaft is m nunted in ball bearing , which are suppor ted by a framework built up
of steel angle shapes. This frame is extended, as may be seen in the photograph, figure 1 of the
main body of this repor t, to carry a rect angular box safety housing of wire mesh screen around
th e fan .

ANNUAL REPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMI TTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.

The design is copied in detail, b th as to fa and fr mework, from a fan dynamometer at
the A. C. A. testing laboratory in New York City, hich in turn was built after the "Franklin"
dynamometer. In each case the fan dynamom eter of this design was tested out by driving

from an engine or m.otor mounted on a cradle, aDd the calibration curves so obtained were
available to us and used for our machine, as developed in the following analysis:
To check the accuracy of these calibrations e used the general formula for fan dynamometers, worked out by the White
Poppe A tomobile Co., in England, and published in
Automobile Engineer, August, 1910. T he formula is quoted in the book on Dynamometers,
by F. J. Jervis-Smith, on page 117. It is
a Z R3!VB
HP = 4.01 X 1015
in which a is the side dimension of a sq . are plato, replacing the a and b of figure 23; R =

~

0

of

figure 23; and N =1'. p. m. Dimensions were in contim.eters in getting the constant 4.01 X 10 16
above. We may generalize the formula into
abD o3 Na
HP- 8 X 4.01 X 1010
for dimensions in centimeters, or

35

INVESTIGATION OF MUFFLING PROBLEMS .

for dimensions in inches.

This reduces to
HP=3.43 X 10- 15 X abD o3 X N3.

The formula i stated by White & Poppe to be valid only if there is no interference with in or
out flow of ail' around the fan. If there is such interference, and less air is handled, the power is
decreased below that given by the formula.
Taking the formula as
we checked over the available calibrations of our dynamometer design by finding the values of
K for different settings of Do, and trying to account for variations by the expected interferences
with air flow .

The relation of the K values to Do, and of the two calibrations to each other, are shown in
plot 24. The A. C. A. or Chase calibration seem probably the better, being notably more consistent internally. This may, however, be due to smoothing out of data by Chase, by crossfairing methods. Low values of K for small values of Do are due to interference with intake
air by the shielding framework around the fan; small values of K at large values of Do are due
to interference of the floor and ends of framework with discharge air.

APPENDIX B.
TESTS OF AUTOMOBILE E GIN15 MUFFLERS AT UNIVERSITY OF MICIDGAN.
[Reported in Horseless Age, May, 1915.)

These te t were made on a stock Hudson 6-cylinder motor of 4Ys -inch bore by 5 7:4:-inch
stroke. For the purposes for which e would lik . to u e the data the method of test was unfortunate. Runs were made through the ral1ge of throttle positions and speeds without a muffler,
followed by similar sets of runs with thEl muffl l' tested_ Back pressures were read with the
mufflers. Power losses were inferred by eomparison of the runs with and without the mufflers.
As tbese ru.ns were somewhat separat ed i' time, po er changes due to changes in carburetion,
lubrication, ignition, etc., can not be sorted out fr m power changes due to the muffiers alone .
The mufflers tested were commercial de il'ns, five in n umber.
From the data we have sorted out pnrts from re ults on three of the mufflers (those found
best as silencers), tabulating and plotting their results for our own information. The data
are given in Table XV berewith. Inspection of the table, which may be ta.ken to represent
the state of the art of muffiing at th dat of 191 5, hows how well grounded was the fear that
the muffling of airplane engines wo Id be acco panied with prohibitive loss of power. One
commercial muffler lost about 18 p r ce t and n, otber 14 per cent of tbe maximum engine
power. At the same time, however , there was h op offered, in that the smallest and lightest
muffler tested gave the best silencing and also t 1e least power loss- only 3.6 per cent of the
maximum engine power. This muffler eighed ] 4 pounds for a 40-horsepower motor, or 0.35
pounds per horsepower. We have no v obtained, by contrast, excellent muffiing on a 70horsepower motor at a power loss les than 1 per cent and with a weight of 5 or 6 pounds (less
than 0.09 pounds per horsepower).

Mu:fI:l.er Y, besides giving the least back pressme and power loss, was the least in weight
and size, and the best in silencing ability.
A partial analysis of the University of Michigan data is given in plot 25, showing the losses
of brake M. E. P. as a function of back pressure at various speeds. At the right of plot 25
the cmves for the three speeds are combined. The resultant grouping is comparable with
Table II and plot 11 of the main body of this report.
ote that in plot 11 b ack pressures are
in inches of mercury and in plot 25 in pounds per square mch.) The conclusions there reached
are confirmed, at least qualitatively, from this independent source.
Plot 26 shows the back pressures due to the mufflers as a function of power output of the
engine. It is similar to plots 7 and 12 of the main report. Plot 27 presents the same data in
logarithmic plotting, just as plot 8 reproduces plot 7. The suggestion that back pressure
varies as about the 1.5 power of the output of the engine is checked.
It does not seem quite true, however, that back pressure depends, for anyone muffler and
engine, solely on power output. The back pressure (and per cent power loss) is higher when

we have pointed out that some mufflers in our own tests did not increase back pressure when
the number of cylinders exhausting into the muffler was doubled. Other muffiers did increase
