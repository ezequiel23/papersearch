RELATION

O~

RIB SPACING TO STRESS IN W PLANES.
ING
By A. F. Zabm.

PRElACE - The change of spacing between ribs in a wing
plane

~ay

entail, (1) change of air pressure, both in distribution

and amount, (2) change of fiber stress in the fabric and the ribs,
unless tbey be so altered in dimensions as to keep their stresses
constant.

The aer.odynamic effect just stated should be studied

in the wind tunnel, or still better in full-scale flight, with
pressure collectors at many points on a median section of the wing.
The stress relations to the fabric and the rib will be considered
in some detail here.

FIBER STRESS IN FABRIC AND RIB.
STRESS IN FABRIC - It can be shown--see Appendix--that
the tensile stress t per unit width in the fabric of a wing plane,
at a point where the resultant air pressure on it is p, is approximately
a being the distance between the ribs, and c the depth of bulge of
the fabric midway between ribs at the locaHty in question.

Hence

keepipg constant th.e air pressure p, and the shape of buJ.ge, or
cia, the lineal tension t varies directly as a .

If then the fab-

ric thickness be directly as a, the fiber unit stress is the
same for all practical rib spacings.

And

converse~s

if the fiber

unit stress remain constant, with varying rib distances, the
bulge shape must remain constant, assuming the initial tautness
the same in all cases.

STRESS I N RIB - By well known mechani cs , the unit stress
in a simple bearn, with either a concentrated or a unifotm load, is
of the form

WL

S - A b d2
in which W is tne load, L the len6th, b the width, d the depth.
If the wing plane and its ribs remain geometrically similar, b
and L increase directly as d, and Was d2 , since Wvaries as the
area.

The stress therefore takes the form
S - K

d .d

~

const.

CONCLUSION - Considering therefore the wing plane simply as a static structure, and ignoring the

~uestion

of aerody-

narnic efficiency, it appears that the unit stress in the rib and
fabric wi).l remain constant for constant p if the linear dimensions
of both rib and fabric be increased alike, viz., if wing and fabric remain geometrically similar.

Since the bulge as we ll as

the structural dimensions remains geometrically similar, the
whole distend.ed plane remains so, and hence should have the same
pressure distribution and efficiency.

If therefore the Burgess

rule of making the rib spacing always one-fifth of the chord of
the plane be valid for

~~

one plane, it must be valid for all

others that are mechanically similar in structure and covering.
STRESS STRAIN RELATIONS IN W NG PLANE FABRIC.

To determine whether a given fabriC is suitable for a
given rib spacing a stress-strain diagram is made for samples of
the fabric.

-- If p, a, c, denote, as before,

the unit resultant air pressure, rib spacing, and depth of bulge;
and if r be the radius of curvature of the bulging fabric, assumed to be cir cular, as in the sketch; the following relations

The first of these comes from equating the up lift of the air to
the down pull of the tension; the second from equating the square
of the chord to four times the product of the segments of a normal
diameter.

The derived equation shows that if cia

In taut fabrics cia may equal
